In performing their assessment duties, the assessors shall personally examine each parcel of taxable real estate [during at least every third assessment cycle] every year, and shall personally examine each parcel of real estate that is not taxable during at least every fifth assessment cycle, as measured from the last preceding assessment cycle during which such parcel was personally examined.  Notwithstanding anything in the preceding sentence to the contrary, the assessors shall revalue, reassess or update the assessment of each parcel of [taxable or] nontaxable real estate during each assessment cycle, irrespective of whether such parcel was personally examined during each assessment cycle.\n      b.  The [persons] assessors having [charge of the borough assessment offices] been assigned district responsibilities shall furnish to the commissioner of finance, under oath, a detailed statement of all taxable real estate in the city.  Such statement shall contain the street, the section [or ward], volume, the block and lot and map or identification numbers of such real estate embraced within such district; the sum for which, in their judgment, each separately assessed parcel of real estate would sell under ordinary circumstances if it were wholly unimproved and, separately stated, the sum for which the same parcel would sell under ordinary circumstances with the improvements, if any, thereon, such sums to be determined with regard to the limitations contained in the state real property tax law.  [Such] The assessors shall include in such statement [shall include] such other information as the commissioner of finance may, from time to time, require.  \n      c.  Only certified assessors may furnish under oath any statements to the commissioner of finance. No assessor may furnish a statement under oath to the commissioner of finance for more than four volumes or to over one percent of the assessment of the city.  Regardless of these limitations, every certified assessor may furnish a statement under oath to the commissioner of finance for at least one volume.\n       � 2.
