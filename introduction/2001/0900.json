In nineteen hundred eighty, the Council enacted local law No. 51, which amended section 1174 of the city charter so as to increase the per diem fees to be paid to the impartial members of the board of collective bargaining, other than the director, to two hundred dollars commencing the first day of July, nineteen hundred eighty, and increasing these fees to two hundred fifty dollars commencing on the first day of January, nineteen hundred eighty-one. \n      This fee level has not been increased since 1981, although the demands placed upon the board members have steadily increased.  At the same time, the rates that arbitrators are paid to adjudicate cases under the direction of the board have steadily increased.\n      Therefore, in recognition of their dedicated service, it is the purpose of this law to permit the impartial members, other than the director, to receive fees equal to the fees paid to arbitrators.\n      ï¿½2. Subdivision (a) of section 1174 of chapter 54 of the New York City charter is amended to read as follows:\na. Board of collective bargaining: board of certification; director.  The city\n members and the labor members of the board of collective bargaining and their alternates shall serve without compensation.  The director shall be salaried for his or her services as director,  [chairman] chair of   the board of collective bargaining, and [chairman] chair of the board of certification.  [On  and after the first day of July, nineteen hundred eighty, the per diem fee to be paid to impartial members, other then the director, when actually rendering services as a member of either such board, shall be two hundred dollars.  The amount of such per diem fee shall be increased to two hundred fifty dollars on and after the first day of January, nineteen hundred eighty-one.]  The impartial members, excluding the director, shall be paid a per diem fee to be determined by the city members and labor members of the board of collective bargaining.  The director and all members of both such boards and their alternates shall be entitled to receive reimbursement for their actual and necessary expenses incurred in the performance of their duties.  Fifty per cent of the salary, fees, and expenses provided for in this subdivision shall be paid by members of the municipal committee, under rules and regulations issued by the board of collective bargaining, which rules may provide how such costs shall be distributed among such members.\n      ï¿½3.  This local law shall take effect immediately; provided, however, that the per diem fees for the impartial members of the board of collective bargaining shall remain two hundred fifty dollars until the city members and labor members of such board determine the rate to be paid to the impartial members.\n\nCHS:ts\n04/19/01\n\n1\n\n\n2",
