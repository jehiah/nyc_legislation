Any action or determination of a committee appointed under the provisions of this section shall be subject to approval or reversal by the board, which may also modify the determination of the committee in such way as the board shall deem proper and just, and the judgement of the board thereon shall be final.\n\tb.\tWhere, in the course of an investigation by the board, a committee of the board or officer or employee of the city school district of the city of New York, evidence or other information relating to a suspected crime involving the health or safety of a child is obtained, the board, committee, officer or employee which has conducted such investigation shall immediately report such evidence or other information to the police department, in a form and manner prescribed by rule by the police department, and to the principal of the child's school.  Provided, however, that if such evidence or other information directly or indirectly involves or implicates such school principal, the report shall be made to the district superintendent as well as the police department.\n\tc.\tAny such committee or individual who in good faith reports such suspected crime to the police department and school principal or district superintendent in accordance with the provisions of subdivision b of this section shall have immunity from any civil liability that may arise from the making of such report, and the school district or any school district employee shall not take, request or cause a retaliatory action against any such committee or individual who makes a report.\n\td.\tThe provisions of this section shall not be construed as either (1) limiting the authority of any agency, commission, other entity or its members to conduct any administrative, civil or criminal investigation that is within the scope of their authority, or (2) limiting any obligation to file a report with any city, state or federal agency concerning a suspected crime or other activity.\n\t�2.\tTitle 10 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 10-124, to read as follows:\n\t�10-124.
