  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n      Section 1.  Section 312 of the charter of the city of New York is amended by adding a subdivision a-1, to read as follows:\n      Section 312 a-1. An agency shall only enter into or renew a contract for services valued at or above the amounts established pursuant to section three hundred fourteen of the charter with a responsible contractor.  As used in this section, the term responsible contractor means a contractor or subcontractor who pays workers fair wages and fair benefits as evidenced by payroll and employee records.  Fair benefits include, but are not limited to, employer-supported family health care coverage, pension benefits and apprenticeship training programs.  A determination of payment of fair wages and fair benefits shall depend on the wages and benefits paid, the number of workers employed and the nature of the service or project contracted.  A contractor, who has a history of non-compliance with federal, state or local laws regulating employment or labor relations, will not be considered a responsible contractor.  Agency invitation for bids, request for proposals or other solicitations subject to the provisions of this charter shall include a request for all necessary and appropriate information for the agency to determine whether the contractor is a responsible contractor.  That information shall include but is not limited to the number and job classifications of full and part-time employees, wage and benefit rates - including family health care coverage, pension, sick annual and terminal leave - union status and a listing of any violations of federal, state and local labor and employment laws.  The agency shall forward any information concerning a contract to both the mayor and the comptroller, who shall thereafter publish said information consistent with the provisions of Section 6-116.2 of the administrative code.\n      ï¿½2. This local law shall take effect sixty days after its enactment into law.\n8\n\n\n2",
