In any year in which a primary, runoff primary, general or special election is to be held, any participating candidate for nomination or election to a city-wide, borough-wide, or city council office shall participate in two pre-election debates held pursuant to this section for each election in which he or she is on the ballot except that in the second general election debate the candidate shall meet such criteria for participation as may be specified in the application submitted by the debate sponsor pursuant to paragraph (b) of subdivision five of this section. In the case of a primary, the debate shall be among participating candidates seeking nomination of the same political party.
