  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\tSection 1.  The Council hereby finds and declares that certain amendments to the newsstand law adopted in 1997 as part of the Streetscape Task Force recommendations and subsequently repealed by the Council in 1998 when these recommendations were not fully instituted, would constitute sound improvements to the newsstand licensing law and, as such, should be re-adopted.\n\tThe Council further finds that these previously adopted amendments to the newsstand law include modernizing the language concerning who may hold a license to include, as with most other regulatory schemes, partnerships or corporations.  This amendment will provide to newsstand owners the same legal rights to form businesses as other entrepreneurs enjoy, without reducing the City's ability to control these businesses, and limit the maximum number of such businesses that any single licensee can maintain on public property, to two.\n\tThe Council further finds that it is appropriate to re-institute another previously approved amendment which would raise the maximum permitted selling price of non-printed materials to five dollars, allow prepaid telecommunication and transit cards to be sold, and prohibit sale of certain items at any price.\n\t�2.  Section 20-228 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding three new subdivisions c, d, and e, to read as follows:\n      c. Person.  A natural person, partnership, corporation or other association.\n      d. Emancipated child.
