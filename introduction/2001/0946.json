  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n            Section 1.  Legislative findings and intent.  The Council finds that clinical mercury thermometers that depend on the thermal expansion property of mercury, a highly toxic substance, to measure body temperature pose significant risks to human and environmental health.  The risks posed by these thermometers are great because when the glass enclosing the mercury breaks, the mercury may be absorbed internally or externally by the body and cause serious injury or contamination of the surrounding environment.  The Council further finds that there are adequate thermometer alternatives available that do not depend on the thermal expansion property of mercury to measure human body temperature.  The alternative temperature measuring devices that are available include disposable color change thermometers that use heat sensitive chemicals that respond to body heat by producing a stable color change in such chemicals, and electronic thermometers that measure temperature by means of a transducer that is coupled with an electronic signal amplification, conditioning and display unit.  Since viable alternatives to clinical mercury thermometers are available, and the risk of mercury contamination posed by their use is no longer acceptable and can be reduced and eventually eliminated by banning the sale of such thermometers, the Council finds that there is a compelling reason to ban the sale of such thermometers in the City of New York.\n\t�2.\tChapter 4 of title 20 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new subchapter 11 to read as follows:\n            Subchapter 11\n            Gauges Utilizing Mercury\n      �20-696  Ban on sale of mercury thermometers; penalties.
