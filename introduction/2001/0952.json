In making this determination, the board shall consider the following factors:\n\t(1) whether the item is of a highly personal nature;\n\t(2) whether the item in any way relates to the duties of the positions held by such person, including whether there are security or safety issues relating to such duties;\n\t(3)  whether the disclosure poses a risk to the security or safety of the reporting person or any other individual;\n\t(4) whether the item involves an actual or potential conflict of interest.\n\t(c) Any information regarding any financial interests of the spouse, domestic partner or an unemancipated child of a person filing in which the person filing has no financial interest shall be withheld from public inspection as an unwarranted invasion of privacy unless the conflicts of interest board determines that such information involves an actual or potential conflict of interest on the part of the person filing, subject to the factors set forth in subparagraph (b) of paragraph one of this subdivision.\n\t(d)  The conflicts of interest board shall establish procedures governing the withholding of information on the ground of privacy.  Such procedures shall include provision for the person who filed the information to appear in person to set forth, or submit a written statement setting forth, the reasons why the information should be withheld from public inspection.\n\t2.  Requests to examine reports.\nThe conflicts of interest board, upon receiving a written request by a member of the public, on such form as the board shall prescribe, to examine an item for which a written request to withhold information on the ground of privacy, safety or security concerns was submitted pursuant to this paragraph shall notify the person who filed the report that a request for inspection has been made. No such notification shall be required if the request to examine the report is made by the inspector general of the agency in which the person who filed the report is employed or the commissioner of investigation.\n\tf.  Retention of reports.    Reports filed pursuant to this section shall be retained by the conflicts of interest board for a period of two years following the termination of the public employment of the person who filed the report.

Such reports shall thereafter be destroyed by the board unless a request for public disclosure of an item contained in such report is pending. In lieu of the destruction of such reports, the board, in its discretion, may establish procedures providing for their return to the persons who filed them.\n\tg.  Penalties.\n\t1.

Such request shall be in writing and shall be in such form as the conflicts of interest board shall prescribe and shall set forth the reason such person believes the item should not be disclosed.\\par\n\\tab (b) The conflicts of interest board shall evaluate such request and any such item shall be withheld from public inspection upon a finding by the board that the inspection of such item by the public would constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy or a risk to the safety or security of any person.  In making this determination, the board shall consider the following factors:\\par\n\\tab (1) whether the item is of a highly personal nature;\\par\n\\tab (2) whether the item in any way relates to the duties of the positions held by such person, including whether there are security or safety issues relating to such duties;\\par\n\\tab (3)  whether the disclosure poses a risk to the security or safety of the reporting person or any other individual;\\par\n\\tab (4) whether the item involves an actual or potential conflict of interest.\\par\n\\tab (c) Any information regarding any financial interests of the spouse, domestic partner or an unemancipated child of a person filing in which the person filing has no financial interest shall be withheld from public inspection as an unwarranted invasion of privacy unless the conflicts of interest board determines that such information involves an actual or potential conflict of interest on the part of the person filing, subject to the factors set forth in subparagraph (b) of paragraph one of this subdivision.\\par\n\\tab (d)  The conflicts of interest board shall establish procedures governing the withholding of information on the ground of privacy.  Such procedures shall include provision for the person who filed the information to appear in person to set forth, or submit a written statement setting forth, the reasons why the information should be withheld from public inspection.\\par\n\\tab 2.  Requests to examine reports.\\par\nThe conflicts of interest board, upon receiving a written request by a member of the public, on such form as the board shall prescribe, to examine an item for which a written request to withhold information on the ground of privacy, safety or security concerns was submitted pursuant to this paragraph shall notify the person who filed the report that a request for inspection has been made. No such notification shall be required if the request to examine the report is made by the inspector general of the agency in which the person who filed the report is employed or the commissioner of investigation.\\par\n\\tab f.  Retention of reports.    Reports filed pursuant to this section shall be retained by the conflicts of interest board for a period of two years following the termination of the public employment of the person who filed the report. In the case of candidates for office who have filed reports pursuant to this section and who were not elected, the reports shall be retained by the board for a period of two years following the day of an election on which the candidates were defeated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the board, in consultation with the department of records and information services and the department of investigation, may establish by rule a different period or periods of retention of financial disclosure reports which takes into account the need for efficient records management and the need to retain such reports for a reasonable period for investigatory and other purposes. Such reports shall thereafter be destroyed by the board unless a request for public disclosure of an item contained in such report is pending. In lieu of the destruction of such reports, the board, in its discretion, may establish procedures providing for their return to the persons who filed them.\\par\n\\tab g.  Penalties.\\par\n\\tab 1.  Any person required to file a report pursuant to this section who has not so filed at the end of one week after the date required for filing shall be subject to a fine of one hundred dollars.

Any intentional violation of the provisions of this section, including but not limited to failure to file, failure to include assets or liabilities, and misstatement of assets or liabilities, shall constitute a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than one year or by a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars, or by both, and shall constitute grounds for imposition of disciplinary penalties, including removal from office in the manner provided by law.  In addition, any intentional violation of the provisions of this section may subject the person reporting to assessment by the conflicts of interest board of a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed ten thousand dollars.\\par\n\\tab 3.
