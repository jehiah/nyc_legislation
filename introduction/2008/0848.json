Under Section 957(d)(i) of the General Municipal Law, certain business enterprises located outside the boundaries of an Empire Zone may still be eligible for Empire Zone benefits as a “regionally significant project” because the economic activity of such enterprise is of a nature that is encouraged by the State, and the Administrative Board of such Empire Zone authorizes the designation of such business as a regionally significant project.  The New York State Department of Economic Development and the North Brooklyn/Brooklyn Navy Yard Empire Zone Administrative Board have determined that Aesthetonics, Inc., a manufacturer and distributor of high-end traditional lighting fixtures, is projected to create 67 new jobs and has been provisionally approved for Empire Zones benefits as a regionally significant project under Section 957(d)(i) of the General Municipal Law.  \n§2.
