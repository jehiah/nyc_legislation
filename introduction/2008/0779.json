Under Section 957(d)(i) of the General Municipal Law, certain business enterprises located outside the boundaries of an Empire Zone may still be eligible for Empire Zone benefits as a “regionally significant project” because the economic activity of such enterprise is of a nature that is encouraged by the State, and the Administrative Board of such Empire Zone authorizes the designation of such business as a regionally significant project.  The New York State Department of Economic Development and the Hunts Point Empire Zone Administrative Board have determined that the operation in the Bronx of Bronx Westchester Tempering Corporation’s manufacturing facility is projected to create 60 new jobs and has been provisionally approved for Empire Zones benefits as a regionally significant project under Section 957(d)(i) of the General Municipal Law.  \n§2.
