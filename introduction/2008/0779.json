The New York State Department of Economic Development and the Hunts Point Empire Zone Administrative Board have determined that the operation in the Bronx of Bronx Westchester Tempering Corporation’s manufacturing facility is projected to create 60 new jobs and has been provisionally approved for Empire Zones benefits as a regionally significant project under Section 957(d)(i) of the General Municipal Law.  \n§2.
