  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\nSection 1. Legislative findings and intent. The council of the city of New York finds that the right to access reproductive health services is an important personal right protected by state and federal law. Likewise, the right to peaceably protest and express one's views is protected by state and federal law. Such actions include, but are not limited to, the right to speak, march, demonstrate, picket, pray, associate with others in expressive behavior or engage in other activity protected by the First Amendment. The council is aware that there are individuals or groups of individuals who may exceed the boundaries of lawful First Amendment expression by engaging in physical activities that prevent access to reproductive health care facilities or by engaging in activities that unlawfully harass or intimidate individuals trying to access such facilities. Such activities unlawfully interfere with both the operators of reproductive health care facilities and all individuals seeking free entrance and egress from such facilities.\nThe council finds that current law does not adequately protect reproductive health care facilities and those who work in or seek services from such facilities. Therefore, the council finds it appropriate for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare, to enact new legislation to strengthen the prohibitions on interference with access to reproductive health care facilities and services.   \n§2. Section 8-801 of chapter 8 of title 8 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by Local Law 3 for the year 1994, is amended to read as follows.\n§8-801. Short title. This local law shall be known as the “access to reproductive health[ services] care facilities act.”\n§3. Current subdivision c of section 8-802 of chapter 8 of title 8 of the administrative code of the city of New York is REPEALED and a new subdivision c is added to read as follows:\nc. “Premises of a reproductive health care facility” shall mean the driveway, entrance, entryway, or exit of a reproductive health care facility and the building in which such facility is located and any parking lot in which the facility has an ownership or leasehold interest.\n§4. Section 8-803 of chapter 8 of title 8 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by Local Law 3 for the year 1994, is amended to read as follows:\n§8-803. Prohibition of activities to prevent access to reproductive health[ services] care facilities. a.

The council of the city of New York finds that the right to access reproductive health services is an important personal right protected by state and federal law. Likewise, the right to peaceably protest and express one's views is protected by state and federal law. Such actions include, but are not limited to, the right to speak, march, demonstrate, picket, pray, associate with others in expressive behavior or engage in other activity protected by the First Amendment. The council is aware that there are individuals or groups of individuals who may exceed the boundaries of lawful First Amendment expression by engaging in physical activities that prevent access to reproductive health care facilities or by engaging in activities that unlawfully harass or intimidate individuals trying to access such facilities. Such activities unlawfully interfere with both the operators of reproductive health care facilities and all individuals seeking free entrance and egress from such facilities.\\par\nThe council finds that current law does not adequately protect reproductive health care facilities and those who work in or seek services from such facilities. Therefore, the council finds it appropriate for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare, to enact new legislation to strengthen the prohibitions on interference with access to reproductive health care facilities and services.  \\cf0  \\cf1\\par\n\\cf0\\'a72.
