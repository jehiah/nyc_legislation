Under Section 957(d)(i) of the General Municipal Law, certain business enterprises located outside the boundaries of an Empire Zone may still be eligible for Empire Zone benefits as a “regionally significant project” because the economic activity of such enterprise is of a nature that is encouraged by the State, and the Administrative Board of such Empire Zone authorizes the designation of such business as a regionally significant project.  The New York State Department of Economic Development and the South Jamaica Empire Zone Administrative Board have determined that Flying Food Group LLC, a manufacturer and food processing and packaging company serving 85 airlines and nationally known retail food chains is projected to create more than 100 new jobs and has been provisionally approved for Empire Zones benefits as a regionally significant project under Section 957(d)(i) of the General Municipal Law.  \n§2.
