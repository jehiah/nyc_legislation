Notwithstanding any inconsistent provisions of subdivision e of section 254 of the New York city charter, as added by vote of the electors on November 7, 1989, if a capital budget and a capital program have not been adopted by June 10, 2008 pursuant to subdivisions a and b of such section, the unutilized portion of all prior capital appropriations shall be deemed reappropriated.\n7. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provisions of subdivision a of section 1515 of the New York city charter, as amended by vote of the electors on November 7, 1989, the Mayor shall pursuant to such subdivision prepare and submit to the Council an estimate of the probable amount of receipts as therein described not later than June 10, 2008.\n8.
