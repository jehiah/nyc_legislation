For purposes of this section, \"commercial building\" shall mean all buildings and structures, except those classified by this code in occupancy groups “I” or “R”. \nb.

Such motion detectors shall also be installed within one year of the effective date of this section for all existing commercial buildings.\nc. There shall be at least one motion detector for each unit of area determined by the commissioner by rule, but not less than one for every one hundred square feet or portion thereof of such building except for stairwells intended to be used in case of emergencies.  However, if a portion of such building may be fully enclosed in such a manner as the distance within such enclosed area is less than one hundred square feet and there is artificial light within such enclosed area, then a motion detector shall be installed within such enclosed area.\n§2.
