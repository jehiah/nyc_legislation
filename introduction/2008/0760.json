  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection 1.  Chapter 2 of title 28 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new article 217 to read as follows:\nArticle 217\nSAFETY Compliance Officer\n§28-217.1 Definition.  For purposes of this article, the terms “Safety Compliance Officer” and “SCO” shall mean a person whose presence is required by the commissioner pursuant to section 28-217.2 and who satisfies the qualifications of section 28-217.4.\n§28-217.2 Safety Compliance Officer. In addition to any other remedies or penalties authorized by law, the commissioner in his or her discretion may require the presence of a SCO at any permitted site that has received immediately hazardous violations that the commissioner determines adversely affect public safety and require the presence of a SCO to protect public safety. In any circumstance where a SCO is required, the commissioner shall state in writing the circumstances necessitating the SCO, and the duration of the compliance monitoring and/or conditions that must be satisfied prior to the termination of the compliance monitoring.    \n§28-217.3  Compliance monitoring.  The SCO shall monitor the operations related to the circumstances and conditions that the commissioner has identified pursuant to section 28-217.2 until the areas of concern set forth by the commissioner have been addressed as determined by the commissioner, but in no case shall any monitoring period exceed ninety days.  For such purpose, the SCO and his or her employees shall be designated as authorized representatives of the commissioner with authority pursuant to section 28-103.13 of this code to enter upon and examine and inspect at all reasonable times any site, building or structure. In the event that the conditions set-out in the commissioner’s determination, pursuant to section 28-217.2, to require a SCO have not been satisfied within the prescribed monitoring period, the commissioner may appoint  another SCO, who shall be a different SCO than the initial SCO, to monitor operations for an additional period not to exceed ninety days.\n§28-217.4  Qualifications. Safety Compliance Officers shall have experience in supervising the construction operations being monitored.  They shall be an architect or engineer who has experience supervising construction projects in New York City, a licensed site safety manager or coordinator or other licensee of the department, or a special inspector as provided for in article 115 of this title.  Safety Compliance Officers shall carry insurance as required by the department. \n§28-217.5 Cost of a Safety Compliance Officer.  The owner of the site where the services of the SCO have been required shall reimburse the department for all direct costs and any related administrative expenses incurred by the department in the operation of the SCO program provided for in this article.
