Section 28-204.2 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 33 for the year 2007, is amended to read as follows:\n§28-204.2 Order to certify correction. Each such notice of violation shall contain an order of the commissioner directing the respondent to correct the condition constituting the violation and to file [a certification] with the department electronically or in such other manner as the department may authorize by rule a certification that the condition has been corrected. Unless otherwise provided by rule, such order shall require that violations classified as major or lesser be corrected within 30 days from the date of the order [and], that violations classified as immediately hazardous be corrected forthwith.
