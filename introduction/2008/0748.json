  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\nSection 1.  Legislative findings and declaration.\n\nThe borough of Queens is justly proud of its ethnic and cultural diversity.  In recent years, food cart vendors have proliferated throughout the borough, serving a wide variety of international delicacies.  While the Council finds that mobile food vendors contribute to Queens’ reputation as a destination for visitors seeking edibles from around the world, the Council also finds that the concentration of vendors in certain areas of Queens with heavy vehicle and pedestrian traffic creates a serious and immediate threat to the health and safety of the public.  For this reason, the Council declares it necessary to restrict vending on the streets listed below.  \n§2.  Section 17-315 of the Administrative Code of the city of New York is hereby amended to add a new subsection m to read as follows:  \n\tm.  Food vendors shall be prohibited from vending at all times on the following streets in the borough of Queens: 69th Road between Queens Boulevard and Austin Street; 70th Avenue between Queens Boulevard and Austin Street; 70th Road between Queens Boulevard and Austin Street; 71st Avenue between Queens Boulevard and Austin Street; 71st Road between Queens Boulevard and Austin Street; 72nd Avenue between Queens Boulevard and Austin Street; 72nd Road between Queens Boulevard and Austin Street; Ascan Avenue between Queens Boulevard and Austin Street; Queens Boulevard between 69th Road and Ascan Avenue; and Austin Street between 69th Road and Ascan Avenue.  \n\t§3.
