  "Summary": "",
  "TextID": 43282,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\nSection 1.  Chapter 1 of title 11 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 11-129 to read as follows: \n§11-129  Department of finance statement of account.  a. At intervals determined by the commissioner of finance, the department of finance shall send to owners of real property a statement of account for the property, which shall represent a bill for taxes, charges and assessments, and which shall include, in a manner determined by the commissioner, a description of taxes, charges and assessments that remain unpaid on the property, and payments received by the department for taxes, charges and assessments on the property, and which may include additional information as the commissioner deems appropriate.\nb. The statement of account shall be  sent to owners who notified the department of a mailing address for such statements, or, if no mailing address has been so provided, to the owner of record at the property address appearing on the assessment roll.\nc. Notwithstanding subdivision b of this section, in lieu of mailing the statement of account, the department may send the statement of account by electronic means to any owner whose electronic mailing address is known to the department.\n§2. Section 27-2129 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\n § 27-2129 Statement of account.  Whenever the department has incurred expenses for the repair of a dwelling or for the elimination of any dangerous or unlawful conditions therein, pursuant to this article or any other provision of the administrative code or any other applicable provision of law, [it] the department, its authorized representative, or the department of finance may [serve upon] send to the owner or his or her designee in the manner provided in section [27-2095 of article one of subchapter four of this code] 11-129 of the administrative code a statement of account with the expense incurred and a demand for payment thereof. If the owner does not [within thirty days of service of such statement,] notify the department in writing of his or her objection to the first statement of [expenses or any individual item therein,] account containing such charge before the date that  such charge becomes due and payable as provided in subdivision b of section 27-2144 of article eight of this subchapter, such owner may not in any subsequent judicial or administrative proceeding contest [any item] the expense contained in such statement.  The department will only review such objections that are received by it in writing on or prior to the due and payable date for the charge provided on the second statement of account containing such charge.. \n§3. Section 27-2144 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\n§ 27-2144 Lien on premises.   a. There shall be filed in the office of the department a record of all work caused to be performed by or on behalf of the department. Such records shall be kept on a building-by-building basis and shall be accessible to the public during business hours.  Such record may be made and maintained electronically.  Within thirty days after the issuance of a purchase or work order to cause a repair to be made by or on behalf of the department, entry of such order shall be made on the records of the department.  Such record may be made and maintained electronically. Such record shall be deemed to be entered on the date that such record is entered electronically on the records of the department.  Such entry shall constitute notice to all parties. \nb. All expenses incurred by the department for the repair or the elimination of any dangerous or unlawful conditions therein, pursuant to this chapter or any other applicable provision of law, shall constitute a lien upon the premises when [the amount thereof shall have been definitely computed as a statement of account by the department and the department shall cause to be filed in the office of the city collector an entry of the account stated in the book in which such charges against the premises are to be entered] such charge is due and payable, which, notwithstanding any other provision of law, shall be the due and payable date for such charge provided on the second statement of account containing such charge.  Such lien shall have a priority over all other liens and encumbrances on the premises except for the lien of taxes and assessments. However, no lien created pursuant to this chapter shall be enforced against a subsequent purchaser in good faith or mortgagee in good faith unless the requirements of subdivision a of this section are satisfied; this limitation shall only apply to transactions occurring after the date such record should have been entered pursuant to subdivision a and the date such entry was made.  \nc.
