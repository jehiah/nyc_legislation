If a person in charge of a vehicle, other than a police officer, requests that a vehicle be towed to a location other than an authorized storage or auxiliary storage facility, an additional charge of four dollars per mile may be charged from place where the vehicle is parked or disabled to the location where the vehicle is towed, provided, however, that such distance shall be measured on a route available for commercial vehicles from the place where such vehicle is parked or disabled to the location to which such vehicle is towed.\n\tc.
