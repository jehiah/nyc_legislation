  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection 1.  Article 1 of subchapter 2 of title 27 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 27-2009.2 to read as follows:\n§27-2009.2. Rights of senior citizens to maintain pets in multiple dwellings.  a. Legislative intent.  The City Council hereby finds that pet companionship can have a beneficial impact on the physical and mental health of pet owners. Studies have demonstrated that senior citizens with pets live longer, visit the doctor less often, cope better with stressful life situations such as the loss of a spouse, and recover more quickly from illnesses.  There exists a significant public interest and purpose in preserving and enhancing the quality of life of the City’s senior citizens.  Such citizens should not be compelled to choose between remaining in their homes and having the therapeutic benefit of pet companionship. The City continues to experience an affordable housing crisis and the shortage of such housing offers senior citizens, many with limited incomes, few options if they are forced to leave their homes due to their need for pet companionship. Eviction of senior citizens from multiple dwellings or the failure to grant housing due to pet ownership is harmful to the public welfare.\nb. Notwithstanding the provisions of any lease, rental agreement, or contract to the contrary, or any other applicable provision of law, no person aged sixty-two years or older shall be denied occupancy in a multiple dwelling or be subject to eviction from any such dwelling solely on the ground that such person owns or keeps a household pet or pets, of such type or species that the harboring of which is not prohibited by this code, the multiple dwelling law or any other applicable law.  This section shall also not apply where the harboring of such pet causes damage to the subject premises, creates a nuisance or interferes substantially with the health, safety or welfare of other tenants or lawful occupants of the multiple dwelling. \n§2.  This local law shall take effect immediately.\n\nBH\nLS # 4397\n4/2/2008 11:47 AM",
