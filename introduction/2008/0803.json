  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\nSection 1.  Declaration of legislative findings and intent.\nThe city council finds and declares that the current system of privately financed campaigns diminishes the meaning of the right to vote by allowing large contributions to have a deleterious influence on the political process. The current system also violates the rights of all citizens to equal and meaningful participation in the democratic or political process. It diminishes the free-speech rights of non-wealthy voters and candidates whose voices are muffled by those who can afford to monopolize political communications. Additionally, the current system fuels the public perception of conflicts of interest and the domination of special money interests. That perception undermines the electorate’s confidence in the democratic process. It also makes it very difficult for qualified candidates without access to large contributors or personal fortunes to mount competitive campaigns. Because it places challengers at a distinct disadvantage, the system inhibits the free exchange of ideas and communication with the electorate.\nThe city council finds and declares that providing a voluntary clean elections campaign finance system would enhance democracy. It would help eliminate the deleterious influence of large contributions on the political process, remove access to wealth as a major determinant of a citizen’s influence within the political process, and restore the meaning of the principle of \"one person, one vote.\" It would also help restore the rights of all citizens to equal and meaningful participation in the democratic process.\nInstituting a public financing program would restore the free-speech rights of non-wealthy candidates and voters by providing candidates with resources with which to communicate ideas with the electorate. Such a system would thus help enhance the First Amendment rights of the electorate and candidates to be heard in the political process. It would help restore the core First Amendment value of open and robust debate in the political process. It would also diminish the electorate’s perception of domination of special interests and strengthen the public’s confidence in the democratic process and institutions. By providing for public financing, this act also addresses the genuine concern about the amount of time and effort that a candidate must devote to raising campaign funds.\nSection 2. Title 3, Chapter 7 of the administrative code of the City of New York is amended as follows:\nCHAPTER 7\nCAMPAIGN FINANCING\n§ 3-701 Short title. This chapter shall be known as the \"New York City [campaign finance] clean elections act.\"\n§ 3-702 Definitions.

The term \"principal committee\" shall mean the authorized committee designated by a candidate pursuant to paragraph (e) of subdivision 1 of section 3-703 [or paragraph (a) of subdivision one of section 3-718] of this chapter.\n3.

Such form shall contain in prominent typeface and in a prominent location the statement “If a contributor has business dealings with the City as defined in the campaign finance act, such contributor may contribute only up to two hundred fifty dollars for city council, three hundred twenty dollars for borough president and four hundred dollars for mayor, comptroller or public advocate.” Upon receipt of the response to such inquiry (including any failure to respond), the principal committee shall keep a copy in its records and shall report each contribution to the board on the next applicable filing deadline in accordance with the board’s disclosure schedule. The board shall check each contribution against the doing business database and shall notify the principal committee within twenty days of the reporting of such contribution if a contribution exceeding the doing business contribution limitation set forth in subdivision 1-a of section 3-703 is subject to such limitations of this subchapter or if a contribution is not matchable pursuant to such subdivision. Notwithstanding any provision in this subdivision, in the six weeks preceding the covered election the board shall provide such notification to the principal or authorized committee within three business days of the reporting of such contribution to the board in accordance with applicable reporting deadlines. If the board fails to notify the principal committee that a contribution is in excess of the limitations set forth in subdivision 1-a of section 3-703 of this chapter in accordance with this subdivision, any such contribution shall be deemed valid for purposes of such limitation provided, however, that no such contribution shall be matchable. Such principal committee shall have twenty days from the date of any such notification to return the amount of any contribution in excess of the limitations set forth in subdivision 1-a of section 3-703 to the contributor. No violation shall issue and no penalty shall be imposed where such excess amount is postmarked or delivered within twenty days of such notification by the board and the board shall not designate a candidate as having accepted a contribution in excess of such limitations where such excess has been returned in accordance with the time limitations set forth herein. Failure to return such excess amount in accordance with the provisions herein shall not result in the board withholding public funds for which the participating candidate’s principal committee is otherwise eligible pursuant to section 3-705 of this chapter; provided, however, that the board may deduct an amount equal to the total unreturned contributions in excess of the limitations set forth in subdivision 1-a of section 3-703 of this chapter from such payment of public funds. For purposes of this section, “individual” shall include any chief executive officer, chief financial officer, and/or chief operating officer of an entity or persons serving in an equivalent capacity, any person in a senior managerial capacity regarding an entity, or any person with an interest in an entity, which exceeds ten percent of the entity. For purposes of this subdivision, the phrase “senior managerial capacity” shall mean a high-level supervisory capacity, either by virtue of title or duties, in which substantial discretion and oversight is exercised over the solicitation, letting or administration of business transactions with the city, including contracts, franchises, concessions, grants, economic development agreements, and applications for land use approvals. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no participating candidate shall be liable for any fine or penalty for the failure of any contributor to respond to any such request or for any erroneous response.]\n2.

Disclosure reports shall be submitted at such times and in such form as the board shall require and shall be clearly legible.\n(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) above:\n(i) an intermediary need not be reported for any qualifying contribution to a [participating or limited participating] qualified candidate and his or her [principal] authorized committee or for any contribution to a non-participating candidate and his or her authorized committees that was collected from a contributor in connection with a party or other candidate-related event held at the residence of the person delivering the contribution, unless the expenses of such events at such residence for such candidate exceed [five] three hundred dollars for a covered election or the aggregate contributions received from that contributor at such events exceed five hundred dollars;\n(ii) contributions aggregating not more than ninety-nine dollars from any one contributor for all covered elections held in a single calendar year or for a special election, and all qualifying contributions from any one contributor to a qualified candidate,  need not be separately itemized in disclosure reports submitted to the board on behalf of a [participating, or limited participating] qualified or non-participating candidate and his or her principal committee or authorized committees[, provided, however, that contributions which are not itemized shall not be matchable];\n(iii) the treasurer of the principal committee need not collect or disclose the occupation, employer, and business address of any contributor making contributions aggregating not more than ninety-nine dollars for all covered elections held in a single calendar year or for a special election or any contributor making qualifying contributions to a qualified candidate or his or her authorized committee; [provided, however, such occupation, employer, and business address shall be disclosed if such contributors are employees of a participating or limited participating candidate or the spouse or domestic partner of such candidate or an entity in which such candidate, spouse or domestic partner has an ownership interest of ten percent or more or a management position, including, but not limited to, being an officer, director or trustee;] and\n(iv) disclosure reports, other than reports required to be filed every six months in accordance with the schedule specified by the New York state board of elections, need not be submitted on behalf of a [participating or limited participating] qualified candidate and his or her authorized committee or a non-participating candidate and his or her authorized committees if the cumulative amount of contributions and loans accepted by such candidate and committee following the period covered in the last disclosure report submitted to the campaign finance board on behalf of such candidate is less than two thousand dollars or such higher amount as may be determined by the campaign finance board, provided, however, that disclosure reports shall be submitted on behalf of a [participating or limited participating] qualified candidate and his or her authorized committee or a non-participating candidate and his or her authorized committees if that candidate and his or her committee have made expenditures in excess of forty-five percent of the expenditure limitation applicable to [participating or limited participating] qualified candidates under section 3-706.

Each disclosure report filed pursuant to subdivision six of this section shall include the date of receipt of each contribution accepted.\n11. Regardless whether a [participating] qualified candidate demonstrates eligibility for optional public financing under this chapter, a [participating] qualified candidate and his or her principal committee are nonetheless required to abide by the requirements of paragraphs (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (k) and (l) of subdivision one of this section.\n12. [(a) Each participating candidate or limited participating candidate for nomination for election, or election, or the principal committee of such candidate, shall submit, in a contemporaneous manner, the disclosure reports required pursuant to this chapter, filed in accordance with the schedule specified by the state board of elections for the filing of campaign receipt and expenditure statements, and such other disclosure reports as the rules of the board may require, in order for any contributions received during the periods covered by such reports and prior to the last date upon which such candidate may file a certification pursuant to paragraph (c) of subdivision one of this section to qualify as matchable contributions.\n(b) The board shall review each disclosure report timely submitted by a candidate prior to the last date upon which such candidate may file a certification pursuant to paragraph (c) of subdivision one of this section, or subdivision one of section 3-718, and issue to the candidate a review before the next disclosure report is due. Such review shall inform the candidate of relevant questions the board has concerning the candidate's: (i) compliance with requirements of this chapter and of the rules issued by the board; and (ii) qualification for receiving public funds pursuant to this chapter. In the course of this review, the board shall give candidates an opportunity to respond to and correct potential violations, before the deadline for filing a certification pursuant to paragraph (c) of subdivision one of this section, or subdivision one of section 3-718, and give candidates an opportunity to address questions the board has concerning their matchable contribution claims or other issues concerning eligibility for receiving public funds pursuant to this chapter; provided, however, this paragraph shall not apply to the last required disclosure report before the deadline for filing a certification pursuant to paragraph (c) of subdivision one of this section or subdivision one of section 3-718. Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude the board from subsequently reviewing such disclosure reports and taking any action otherwise authorized under this chapter.\n13. Candidates who file a certification pursuant to subdivision one of this section shall not be eligible to file a certification pursuant to section 3-718, and candidates who file a certification pursuant to section 3-718 shall not be eligible to file a certification pursuant to subdivision one of this section.\n14.

These expenditures shall, at a minimum, include all expenditures made by the political committee making the transfer during the election cycle of the covered election.

Any disclosure software issued by the board on or after January 1, 2008 shall enable users to meet their electronic disclosure obligations under this chapter and under article 14 of the election law, as amended by chapter 406 of the laws of 2005.\n8. The board shall have the authority to promulgate such rules and regulations and provide such forms as it deems necessary for the administration of this chapter. The board shall promulgate regulations concerning the form in which contributions and expenditures are to be reported, the periods during which such reports must be filed and the verification required.

Such data base shall be accessible to the public.\n10. The board shall have the authority to implement any system established for the regulation of inauguration and transition donations and expenditures including the promulgation of rules and regulations and the imposition of any penalties related thereto, as required by local law. The specific powers enumerated in subdivisions 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 11 of this section, for purposes of this chapter, shall also be applicable in full for purposes of such chapter 8.\n11.

There is hereby established a special fund, to be known as the New York City clean election campaign finance fund. The moneys in such fund may be expended by the campaign finance board only as payments for [participating] qualified candidates in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.\n2. The fund shall be kept separate and shall be credited with all sums appropriated therefor, any donations received pursuant to subdivision nine of this section, [and] all earnings accruing on such funds and any monies realized from the provisions of subdivisions seven, nine and ten of this section and subdivision three of section 3-710 of this chapter.\n3. As soon as practicable in the year nineteen hundred eighty-eight and in time for inclusion in the executive expense budget in every year thereafter, and at such other times as the board shall deem necessary, the board shall submit its estimate of the amount of public funds which will be necessary to provide candidates sufficient financing for elections in the next year in which elections are scheduled pursuant to the charter and for elections to fill vacancies to be held prior to such year, and a reserve for contingencies. Such estimates shall be submitted in such manner and at such times as to assure that such amounts as shall be necessary may be appropriated in full by the beginning of the fiscal year prior to that in which elections are scheduled pursuant to the charter and that additional amounts may be appropriated as necessary.\n4. The moneys in such fund shall be paid to [participating] qualified candidates by the board upon its certification that such candidates qualify for such funds.\n5. No moneys shall be paid to [participating] qualified candidates in a primary election any earlier than [two weeks after the last day to file designating petitions for such primary election] than April 1 of the year in which such primary election shall take place, and in a general election any earlier than the day after the day of the primary election held to nominate candidates for such election.\n6. (a) No moneys shall be paid to [participating] qualified candidates in a run-off primary election held pursuant to section 6-162 of the election law or in a general election any earlier than the day after the day of the primary election held to nominate candidates for such election.\n(b) No moneys shall be paid to [participating] qualified candidates in a run-off special election held to fill a vacancy any earlier than the day after the day of the special election for which such run-off special election is held.\n7. No moneys shall be paid to any [participating] qualified candidate who has been finally disqualified [or whose designating or nominating petitions have been finally declared invalid by the New York city board of elections or a court of competent jurisdiction]. Any payment from the fund in the possession of such a candidate or his or her [principal] authorized committee on the date of such final disqualification or invalidation may not thereafter be expended for any purpose except the payment of liabilities incurred in qualified campaign expenditures before such date and shall be promptly repaid to the fund.\n8. Prior to the first distribution of public funds to candidates in any election, the board shall make a determination whether the moneys in the fund are sufficient to provide all candidates the amounts they may receive pursuant to this chapter for all elections to be held during the calendar year for which such determination is made. Such determination shall be published in the City Record, together with information supporting such determination.\n9. The board shall be empowered to accept donations to be credited to the fund. The board may devise such methods of soliciting and collecting donations as it may deem feasible and appropriate.\n10. (a) A qualified candidate who has been defeated in a primary election or who fails to remain as a candidate throughout a primary or general election period shall return all unspent funds that were raised or distributed to him or her to the fund.\n(b) All other qualified candidates shall return all unspent qualifying campaign contributions and other fund revenues that were distributed to him or her to the fund.\n11. The aggregate amount which may be provided to qualified candidates in any four-year election cycle from the fund shall not exceed one tenth of one percent of the total expenditures made pursuant to appropriations made by law during such time period. If the amount of funds for which qualified candidates have qualified reaches or exceeds this level, the board of elections shall reduce, by an equal percentage for all candidates, the respective amount of public financing made available to qualified candidates.\n12. Upon certifying that a candidate is eligible for clean election campaign financing, the campaign finance board shall disburse such funds as shall be made available to the candidate directly to the candidate’s or his or her authorized committee’s campaign account.\n13. A qualified candidate and his or her representative and authorized committee are prohibited from paying for campaign expenses in any way other than by use of the funds deposited into the candidate’s or his or her authorized committee’s campaign account, except as exempted in subdivision four of this section. The use of clean election campaign funds to general personal credit or a loan is prohibited.\n14.  All forms of payment shall be permissible only if they are drawn directly from the clean election funds in the candidate’s or his or her authorized committee’s campaign account, except as exempted in subdivision fifteen of this section.\n(a) All campaign purchases for goods and services shall be paid for with money drawn from the candidate’s or his or her authorized committee’s campaign account at the time of purchase, except that fees for services, including salaries and fees for staff members and consultants, may be made available at any time up until the last day of the relevant primary, special or general campaign periods.\n(b) Estimated payments for utility bills, including telephone, heat and electricity charges, shall be made available by the last day of the relevant election period. In budgeting their projected expenses, qualified candidates must estimate the cost of utilities. The board is authorized to provide a formula for such estimates.\n15. A petty cash fund may be established consistent with the other provisions of this chapter.\n(a) Qualified candidates may have a daily petty cash fund, for daily expenses, including food, newspapers, magazines, public telephones, and other minor necessities unrelated to the direct operating costs of the campaign. The daily maximum amount of the petty cash fund shall be established by the board.\n(b) All cash expenditures in excess of twenty-five dollars require a cash receipt specifying the item purchased and its purpose, its cost, and the place of purchase.\n§ 3-709.5 Mandatory debates. 1. (a) In any year in which a primary, general or special election is to be held, any [participating candidate and any limited participating] qualified candidate for nomination or election [to a city-wide office] shall participate in [either of the] two pre-election debates[, or both,] held pursuant to this section for which he or she is eligible and is required to debate pursuant to this section. A [participating candidate or limited participating] qualified candidate for nomination or election to a city-wide office [is eligible to] shall participate in [a] three debates for each general election in which he or she is on the ballot [if he or she has met such criteria for participation] as shall be specified in any agreement between the debate sponsor and the board. Any non-participating candidate who meets the criteria for participation may also participate in all such debates.\n(b) In any year in which a run-off primary or run-off special election to fill a vacancy for a city-wide office is held, any [participating candidate and any limited participating] qualified candidate for nomination or election to such city-wide office who is on the ballot shall participate in one run-off election debate. Any non-participating candidate who meets the criteria for participation may also participate in all such debate.\n(c) In the case of a primary, the debate shall be among [participating candidates and limited participating] qualified candidates seeking the nomination of the same political party who meet the requirements provided in paragraph (a) of this subdivision, and all non-participating candidates who meet the requirements provided in paragraph (a) of this subdivision and who choose to participate in such debates. If there is no contested primary for an office in a political party then no debate for that party's nomination shall be held pursuant to this section.\n(d) Each debate held pursuant to this section shall be at least one hour's duration.\n2. For purposes of this section, a \"debate\" shall mean the moderated reciprocal discussion of issues among candidates on the ballot for the same office.\n3. The campaign finance board shall select one or more sponsors for each debate required pursuant to this section. For primary, general and special elections, the second and third debates shall be [a debate] among the leading contenders for the office, as described in paragraph (b) of subdivision five of this section.\n4. Organizations which are not affiliated with any political party or with any holder of or candidate for public office, which have not endorsed any candidate in the pending primary, special, general, or run-off election for the city-wide office shall be eligible to sponsor one or more of the required debates. The rules for conducting such debates shall be solely the responsibility of the organizations selected but shall not be made final without consultation with the campaign finance board. The organizations selected shall be responsible for choosing the date, time and location of the debates.\n5. Written applications by organizations to sponsor a debate shall be submitted to the campaign finance board on a form provided by the board not later than a date chosen by the board in any year in which an election is held for city-wide offices.\n(a) The written application shall:\n(i) demonstrate that the organization and any proposed co-sponsor meet the criteria of subdivision four of this section;\n(ii) specify the election and office for which the organization seeks to sponsor the debate;\n(iii) set forth the date, time, duration, and location of the debate and the specific and exclusive circumstances under which the date or time may be changed, together with a provision for when the rescheduled debate would be held;\n(iv) provide a detailed description of the format and ground rules for the debate;\n(v) verify that the staging, promotion, and coverage of the debate shall be in conformance with all applicable laws;\n(vi) include an agreement to indemnify the city for any liability arising from the acts or omissions of the sponsor; and\n(vii) set forth plans for publicity and for broadcast and other media coverage for the debate; and\n(viii) set forth the criteria for determining which candidates are eligible to participate in each debate the organization seeks to sponsor, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this subdivision.\n(b)(i) Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (ii) below, each debate for a primary, general or special election shall include only those [participating candidates or limited participating] candidates the sponsor of each such debate has determined meet the non-partisan, objective, and non-discriminatory criteria set forth in any agreement between the sponsor and the board; provided, however, that the criteria for [the first] each debate for a primary, general, or special election shall provide, among other criteria, [(A)] that a [participating] qualified candidate shall be eligible to participate in such debate if he or she has achieved ballot status by collecting sufficient qualifying contributions, and a non-participating candidate shall be eligible to participate in such debate if he or she has achieved ballot status through the petition process [by the last filing date prior to such debate, (I) spent, contracted, or obligated to spend, and (II) received in contributions, an amount equal to or more than twenty percent of the threshold for eligibility for public funding applicable to participating candidates contained in subdivision two of section 3-703, and (B) that a limited participating candidate shall be eligible to participate in such debate if he or she has, by the last filing date prior to such debate, spent, contracted, or obligated to spend, an amount equal to or more than twenty percent of the threshold for eligibility for public funding applicable to participating candidates seeking the office for which such debate is being held contained in subdivision two of section 3-703; provided however, that for the purpose of determining whether a candidate has met the financial criteria to be eligible to participate in such debate, only contributions raised and spent in compliance with the act shall be used to determine whether the candidate has raised and spent twenty percent of the threshold for eligibility for public funding applicable to participating candidates contained in subdivision two of section 3-703]; provided, further, that the second and third debates for a primary, general, or special election shall include only those [participating] qualified candidates or [limited] non-participating candidates who the sponsor has also determined are leading contenders on the basis of additional non-partisan, objective, and non-discriminatory criteria set forth in any agreement between the sponsor and the board. Nothing in this provision is intended to limit the debates to the two major political parties.\n(ii) If a debate sponsor has determined that a non-participating candidate has met all the non-partisan, objective, and non-discriminatory criteria applicable to [participating candidates or limited participating] qualified candidates for access to any of the primary, general, or special election debates, the sponsor may invite that candidate to participate in such debate. In the case of a run-off primary election or a run-off special election, the sponsor may invite a non-participating candidate to participate in such debate. However, if a non-participating candidate does not accept such invitation to debate or does not appear at such debate, the debate shall go forward as scheduled; provided, however, if there is only one [participating candidate or limited participating] candidate participating in any such debate, such debate shall be canceled.\n6. Prior to choosing a sponsor, the board shall provide for the receipt of comments from interested persons regarding the qualifications of potential sponsors. The board shall consider and give substantial weight to such comments submitted by candidates.\n7. Based upon the criteria in subdivision four above and any comments received pursuant to subdivision six above, the board shall select the organization or organizations to sponsor the debates and shall provide written notification to the organization or organizations so selected. In addition to the sufficiency of the application, the board shall consider the applicant's ability to reach a wide audience and present a fair and impartial debate. The board may accept an application subject to modifications as it deems appropriate and as are acceptable to the sponsor.\n8. For all debates, the board shall provide each debate sponsor it has selected with a list of [participating] qualified candidates and [limited] non-participating candidates who are eligible to be considered to participate in such debates.\n9. If a candidate fails to participate in any debate required under this section before an election, the candidate shall be liable for return of any [public matching] clean election campaign funds previously received pursuant to the certification filed by the candidate in connection with the election for which such debate is held, shall be ineligible to receive any further [matching] clean election campaign funds for that election, and may be subject to a civil penalty pursuant to section 3-711. For purposes of this subdivision, each primary, general, special or run-off election shall be considered a separate election.\n10. Following the submission of a petition on behalf of the candidate and a hearing before the board, the sanction or sanctions provided in subdivision nine of this section applicable to a candidate for failure to participate in any debate as required under this section may be waived upon a determination by the board that the failure to participate in the debate occurred under circumstances beyond the control of the candidate and of such nature that a reasonable person would find the failure justifiable or excusable.\n11. Nothing contained in this section shall preclude any candidate from agreeing to participate in any number of additional debates between any and all candidates [for a city-wide office,] including non-participating candidates [or limited participating candidates]. These debates need not be held under guidelines or the purview of the campaign finance board.\n12. The city of New York shall indemnify each sponsor for any liability of such sponsor arising out of the acts or omissions of the city of New York in connection with the selection of candidates for participation in any debate held pursuant to this section 3-709.5.\n§ 3-710 Examinations and audits; repayments. 1. The campaign finance board is hereby empowered to audit and examine all matters relating to the performance of its functions and any other matter relating to the proper administration of this chapter and of chapter 8 of title 3 of this code. The board shall conduct its campaign audits in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards, and shall promulgate rules regarding what documentation is sufficient in demonstrating financial activity. These audit and examination powers extend to all [participating candidates, and limited participating] qualified candidates, and non-participating candidates, and the principal and authorized committees of all [participating, limited participating,] qualified and non-participating candidates, provided that:\na. Any draft audit, the subject of which is a [participating, limited participating] qualified or non-participating candidate, or the principal and/or authorized committees of any [participating, limited participating] qualified or non-participating candidate shall be completed within (i) eight months after the submission of the final disclosure report for the covered election for city council races and borough-wide races, and (ii) ten months after the submission of the final disclosure report for the covered election for citywide races, unless the subject of such audit consents in writing to a longer period of time;\nb. The campaign finance board shall provide each candidate a final audit, which shall contain the final resolution of all issues raised in the draft audit; such final audit shall be provided to the candidate, where such candidate or such candidate’s campaign manager or treasurer has completed audit training provided by the board, within (i) fourteen months after the submission of the final disclosure report for the covered election, for city council races and borough-wide races, and (ii) sixteen months after the submission of the final disclosure report for the covered election for citywide races, unless the subject of such audit consents in writing to a longer period of time. Where such candidate or such candidate’s campaign manager or treasurer has not completed audit training provided by the campaign finance board, such final audit shall be provided to such candidate within (i) sixteen months after the submission of the final disclosure report for the covered election, for city council races and borough-wide races, and (ii) eighteen months after the submission of the final disclosure report for the covered election for citywide races, unless the subject of such audit consents in writing to a longer period of time. Provided, however, that where the issuance of such final audit is preceded by a notice of violations and recommended penalties and/or a notice of repayment of public funds, such notice or notices shall include all potential penalties and/or repayment obligations and a notice of a candidate’s right to a hearing pursuant to section 3-710.5 or section 3-710(4) of this chapter and shall be provided to the candidate according to the deadlines applicable to final audits as set forth in this paragraph.\nc. Any advice provided by board staff to a [participating, limited participating,] qualified or non-participating candidate with regard to an action shall be presumptive evidence that such action taken in reliance on such advice should not be subject to a penalty or repayment obligation where such candidate or such candidate’s committee has confirmed such advice in a writing to such board staff by registered or certified mail to the correct address, or by electronic or facsimile transmission with evidence of receipt, describing the action to be taken pursuant to the advice given and the board or its staff has not responded to such written confirmation within seven business days disavowing or altering such advice, provided that the board’s response shall be by registered or certified mail to the correct address, or by electronic or facsimile transmission with evidence of receipt.\nd. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs a and b of this subdivision, if a committee has failed to respond to a request for information made by board auditors during the post-election audit process, the time period for completing the draft and final audits shall be tolled and extended by the number of days by which the committee has exceeded the original deadline for a response, provided that the committee has received timely written notice of: (i) the original deadline to provide the information, which shall not have been less than thirty days from the date such information was requested; and (ii) the commencement of the tolling period pursuant to this section. If a committee has responded to a request for information made by board auditors but such response is inadequate, the time period for completing the draft and final audits shall be tolled and extended by the number of days until an adequate response is provided, provided that the committee has received timely written notice of: (i) the original deadline to provide the information, which shall not have been less than thirty days from the date such information was requested; (ii) the commencement of the tolling period pursuant to this section; and (iii) the detailed reasons why the original response was inadequate.\ne. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the deadlines provided in paragraphs a and b of this subdivision for the completion of draft and final audits shall not apply in cases where the audit raises issues involving potential campaign-related fraud, potential other criminal activity, or activity that may constitute a breach of certification pursuant to rules of the board or potential significant violations of the limits set forth in section 3-706.\nf. Notwithstanding any provision of the law to the contrary, the deadlines provided in paragraphs a and b of this subdivision for the completion of draft and final audits shall not apply in the event that board operations are interrupted due to a catastrophic emergency such as a natural disaster or criminal event, provided that once board operations resume, the board shall within two weeks announce new deadlines for the completion of draft and final audits consistent with paragraphs a and b.\n2. (a) If the board determines that any portion of the payment made to the [principal] authorized committee of a [participating] qualified candidate from the fund was in excess of the aggregate amount of payments which such candidate was eligible to receive pursuant to this chapter, it shall notify such committee and such committee shall pay to the board an amount equal to the amount of excess payments.\n(b) If the board determines that any portion of the payment made to a [principal] authorized committee of a [participating] qualified candidate from the fund was used for purposes other than qualified campaign expenditures, it shall notify such candidate and committee of the amount so disqualified and such candidate and committee shall pay to the board an amount equal to such disqualified amount; provided, however that in considering whether or not a [participating] qualified candidate shall be required to pay to the board such amount or an amount less than the entire disqualified amount, the board shall act in accordance with the following: (i) where credible documentation supporting each qualified campaign expenditure exists but is incomplete, the board shall not impose such liability for such expenditure; and (ii) where there is an absence of credible documentation for each qualified campaign expenditure, the board may impose liability upon a showing that such absence of credible documentation for such expenditure arose from a lack of adequate controls including, but not limited to trained staff, internal procedures to follow published board guidelines and procedures to follow standard financial controls.\n(c) If the total of contributions, other receipts, and payments from the fund received by a [participating] qualified candidate and his or her [principal] authorized committee exceed the total campaign expenditures of such candidate and committee for all covered elections held in the same calendar year or for a special election to fill a vacancy such candidate and committee shall use such excess funds to reimburse the fund for payments received by such committee from the fund during such calendar year or for such special election. No such excess funds shall be used for any other purpose, unless the total amount of the payments received from the fund by the principal committee has been repaid.\n3. If a [participating] qualified candidate whose [principal] authorized committee has received public funds is disqualified by a court of competent jurisdiction on the grounds that such candidate committed fraudulent acts in order to obtain a place on the ballot and such decision is not reversed, such candidate and his or her [principal] authorized committee shall pay to the board an amount equal to the total of public funds received by such principal committee.\n4. No claim for the repayment of public funds shall be made against any candidate or committee without written notice to such candidate or committee, issued in a timely manner pursuant to all of the requirements of subdivision one of this section, and an opportunity to appear before the board. Any such repayment claim shall be based on a final determination issued by the board following an adjudication before the board consistent with the procedures set forth in section 1046 of the charter unless such procedures are waived by the candidate or principal committee. Such final determination shall be included in and made part of the final audit which shall be issued within thirty days of such determination.\n§ 3-710.5 Findings of violation; infraction; adjudications; or final determinations. (i) The board shall determine whether a [participating, or limited participating] qualified or non-participating candidate, his or her principal committee, authorized committee, committee treasurer or any other agent of such candidate has committed a violation or infraction of any provision of this chapter or the rules promulgated hereunder, for which the board may assess a civil penalty pursuant to section 3-711 of this chapter. The board shall promulgate rules defining infractions, and such definitions shall include, but not be limited to, failures to comply with the provisions of this chapter or the rules promulgated hereunder that are limited and non-repetitive.\n(ii) The board shall give written notice and the opportunity to appear before the board to any [participating, or limited participating] qualified or non-participating candidate, his or her principal committee, authorized committee, committee treasurer or any other agent of such candidate, if the board has reason to believe that such has committed a violation or infraction, before assessing any penalty for such action. Any such written notice of alleged violations shall be issued in a timely manner pursuant to all of the requirements of subdivision one of section 3-710 and shall precede the issuance of the final audit required pursuant to subdivision one of section 3-710. In the case of a written notice issued prior to the date of a covered election, or after the date of a covered election in the case of a notice regarding an alleged failure to respond to a request for audit documentation, such notice may be issued prior to the issuance of a draft audit. Alleged violations and proposed penalties shall be subject to resolution by adjudication before the board consistent with the procedures of section 1046 of the charter, unless such procedures are waived by the candidate or principal committee; provided, however, that in the case of adjudications conducted prior to the date of a covered election, the board shall use the procedures of section 1046 of the charter only to the extent practicable, given the expedited nature of such pre-election adjudications.

Declaration of legislative findings and intent.\\par\nThe city council finds and declares that the current system of privately financed campaigns diminishes the meaning of the right to vote by allowing large contributions to have a deleterious influence on the political process. The current system also violates the rights of all citizens to equal and meaningful participation in the democratic or political process. It diminishes the free-speech rights of non-wealthy voters and candidates whose voices are muffled by those who can afford to monopolize political communications. Additionally, the current system fuels the public perception of conflicts of interest and the domination of special money interests. That perception undermines the electorate\\rquote s confidence in the democratic process. It also makes it very difficult for qualified candidates without access to large contributors or personal fortunes to mount competitive campaigns. Because it places challengers at a distinct disadvantage, the system inhibits the free exchange of ideas and communication with the electorate.\\par\nThe city council finds and declares that providing a voluntary clean elections campaign finance system would enhance democracy. It would help eliminate the deleterious influence of large contributions on the political process, remove access to wealth as a major determinant of a citizen\\rquote s influence within the political process, and restore the meaning of the principle of \"one person, one vote.\" It would also help restore the rights of all citizens to equal and meaningful participation in the democratic process.\\par\nInstituting a public financing program would restore the free-speech rights of non-wealthy candidates and voters by providing candidates with resources with which to communicate ideas with the electorate. Such a system would thus help enhance the First Amendment rights of the electorate and candidates to be heard in the political process. It would help restore the core First Amendment value of open and robust debate in the political process. It would also diminish the electorate\\rquote s perception of domination of special interests and strengthen the public\\rquote s confidence in the democratic process and institutions. By providing for public financing, this act also addresses the genuine concern about the amount of time and effort that a candidate must devote to raising campaign funds.\\par\nSection 2.
