  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\nSection 1. Legislative findings and intent.  The number of general vending licenses is unchanged since 1979, when it was capped at 853.  It is estimated that over 1,000 general vending applicants are on a waiting list for licenses.  The waiting list was closed several years ago and it is likely that many more people would add their name to the list if possible.  The Council finds that legal vendors are far easier to regulate than illegal vendors and that vendors are a valuable part of the city’s economy.  Additionally, the current cap of 853 licenses is grossly outdated, having been set nearly thirty years ago.   For this reason, the Council finds that the number of available general vendor licenses should be increased by 20% to a total of one thousand-twenty three.  \n§2.  Subdivision a of section 20-459 of the administrative code of the city of New York is REPEALED and a new section a is added to read as follows: \na.  The number of licenses in effect at any time pursuant to this subchapter shall not exceed one-thousand-twenty-three (1023).  \n§3.
