At least one member appointed by the mayor and one member appointed by the comptroller shall not hold any other public office or public employment. The remaining members shall not be prohibited from holding any other public office or employment provided that no member may have substantial authority for the procurement of goods, services or construction pursuant to this chapter. The mayor shall designate the chair.\nb.
