  "Summary": "",
  "TextID": 31404,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection 1.  Declaration of Legislative Intent and Findings.\n\n\tThe New York City Campaign Finance Act, adopted by the New York City Council in 1988, has succeeded in enhancing competition for elective municipal offices, limiting campaign contributions and expenditures to reasonable levels, and vastly increasing public information about the sources and uses of campaign funds.\nThe Council finds that amendments to the New York City Campaign Finance Act, section 3-801 of the administrative code of the City of New York, and the charter of the City of New York, will further the goals of this landmark legislation.  \nThis local law will alter the formula for paying public funds to participating candidates facing high spending non-participating candidates, thus further reducing disparities between participating and non-participating candidates.  Additionally, this local law includes new provisions aimed at reducing expenditures of public funds in non-competitive races.  \n\tFurther, the Council seeks to permit those candidates for municipal office who fund their campaigns entirely through the use of their personal funds to participate in the Campaign Finance Program to a limited degree, without extending the public financing provisions to these candidates.  In doing so, the Council seeks to strengthen the City’s campaign finance program by enabling self-funded candidates to participate in the program by limiting their expenditures, in return for which the bonus provisions of the law will not be triggered for participating candidates, thus reducing Program costs.\n\tFurther, the Council finds that matching individual vendor contributions with public funds may lead to abuses in the Program or the perception of abuses in the Program.  Accordingly, the Council intends to disallow the matching of individual vendor contributions, but not contributions made from individuals working for a campaign or working for vendor companies.\n\tFurther, the Council intends to extend the prohibition on public servants sending mass mailings before an election from thirty to ninety days.  Within such ninety-day period, public servants may send one such mass mailing following the adoption of the city budget to inform constituents of the details of such budget and other government matters.\n\tFinally, the local law will improve key elements of the Debate Program.  Since its inception in 1997, the Debate Program has provided voters with valuable public exposure to candidates for citywide office.  The Council now seeks to amend the Debate Program based on its experience with two sets of debates - 1997 and 2001. These Debate Program changes will improve the functioning of debates, ease the process of selecting debate sponsors, and enhance the value of the Debate Program for City voters.\n\n\t§2.  Subdivisions 2, 3 and 12 of section 3-702 of the administrative code of the city of New York are amended and a new subdivision 13 is added to such section, to read as follows:\n\t2.  The term \"principal committee\" shall mean the authorized committee designated by a candidate pursuant to paragraph (e) of subdivision 1 of section 3-703 or  paragraph (a) of subdivision one of section 3-718 of this chapter.\n3.  The term \"matchable contribution\" shall mean (i) a con­tribution, (ii) contributions or (iii) a portion of a con­tribution or contributions, not greater than the applicable contribution limitation set forth in paragraph (f) of subdivision one of section 3-703 for all covered elections held in the same calendar year, made by a natural person resident in the city of New York to a participating candidate  which has been reported in full to the campaign finance board in accordance with subdivision six of section 3-703 by the candidate's principal committee and has been con­tributed on or before December thirty-first in the year of such election that may be matched by public funds in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.  [Matchable contributions comprised of up to one thousand dollars per contributor (or up to five hundred dollars per contributor in a special election to fill a vacancy) may be counted toward the threshold for eligibility of paragraph (a) of subdivision two of section 3-703.]  Any contribution, contributions, or a portion of a contribution determined to be invalid for matching funds by the board may not be treated as a matchable contribution for any purpose.  A loan may not be treated as a matchable contribution.

If a participating or limited participating candidate demonstrates to the board that a political committee has not accepted contributions, loans, or other receipts or made expenditures or transfers in a covered election, and represents that such committee will not accept contributions, loans, or other receipts or make expenditures or transfers in a covered election, the participating or limited participating candidate may submit to the board legible copies of financial disclosure reports, required to be filed with the city or state board of elections, for such committees in lieu of the disclosure report form designated by the board for purposes of subdivision six of this section.   \n9.  No political committee authorized by a participating or limited participating candidate for a covered election may be authorized to aid or take part in the elections of more than one candidate.\n10.  All receipts accepted by a principal committee shall be deposited in an account of the principal committee.  The treasurer of the principal committee shall be responsible for making such deposits.

Each disclosure report filed pursuant to subdivision six of this section shall include the date of receipt of each contribution accepted. \n11.  Regardless whether a participating candidate demonstrates eligibility for optional public financing under this chapter, a participating candidate and his or her principal committee are nonetheless required to abide by the requirements of paragraphs (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (k) and (l) of subdivision one of this section.\n12. (a)  Each participating candidate or limited participating candidate for nomination for election, or election, or the principal committee of such candidate, shall submit, in a contemporaneous manner, the disclosure reports required pursuant to this chapter, filed in accordance with the schedule specified by the state board of elections for the filing of campaign receipt and expenditure statements, and such other disclosure reports as the rules of the board may require, in order for any contributions received during the periods covered by such reports and prior to the last date upon which such candidate may file a certification pursuant to paragraph (c) of subdivision one of this section to qualify as matchable contributions.\n(b)  The board shall review each disclosure report timely submitted by a candidate prior to the last date upon which such candidate may file a certification pursuant to paragraph (c) of subdivision one of this section, or subdivision one of section 3-718, and issue to the candidate a review before the next disclosure report is due.  Such review shall inform the candidate of relevant questions the board has concerning the candidate’s: (i) compliance with requirements of this chapter and of the rules issued by the board; and (ii) qualification for receiving public funds pursuant to this chapter.  In the course of this review, the board shall give candidates an opportunity to respond to and correct potential violations, before the deadline for filing a certification pursuant to paragraph (c) of subdivision one of this section, or subdivision one of section 3-718, and give candidates an opportunity to address questions the board has concerning their matchable contribution claims or other issues concerning eligibility for receiving public funds pursuant to this chapter; provided, however, this paragraph shall not apply to the last required disclosure report before the deadline for filing a certification pursuant to paragraph (c) of subdivision one of this section or subdivision one of section 3-718.  Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude the board from subsequently reviewing such disclosure reports and taking any action otherwise authorized under this chapter.\n\t13.

These expenditures shall, at a minimum, include all expenditures made by the political committee making the transfer during the election cycle of the covered election.  The board shall issue instructions defining the circumstances in which such disclosure reports shall also include additional expenditures made by other political committees authorized by the participating candidate that originally received such contributions and additional expenditures made prior to such election cycle.  Such expenditures shall be applied to the expenditure limit applicable under 3-706.\n(c) Participating candidates shall have the burden of demonstrating that expenditures reported pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subdivision are not subject to the expenditure limit applicable under section 3-706 and are not a basis for reducing public funds payments pursuant to subdivision eight of section 3-705 of this chapter.\n(d)  Nothing in this subdivision is intended to modify or supersede any federal law that prohibits or otherwise restricts the use of campaign or donated funds by political committees, candidates or federal officeholders.\n\n\t§5.

Written applications by organizations to sponsor [an election] a debate shall be submitted to the campaign finance board on a form provided by the board not later than a date chosen by the board in any year in which an election is held for city-wide offices.  \n\t(a)  The written application shall:\n\t(i)  demonstrate that the organization and any proposed co-sponsor meet the criteria of  subdivision four of this section;\n\t(ii)  specify the election and office for which the organization seeks to sponsor the debate;\n\t(iii)  set forth the date, time, duration, and location of the debate and the specific and exclusive circumstances under which the date or time may be changed, together with a provision for when the rescheduled debate would be held;\n\t(iv)  provide a detailed description of the format and ground rules for the debate;\n\t (v)  verify that the staging, promotion, and coverage of the debate shall be in conformance with all applicable laws;\n\t (vi)  include an agreement to indemnify the city for any liability arising from the acts or omissions of the sponsor; and \n(vii) set forth plans for publicity and for broadcast and other media coverage for the debate[.]; and\n(viii)  set forth the criteria for determining which candidates are eligible to participate in each debate the organization seeks to sponsor, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this subdivision.\n\t(b)  (i)  Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (ii) below, each debate for a primary, general or special election shall include only those participating candidates or limited participating candidates the sponsor of each such debate has determined meet the non-partisan, objective, and non-discriminatory criteria set forth in any agreement between the sponsor and the board; provided, however, that the criteria for the first debate for a primary, general, or special election shall provide, among other criteria, (A) that a participating candidate shall be eligible to participate in such debate if he or she has, by the last filing date prior to such debate, either (I) spent, contracted, or obligated to spend, or (II) received in contributions, an amount equal to or more than twenty percent of the threshold for eligibility for public funding applicable to participating candidates contained in subdivision two of section 3-703, and (B) that a limited participating candidate shall be eligible to participate in such debate if he or she has, by the last filing date prior to such debate, spent, contracted, or obligated to spend, an amount equal to or more than twenty percent of the threshold for eligibility for public funding applicable to participating candidates seeking the office for which such debate is being held contained in subdivision two of section 3-703; provided, further, that the second debate for a primary, general, or special election shall include only those participating candidates or limited participating candidates who the sponsor has also determined are leading contenders on the basis of additional non-partisan, objective, and non-discriminatory criteria set forth in any agreement between the sponsor and the board.  Nothing in this provision is intended to limit the debates to the two major political parties.\n[The second debate for a general election shall include only those candidates who the sponsor has determined are the leading contenders for the office on the basis of the objective, non-partisan, and non-discriminatory criteria.  These criteria must be set forth in the sponsor's written application.]\n\t(ii)  If [the] a debate sponsor [of the second general election debate] has determined that a non-participating candidate [who is not a participating candidate is a leading contender for the office on the basis of such criteria] has met all the non-partisan, objective, and non-discriminatory criteria applicable to participating candidates or limited participating candidates for access to any of the primary, general, or special election debates, the sponsor may invite that candidate to participate in [the] such debate.  In the case of a [runoff] run-off primary election or a run-off special election, the sponsor may invite a non-participating candidate to participate in [the debate(s)] such debate. However, if a non-participating candidate [non-participant leading contender] does not accept such invitation to debate or does not appear at such debate, the debate shall go forward as scheduled [with the other previously selected leading contender or contenders in the case of a second general election debate or participating candidate on the ballot in the case of a runoff election debate]; provided, however, if there is only one participating candidate or limited participating candidate participating in any such debate, upon agreement by the debate sponsor, the board and the potential debater, such debate may be canceled.\n\t[(c)  In the case of the second general election debate, the application shall also provide for an alternative non-partisan voter education program that the sponsor shall provide for any participating candidates not deemed leading contenders.]\n6.  Prior to choosing a sponsor, the board shall provide for the receipt of comments from interested persons regarding the qualifications of potential sponsors.  The [Board] board shall consider and give substantial weight to such comments submitted by candidates.\n7.  Based upon the criteria in subdivision [4] four above and any comments received pursuant to subdivision [6] six above, the board shall select the organization or organizations to sponsor the [election] debates and shall provide written notification to the organization or organizations so selected.   In addition to the sufficiency of the application, the board shall consider the applicant’s ability to reach a wide audience and present a fair and impartial debate.  The board may accept an application subject to modifications as it deems appropriate and as are acceptable to the sponsor.\n\t8.  For [the two primary] all debates [and the first general election debate], the board shall provide each debate sponsor it has selected with a list of [candidates] participating candidates and limited participating candidates who are [required] eligible to be considered to participate in such debates.\n\t9.  If a candidate fails to participate in any debate required under this section before an election, the candidate shall be liable for return of [moneys] any public matching funds previously received [for use by the candidate to pay election campaign expenses and] pursuant to the certification filed by the candidate in connection with the election for which such debate is held, shall be ineligible to receive any further matching funds for that election, and may be subject to a civil penalty pursuant to section 3-711.  For purposes of this subdivision, each primary, general, special or [run off] run-off election shall be considered a separate election.\n\t10.  Following the submission of a petition on behalf of the candidate and a hearing before the board, the [penalty] sanction or sanctions provided in subdivision nine of this section applicable to a [participating] candidate for failure to participate in any debate as required under this section [shall] may be waived upon a determination by the board that the failure to participate in the debate occurred under circumstances beyond the control of the candidate and of such nature that a reasonable person would find the failure justifiable or excusable.\n\t11.  Nothing contained in this section shall preclude any candidate from agreeing to participate in any number of additional debates between any and all candidates for a city-wide office, including [those candidates not participating in the campaign finance program] non-participating candidates or limited participating candidates. These debates need not be held under guidelines or the purview of the campaign finance board.\n\n\t§9.

Declaration of Legislative Intent and Findings.\\par\n\\par\n\\pard\\sl480\\slmult1\\tab The New York City Campaign Finance Act, adopted by the New York City Council in 1988, has succeeded in enhancing competition for elective municipal offices, limiting campaign contributions and expenditures to reasonable levels, and vastly increasing public information about the sources and uses of campaign funds.\\par\n\\pard\\fi720\\sl480\\slmult1 The Council finds that amendments to the New York City Campaign Finance Act, section 3-801 of the administrative code of the City of New York, and the charter of the City of New York, will further the goals of this landmark legislation.  \\par\nThis local law will alter the formula for paying public funds to participating candidates facing high spending non-participating candidates, thus further reducing disparities between participating and non-participating candidates.  Additionally, this local law includes new provisions aimed at reducing expenditures of public funds in non-competitive races.  \\par\n\\pard\\sl480\\slmult1\\tab Further, the Council seeks to permit those candidates for municipal office who fund their campaigns entirely through the use of their personal funds to participate in the Campaign Finance Program to a limited degree, without extending the public financing provisions to these candidates.  In doing so, the Council seeks to strengthen the City\\rquote s campaign finance program by enabling self-funded candidates to participate in the program by limiting their expenditures, in return for which the bonus provisions of the law will not be triggered for participating candidates, thus reducing Program costs.\\par\n\\tab Further, the Council finds that matching individual vendor contributions with public funds may lead to abuses in the Program or the perception of abuses in the Program.  Accordingly, the Council intends to disallow the matching of individual vendor contributions, but not contributions made from individuals working for a campaign or working for vendor companies.\\par\n\\tab Further, the Council intends to extend the prohibition on public servants sending mass mailings before an election from thirty to ninety days.  Within such ninety-day period, public servants may send one such mass mailing following the adoption of the city budget to inform constituents of the details of such budget and other government matters.\\ul\\b\\par\n\\ulnone\\b0\\tab Finally, the local law will improve key elements of the Debate Program.  Since its inception in 1997, the Debate Program has provided voters with valuable public exposure to candidates for citywide office.  The Council now seeks to amend the Debate Program based on its experience with two sets of debates - 1997 and 2001. These Debate Program changes will improve the functioning of debates, ease the process of selecting debate sponsors, and enhance the value of the Debate Program for City voters.\\par\n\\ul\\par\n\\ulnone\\tab\\'a72.
