  "TextID": 35086,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\nSection 1. Statement of findings and purpose.  Home electricity and gas expenses represent a substantial cost for many low-income New Yorkers in rental apartments.  For example, nationally in 1997, households in multi-family buildings spent an average of $848 per year on energy.  In addition, since much of New York City’s electricity is produced within the City, energy consumption translates directly into greater local pollution, including emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, carbon dioxide and mercury. These pollutants contribute to respiratory disease, heart disease, smog, acid rain and climate change.  Moreover, as energy demand rises, so does our reliance on dirty, inefficient power plants and the City and nation’s dependence on foreign oil and natural gas.\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy certify a wide range of household appliances and building materials as energy efficient through the ENERGY STAR program, including refrigerators, room air conditioners, dishwashers, clothes washers and windows.  For example, ENERGY STAR qualified dishwashers use 25% less energy than the federal minimum standard for energy consumption.  ENERGY STAR certified products are widely available and generally have little or no cost premium compared with uncertified products.  Even when Energy Star products are more expensive than conventional options, these products more than pay for the increased price over time through reduced energy costs.\nWhen people buy appliances for their own homes, they have an incentive to ensure that the appliances use the least energy possible because homeowners pay for their energy costs.  When landlords or developers, however, purchase appliances, they do not have the same incentive.  Since it is tenants or future owners who generally pay for energy costs, the primary financial concern for landlords and developers is to limit the up-front costs of appliances, without regard for energy consumption.\nThe Council finds that the increased use of ENERGY STAR certified appliances for apartments in New York City will substantially reduce household energy costs as well as the City’s electricity consumption and air pollution.  Accordingly, the Council declares that it is reasonable and necessary to require those who receive certain tax benefits from the City to purchase Energy Star certified appliances when they replace appliances in rental apartments.\n§2.

Statement of findings and purpose.  Home electricity and gas expenses represent a substantial cost for many low-income New Yorkers in rental apartments.  For example, nationally in 1997, households in multi-family buildings spent an average of $848 per year on energy.  In addition, since much of New York City\\rquote s electricity is produced within the City, energy consumption translates directly into greater local pollution, including emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, carbon dioxide and mercury. These pollutants contribute to respiratory disease, heart disease, smog, acid rain and climate change.  Moreover, as energy demand rises, so does our reliance on dirty, inefficient power plants and the City and nation\\rquote s dependence on foreign oil and natural gas.\\par\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy certify a wide range of household appliances and building materials as energy efficient through the ENERGY STAR program, including refrigerators, room air conditioners, dishwashers, clothes washers and windows.  For example, ENERGY STAR qualified dishwashers use 25% less energy than the federal minimum standard for energy consumption.  ENERGY STAR certified products are widely available and generally have little or no cost premium compared with uncertified products.  Even when Energy Star products are more expensive than conventional options, these products more than pay for the increased price over time through reduced energy costs.\\par\nWhen people buy appliances for their own homes, they have an incentive to ensure that the appliances use the least energy possible because homeowners pay for their energy costs.  When landlords or developers, however, purchase appliances, they do not have the same incentive.  Since it is tenants or future owners who generally pay for energy costs, the primary financial concern for landlords and developers is to limit the up-front costs of appliances, without regard for energy consumption.\\par\nThe Council finds that the increased use of ENERGY STAR certified appliances for apartments in New York City will substantially reduce household energy costs as well as the City\\rquote s electricity consumption and air pollution.  Accordingly, the Council declares that it is reasonable and necessary to require those who receive certain tax benefits from the City to purchase Energy Star certified appliances when they replace appliances in rental apartments.\\par\n\\'a72.\\expndtw-3  The administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 11-245.8 to part 1 of subchapter 2 of chapter 2 of title 21 to read as follows:\\par\n\\ul\\'a711-245.8 \\expndtw0 ENERGY STAR a\\expndtw-3 ppliances. a.
