Such estimate shall be signed by both the mayor and the speaker of the council and shall be submitted to the council by the mayor no later than the fourth day of June.  If, by the fourth day of June, the mayor and the council are unable to agree upon a single estimate of revenues for the ensuing fiscal year, the mayor and the council shall submit their respective estimates to the comptroller on such date.
