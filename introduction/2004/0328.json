Legislative Findings.  The Council finds that individuals and their personal property are, or can be, unwittingly exposed to pesticides applied on their neighbor\\rquote s property.  The Council further finds that pesticides may pose health and safety risks to people, particularly children, pregnant women, the elderly and people with infirmities.  Such potential risks include short-term impacts, such as headaches, nausea, seizures and respiratory problems, and long-term impacts, such as neurological damage, hormone disruption, reproductive disorders and various cancers.  The intent of this local law is to provide information to City residents about certain pesticide applications to which they may be exposed, so that they can take steps to minimize such exposure to themselves, their families, pets, backyard wildlife and property.  \\par\nAccordingly, this Council adopts the special notice requirements for commercial and residential applications of pesticides as set forth in Section 33-1004 of the New York Environmental Conservation Law.  It is intended that this local law be read and applied consistently with that section and all other applicable provisions of the Environmental Conservation Law and regulations promulgated thereunder.\\par\n\\'a7 2.
