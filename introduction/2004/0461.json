  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\nSection One.  Legislative Intent and Findings.  It is hereby declared and found that the sale of sharpened samurai swords is a menace to the public health, peace, safety, and welfare of the people of the city of New York.  Easy access to such swords facilitates criminal and illegal behavior; the dire consequences of the use of such swords was reflected in a June 13, 2004 incident, when a Queens teen murdered his friend with a three foot long sharpened samurai sword in a dispute over a pillow.  The Council finds that unless the sale of such swords is prohibited, there is danger of an increase in crimes of violence and other conditions detrimental to public peace, safety, and welfare.\n§ 2. Chapter one of title 10 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to add a new section 10-133.1, to read as follows:\n§ 10-133.1.
