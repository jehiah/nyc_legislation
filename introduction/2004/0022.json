  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows: \n\n\tSection 1.  The purpose of this local law, which shall be known as the \"Local Civil Rights Restoration Act of 2005,\" is to clarify the scope of New York City’s Human Rights Law.  It is the sense of the Council that New York City’s Human Rights Law has been construed too narrowly to ensure protection of the civil rights of all persons covered by the law.  In particular, through passage of this local law, the Council seeks to underscore that the provisions of New York City’s Human Rights Law are to be construed independently from similar or identical provisions of New York state or federal statutes. Interpretations of New York state or federal statutes with similar wording may be used to aid in interpretation of the New York City Human Rights Law, viewing similarly worded provisions of federal and state civil rights laws as a floor below which the City’s Human Rights law cannot fall, rather than a ceiling above which the local law cannot rise.  \n\t\t§ 2.  Section 8-102 of chapter one of title eight of the administrative code of the City of New York is amended as follows: \n\t\t24.  The term \"partnership status\" means the status of being in a domestic partnership, as   defined by  § 3-240(a) of the administrative code of the city of New York.\n\t§ 3.  Subdivisions 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9 and 18 of section 8-107 of chapter one of title eight of the administrative code of the City of New York are amended to read as follows: \n1. Employment.

In any civil action commenced pursuant to this section, the court, in its discretion, may award the prevailing party costs and reasonable attorney's fees.  For the purposes of this subdivision, the term \"prevailing\" includes a plaintiff whose commencement of litigation has acted as a catalyst to effect policy change on the part of the defendant, regardless of whether that change has been implemented voluntarily, as a result of a settlement or as a result of a judgment in such plaintiff’s favor.\n\t\t§ 9.

Section 8-603 of chapter five of title eight of the administrative code of the City of New York is amended as follows:  \n§  8-603 Discriminatory harassment; civil penalties. \na. No person shall by force or threat of force, knowingly injure, intimidate or interfere with, oppress, or threaten any other person in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him or her by the constitution or laws of this state or by the constitution or laws of the United States or by local law of the city when such injury, intimidation, interference, oppression or threat is motivated in whole or in part by the victim's actual or perceived race, creed, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, partnership status, disability or alienage or citizenship status, as defined in chapter one of this title.\nb. No person shall knowingly deface, damage or destroy the real or personal property of any person for the purpose of intimidating or interfering with the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to the other person by the constitution or laws of this state or by the constitution or laws of the United States or by local law of the city when such defacement, damage or destruction of real or personal property is motivated in whole or in part by the victim's actual or perceived race, creed, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, partnership status, or whether children are, may be, or would be residing with such victim, disability or alienage or citizenship status, as defined in chapter one of this title.\n\t\tc. Any person who violates subdivision a or b of this section shall be liable for a civil penalty of not more than one hundred thousand dollars for each violation, which may be recovered by the corporation counsel in an action or proceeding in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n§ 11.  Section 8-701 of chapter five of title eight of the administrative code of the City of New York is amended as follows:  \n§  8-701 Legislative declaration.\n \n\t\tBoycotts or blacklists that are based on a person's race, color, creed, age, national origin, alienage or citizenship status, marital status, partnership status, gender, sexual orientation, or disability pose a menace to the city's foundation and institutions. In contrast to protests that are in reaction to an unlawful discriminatory practice, connected with a labor dispute or associated with other speech or activities that are protected by the first amendment discriminatory boycotts cause havoc, divide the citizenry and do not serve a legitimate purpose. The council declares that discriminatory boycotts are a dangerously insidious form of prejudice and hereby establishes a procedure for expeditiously investigating allegations of this type of prejudice, assuring that the council and mayor are duly alerted to the existence of such activity and combating discriminatory boycotts or blacklists.\n§ 12.  This local law shall take effect upon enactment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8/16/2005 · 3:34 PM",
