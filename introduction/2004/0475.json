  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\nSection 1.  Legislative intent.\tThe city of New York has an obligation to protect the safety and well being of its children, who are among its most vulnerable residents.  This includes the regulation of child day care services regulated by the city of New York and not otherwise regulated by the state of New York, which provide care for children while their parents are at work.  The Council recognizes an ever-increasing demand for day care services to help maintain the financial security of families.  The Council finds, however, that parents often do not have access to complete, accurate information they need to make informed decisions when they select child care facilities for their children.  The purpose of this local law is to ensure that parents have access to critical information they need to make informed decisions regarding their children’s care and to improve the quality of day care throughout New York City.    \n§ 2.
