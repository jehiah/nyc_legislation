  "Summary": "",
  "TextID": 31405,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection 1.  Declaration of Legislative Intent and Findings.\n\n\tThe New York City Campaign Finance Act, adopted by the New York City Council in 1988, has succeeded in enhancing competition for elective municipal offices, limiting campaign contributions and expenditures to reasonable levels, and vastly increasing public information about the sources and uses of campaign funds.\nThe Council finds that amendments to the New York City Campaign Finance Act and the charter of the City of New York, will further the goals of this landmark legislation.  By imposing the same contribution provisions of the Campaign Finance Act to those candidates for municipal office who elect not to participate in the Campaign Finance Program, without extending to such candidates the public financing provisions or the provisions limiting expenditures, the Council seeks to further strengthen the reform program that has been recognized as a national model.  By ending the disparity in contribution limits faced by participating candidates opposed by non-participating candidates, these amendments further reduce the opportunity for wealthy special interests to exercise or appear to exercise undue influence over local elected officials in New York City.  \n\tThis local law will also extend the existing ban on contributions from corporations to non-participating candidates, thus eliminating further disparities between participating and non-participating candidates and promoting a governmental interest in emphasizing contributions from individuals.  \n\n\t§2.  Subdivision 8 of section 3-702 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended and new subdivisions 13 and 14 are added to such section to read as follows:\n8.  The term \"contribution\" shall mean:  (a) any gift, sub­scription, advance, or deposit of money or any thing of value, made in connection with the nomination for election, or election, of any candidate; (b) any funds received by a political committee from another political committee to the extent such funds do not con­stitute a transfer; (c) any payment, by any person other than a candidate or a political committee authorized by the candidate, made in connection with the nomination for election, or election, of any candidate, including but not limited to compensation for the personal services of any individual which are rendered in con­nection with a candidate's election or nomination without charge; provided however, that none of the foregoing shall be deemed a contribution if it is made, taken or performed by a person or a political committee independent of the candidate or his or her agents or political committees authorized by such candidate pursuant to section 14-112 of the New York state election law.  For purposes of this subdivision, the term \"independent of the candidate or his or her agents or political committees authorized by such candidate pur­suant to section 14-112 of the New York state election law\" shall mean that the candidate or his or her agents or political committees so authorized by such candidate did not authorize, request, suggest, foster or cooperate in any such activity; and provided further, that the term \"con­tribution\" shall not include:\n(i)\tthe value of services provided without compensation by individuals who volunteer a portion or all of their time on behalf of a candidate or political committee,\n(ii)\tthe use of real or personal property and the cost of invitations, food and beverages voluntarily provided by an in­dividual to a candidate or political committee on the individ­ual's residential premises for candidate-related activities to the extent such services do not exceed five hundred dollars in value, and  \n(iii)\tthe travel expenses of any individual who on his or her own behalf volunteers his or her personal services to any candidate or political committee to the extent such expenses are unreimbursed and do not exceed five hundred dollars in value.\nA loan made to a participating candidate or his or her principal committee, or a non-participating candidate or his or her authorized committees other than in the regular course of the lend­er's business shall be deemed, to the extent not repaid by the date of the first covered election in which such [the participating] candidate is governed by this chapter [is a participant] following the date of the loan, a con­tribution by the lender.  A loan made to a participating candidate or his or her principal committee, or a non-participating candidate or his or her authorized committees in the regular course of the lender's business shall be deemed, to the extent not repaid by the date of the first covered election in which the [participating] candidate is governed by this chapter [a participant] following the date of the loan, a contribution by the obligor on the loan and by any other person endorsing, cosigning, guaranteeing, collateralizing or otherwise providing security for the loan.\n\t13. The term “limited participating candidate” shall mean a candidate who meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of subdivision one of section 3-718 of this chapter.\n14. The term “non-participating candidate” shall mean any candidate for nomination for election, or election, to the office of mayor, public advocate, comptroller, borough president or mem­ber of the city council who does not file a written certification pursuant to section 3-703 or meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of subdivision one of section 3-718 of this chapter, or who has, or the authorized committees of such candidate have, made expenditures in furtherance of the nomination for election or election to an office covered by this chapter.\n\n§3.  Paragraphs (f) and (l) of subdivision 1 of section 3-703 of the administrative code of the city of New York are amended to read as follows:\t\n(f)  not accept and his or her principal committee or authorized committees must not accept, either directly or by transfer, any contribution or contributions from any one individual­, partnership, political committee, employee organiza­tion or other entity for all covered elections held in the same calendar year in which he or she is a participating candidate or a non-participating candidate which in the aggregate: (i) for the office of mayor, public advocate or comptroller shall exceed four thousand five hundred dollars, or (ii) for borough president, shall exceed three thousand five hundred dollars, or (iii) for mem­ber of the city council, shall exceed two thousand five hundred dollars; provided that a participating candidate and his or her principal committee or a non-participating candidate and his or her authorized committees may accept additional contributions which do not exceed one half the amount of the applicable limitation for any run-off primary election, additional day for voting held pursuant to section 3-108 of the New York state election law, special election to fill a vacancy, run-off special election to fill a vacancy, delayed or otherwise postponed election, or election held pursuant to court order which is a covered election and in which the candidate seeks nomination for election or election; and provid­ed further that if state law prescribes a contribution limitation of a lesser amount, this paragraph shall not be deemed to authorize acceptance of a contribution in excess of such lesser amount.  The maximum contributions set forth in this paragraph shall be adjusted in accordance with subdivision seven of this section;\n(l)   not accept and his or her principal committee or authorized committees must not accept, either directly or by transfer, any contribution, loan, guarantee, or other security for such loan from any corporation, other than a corporation that is a political committee as defined in subdivision eleven of section 3-702 of this chapter, for all covered elections held in the same calendar year in which he or she is a participating or non-participating candidate;\n\n§4.  Subdivisions 9 and 10 of section 3-703 of the administrative code of the city of New York are amended to read as follows:\n9.  No political committee authorized by a participating, limited participating or non-participating candidate for a covered election may be authorized to aid or take part in the elections of more than one candidate.\n10.  All receipts accepted by a participating or limited participating candidate and his or her principal committee shall be deposited in an account of the principal committee.  All receipts accepted by a non-participating candidate and his or her authorized committees shall be deposited in an account of the authorized committees.  The treasurer of the principal committee or authorized committee shall be responsible for making such deposits.  All deposits shall be made within ten business days of receipt; provided, however, that deposits of contributions made in the form of checks received by a participating, limited participating or non-participating candidate [candidates] and his or her committees for the office of city council more than one year before the first covered election for which such candidate is seeking nomination or election may be made within twenty business days of receipt.  Each disclosure report filed pursuant to subdivision six of this section shall include the date of receipt of each contribution accepted.\n\n\t§5.  Subdivisions 3, 7, and 8 of section 3-708 of the administrative code of the city of New York are amended to read as follows:\n\t3.  The board may employ necessary staff, including an executive director and a counsel, and make necessary expenditures subject to appropriation.  The board may employ such staff, including legal and accounting staff, as are necessary for providing technical assistance to candidates and prospective [and participating] candidates in covered elections, for the purpose of promoting understanding of, participation in, and compliance with the requirements of the [campaign finance program created by] provisions of this chapter.\n\t7.

Declaration of Legislative Intent and Findings.\\par\n\\par\n\\pard\\sl480\\slmult1\\tab The New York City Campaign Finance Act, adopted by the New York City Council in 1988, has succeeded in enhancing competition for elective municipal offices, limiting campaign contributions and expenditures to reasonable levels, and vastly increasing public information about the sources and uses of campaign funds.\\par\n\\pard\\fi720\\sl480\\slmult1 The Council finds that amendments to the New York City Campaign Finance Act and the charter of the City of New York, will further the goals of this landmark legislation.  By imposing the same contribution provisions of the Campaign Finance Act to those candidates for municipal office who elect not to participate in the Campaign Finance Program, without extending to such candidates the public financing provisions or the provisions limiting expenditures, the Council seeks to further strengthen the reform program that has been recognized as a national model.  By ending the disparity in contribution limits faced by participating candidates opposed by non-participating candidates, these amendments further reduce the opportunity for wealthy special interests to exercise or appear to exercise undue influence over local elected officials in New York City.  \\par\n\\pard\\sl480\\slmult1\\tab This local law will also extend the existing ban on contributions from corporations to non-participating candidates, thus eliminating further disparities between participating and non-participating candidates and promoting a governmental interest in emphasizing contributions from individuals.  \\par\n\\ul\\par\n\\ulnone\\tab\\'a72.
