Legislative Intent and Findings.\nIn order to enhance the public safety, and ensure that school buses can be tracked from the air if they are lost or stolen, the City Council finds that operators of school buses should be required to place an identifying number unique to each bus on the roof of the bus.  By doing so, law enforcement will be in a better position to locate a school bus from the air, should the need arise.\n§2. Section 19-607 of the administrative code of the city of New York is renumbered as section 19-608, to read as follows:\n[§19-607] §19-608 Penalty.  Any person, firm or corporation who shall violate the provisions of this chapter shall be punished by a fine of five hundred dollars, or by imprisonment not to exceed three months or by both such fine and imprisonment.\n§3. Chapter six of title 19 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding thereto a new section 19-607 to read as follows:\n§19-607. Identifying Numbers. Every omnibus having a seating capacity of more than seven passengers, used to transport pupils, teachers and other persons acting in a supervisory capacity to and from school or school activities, must have an identifying number unique to that vehicle conspicuously lettered on the roof of the omnibus.\n§4. This local law shall take effect sixty days after its enactment into law.",
