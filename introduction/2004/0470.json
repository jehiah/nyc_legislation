  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\nSection 1. Declaration of legislative findings and intent. Although the police department gathers data about crime in parks, such information is not readily available to the council.  The police department reports to the council on the number of crimes within each precinct, including a subset of housing bureau and transit bureau complaints within each precinct, but information on crime in parks is not separately provided.\nParks provide an oasis for residents and visitors, and it is vitally important that just as precinct crime information is sent to the council on a quarterly basis, data about the safety of parks should also be provided to the council.\n§2. Paragraph 4 of subdivision a of section 14-150 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\n4. A crime status report. Such report shall include the total number of crime complaints (categorized by class of crime, indicating whether the crime is a misdemeanor or felony) for each patrol precinct, including a subset of housing bureau and transit bureau complaints within each precinct; arrests (categorized by class of crime, indicating whether the arrest is for a misdemeanor or felony) for each patrol precinct, housing police service area, transit district, street crime unit and narcotics division; summons activity (categorized by type of summons, indicating whether the summons is a parking violation, moving violation, environmental control board notice of violation, or criminal court summons) for each patrol precinct, housing police service area and transit district; domestic violence radio runs for each patrol precinct; average response time for critical and serious crimes in progress for each patrol precinct; overtime statistics for each patrol borough and operational bureau performing an enforcement function within the police department, including, but not limited to, each patrol precinct, housing police service area, transit district and patrol borough street crime unit, as well as the narcotics division, fugitive enforcement division and the special operations division, including its subdivisions, but shall not include internal investigative commands and shall not include undercover officers assigned to any command.
