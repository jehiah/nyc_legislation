  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\nSection 1.\tLegislative findings.  The Council of the city of New York affirms that voting is a central tenet of democracy.  The vitality of the democratic process depends on voter participation in elections.  Yet, far too few New Yorkers vote in local, state or national elections, and voter participation has been declining.  The Council finds that affirmative steps are necessary to encourage and increase voter participation in all elections.\nThe Council further finds that this decline and lack of participation is due, in part, to the fact that voters find it difficult to register to vote.  Although both city and state laws provide mechanisms for distributing voter registration forms by city and state agencies as part of agency-based voter registration programs, the New York City Department of Education does not participate in such programs.  The Council finds that the Department of Education is uniquely positioned in the City to enhance the participation of young people in the democratic process by distributing voter registration forms to potential young voters.\n§ 2.\tSection 3-209 of the administrative code of the city of New York is hereby REPEALED and RE-ENACTED as follows:\n§ 3-209\ta.
