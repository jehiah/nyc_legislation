Legislative Intent and Findings.\n\n\tRecently, a private corporation brought to market a device designed to combine oxygen with liquid alcohol to create alcohol in vapor form.  Said vapor may then be consumed through inhalation, causing the user to experience the traditional effects of intoxication, including mild euphoria and motor impairment. \n\tAlthough its long-term physical dangers cannot be determined due to the device’s novelty, it is widely agreed by health experts that this particular method of introducing alcohol into the body poses significant health risks.  As the resulting mist is inhaled, the vapor bypasses the stomach and liver, normally serving to filter alcohol from the bloodstream, and delivers a high concentration of alcohol to the brain. \nThe significant danger that directly exposing the brain to alcohol may potentially lead to permanent nerve damage, particularly after prolonged use, warrants prohibition of the device.\n§2.  Chapter 1 of title 10 of the administrative code of the city of New York is \namended to add a new section 10-162, to read as follows:\n\n§10-162.  Devices Permitting Inhalation of Vaporized Alcohol.\n\nIt shall be unlawful for any person to manufacture, sell or offer for sale, possess or use, or attempt to use, any device, machine, apparatus or instrument of any kind designed to convert any alcoholic beverage or product containing alcohol, either solely or combined with any other substance, into a gaseous or vaporous form to be subsequently discharged, emitted or released for consumption by inhalation. \n§3.  This local law shall become effective immediately.",
