  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\nSection 1.  Legislative Intent and Findings\nThe City Council hereby finds and declares that it is the right of every person who attends New York City public schools to have the opportunity to learn and teach in an environment free from intimidation and physical harm. Crime in public schools, though lower in recent years, is still too high. \nTo foster an atmosphere free of violence, security cameras have been installed in traditional public fora, such as public parks, streets and housing facilities.  These cameras provide law enforcement with additional eyes and ears and have greatly assisted in reducing crime in areas where they are placed. Additionally, it is cost-effective to have a security device in conjunction with live school security agents.\nIt is not the intent of this local law to interfere with the exercise of the constitutionally protected rights of freedom of expression and association, nor to infringe on students’ right to privacy.  This legislation therefore expresses the intent that cameras be placed at entrance and exit doors, and at other sites within schools and consolidated school locations where individuals do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy.\n§ 2. Chapter 20 of the charter of the city of New York is amended by adding the following new section 528:\n§528. The installation and operation of security cameras in New York City public schools.\na. Installation of Security Cameras. The New York City department of education, in consultation with the New York City police department, shall install security cameras at schools and consolidated school locations operated by the department of education where the chancellor, in consultation with the New York City police department, deems such cameras appropriate for safety purposes.  Such cameras may be placed at the entrance and exit doors of each school and may be placed in any area of the school where individuals do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy.  The number, type, placement, and location of such cameras within each school shall be at the discretion of the department of education, in consultation with the principal of each school and the police department. \nSchedule of Installation. The department of education, in consultation with the police \ndepartment, shall set the priorities for installation of cameras as set forth in subdivision a to include among other appropriate factors consideration of the level of violence in schools, as determined by the police department and the department of education.  By the end of 2006, the potential installation of cameras shall have been reviewed for all schools under the jurisdiction of the department of education, including elementary schools.  At the end of 2006, the department of education shall submit a report to the city council indicating, for each school under its jurisdiction, the findings of the review and the reasons for the findings contained therein.  \n \t§3. This local law shall take effect 90 days after its enactment.",
