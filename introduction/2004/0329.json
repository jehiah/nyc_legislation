Every city contract to perform work or provide labor or services related to property owned or leased by the city shall contain the following provision:  “To the extent that you apply pesticides to any property owned or leased by the city, you, or any subcontractor you hire, shall comply with chapter 12 of the administrative code.”    \nb. Upon receiving information that a contractor is in violation of this chapter, the city agency holding the contract shall review such information and offer the contractor an opportunity to respond.  If such city agency finds that a violation has occurred, it shall take such action as may be appropriate and provided for by law, rule or contract, including, but not limited to, imposing sanctions, seeking compliance, recovering damages, and/or declaring the contractor in default.\n§ 17-1210  Rules.  The commissioner shall promulgate any rules as may be necessary for the purposes of carrying out the provisions of this chapter.\n§ 2.
