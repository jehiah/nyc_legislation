In addition, a diagram or plan of each tier in the auditorium, showing clearly and distinctly all aisles, exits and total number of seats on each tier, shall be posted in the office of the premises or in the program of the performance in any space classified as a F-1A occupancy under the building code such diagram may be printed in black lines, occupying a space on the program of ten square inches or more.\n(b) An audible announcement shall be made not more than 10 minutes prior to the start of any performance or program to notify the occupants of the locations of exits to be used in the event of a fire or other emergency; provided, however, that in any theatre the announcement may be projected upon a screen or other surface approved by the commissioner in a manner approved by the commissioner.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the discretion of the commissioner, upon application any place of assembly in which at least one exit is clearly visible from every seat or standing area where people are authorized to view or participate in any performance or activity may be exempted from the requirements of this subdivision.\n§ 2.
