  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\nSection 1.  Declaration of legislative findings and intent.  The Council of the City of New York hereby finds that the increasing scarcity of affordable housing in the City makes it crucial to preserve existing subsidized housing units.  Private owners are electing to prepay subsidized mortgages or to opt out of project-based subsidy programs at an alarming rate.  No longer constrained by such programs, owners are putting their buildings up for sale, with the new purchasers forcing out low- and moderate-income tenants as the buildings open to market rents.\nOne in ten federally subsidized assisted rental housing units in New York City has been or is in the process of being removed from the affordable housing stock, according to data compiled by the Community Service Society.  Compounding this problem, the federal government has eliminated funding for programs designed to promote the preservation of subsidized housing, and it does not appear that any new federal programs will be funded to create new subsidized housing.  In the face of such conversions from affordable housing to market rate housing, some city and state governments have enacted legislation granting a right of first refusal and a first opportunity to purchase to low to moderate-income residents who will maintain the buildings as housing for low- and moderate-income residents.  The City of New York has an obligation to safeguard against the loss of affordable housing and the Council is enacting this local law to help ensure that the assisted rental housing stock is maintained for the people of New York.\n§2.\tTitle 26 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new chapter 9 to read as follows:\nChapter 9\nRight of First Refusal and First Opportunity to Purchase\n\n§26-801  Definitions.\n§26-802  Notification of impending conversion.\n§26-803  Notification of bona fide offer to purchase.\n§26-804  Appraisal determination.\n§26-805  Right of first refusal.\n§26-806  First opportunity to purchase.\n§26-807   Prior notification.\n§26-808   Permanent affordability.\n§26-809   Right of transfer.\n§26-810   Conversion of property.\n§26-811   Penalty.\n§26-812  Exclusions.\n§26-813  Judicial review.\n\n\n§26-801  Definitions.  For the purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a)\t“Affordable” shall mean that rental expenses for dwelling units do not exceed thirty percent of the annual gross household income of the existing tenants, and/or where rental expenses do not exceed the rent levels allowable pursuant to the rent restrictions applicable to such dwelling units prior to conversion, provided however that dwelling units which become vacant in assisted rental housing should not be rented to households whose income exceeds eighty percent of the New York metropolitan area median income as determined by the United States department of housing and urban development.\n(b)\t“Appraised value” shall mean the value as determined by a majority vote of an advisory panel of three appraisers who shall perform such appraisal in accordance with the American Arbitration Association’s rules for the real estate industry.\n(c)\t“Assisted rental housing” shall mean a privately-owned multiple dwelling or group of multiple dwelling units managed together under the same ownership in which the majority of dwelling units therein are subject to federal, state or city income eligibility restrictions and in which rents for such  dwelling units are controlled, regulated or assisted by a federal, state or city agency pursuant to a regulatory agreement or rental assistance agreement designed to make such  dwelling units affordable on a project-based basis.

In such event, the owner shall give notice to the tenant association, or if no tenant association exists, to each tenant, or if applicable, to a qualified entity, and to the department. However, should the owner at any time decide to take an action that will result in conversion, the twelve- month notice period of this section as well as all other applicable requirements of this chapter shall be complied with.\n(f)\tNotwithstanding any of the above, if any applicable supervening statute or program has a notice requirement substantially similar to any notice requirement of this section, then the notice requirement under this section shall be that of the supervening statute or program.\n(g)\tNotwithstanding any of the above, if the notices required by this section requires more information than is required by any applicable supervening city, state or federal statute or program, then such additional information shall be provided within the time period established by the supervening statute or program.\n§26-803  Notification of bona fide offer to purchase.

Should such time period be extended past the notice period provided for in subdivision  a of section 26-802 of this chapter, then the provisions of the applicable assisted rentalhousing program shall remain in full force and effect to the extent permitted by law.\n(d)\tExcept where the owner and a tenant association, or if applicable, a qualified entity, agree to a purchase price of the assisted rental housing at an amount below the appraised value, any offer made pursuant to this section shall be accepted by the owner.\n(e)\tIf a tenant association, or if applicable, a qualified entity, does not submit its offer in writing to the owner and the department within the time periods stated in subdivision  b of this section following notice by the owner in compliance with subdivision  a of section 26-802 of this chapter, then such right will be deemed waived and the owner shall have no further obligations under this section.

Such owner or purchaser may, with the agreement of the tenant or tenants, relocate such tenant or tenants to comparable units with comparable rents in accordance with procedures to be established by the rules of the department.\n§26-811  Penalty.

The total civil penalties may not exceed one hundred thousand dollars per dwelling unit. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as prohibiting the tenant association, or if no tenant association exists, the tenants, or if applicable, a qualified entity, from seeking injunctive relief against a non-compliant owner. Such proceeding shall be brought  in a court of competent jurisdiction.\n§26-812  Exclusions.  (a) Nothing in this chapter shall affect any existing agreement between a tenant association and an owner regarding the management and operation of the assisted rental housing or the transfer of the assisted rental housing to a tenant association or similar organization in effect on the effective date of this chapter, except that any renewal, modification or amendment of such agreement occurring on or after the effective date of this local law shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter.\n(b)\tNothing in this chapter shall  affect  any existing agreement between an owner and one or more governmental entities relating to the management and operation of a multiple dwelling that is not otherwise subject to the private housing finance law or to federal law.\n(c)\tNothing in this chapter shall affect an owner or purchaser who wants to refinance in order to maintain participation in an assisted rental housing program.\n(d)\tThe provisions of this chapter shall not apply to a purchase by a governmental entity implementing its powers of eminent domain; a judicially supervised sale or transfer of property; any bankruptcy proceedings; or operation of law.\n(e)\t The provisions of this chapter shall not apply where a notice as described in section 26-807 of this chapter was properly given in accordance with any other applicable provision of law and forty-five or fewer days remain prior to the expiration of such applicable notice period.\n§26-813  Judicial Review.
