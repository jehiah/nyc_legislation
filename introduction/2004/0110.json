When the ambient temperature is in excess of forty degrees Fahrenheit, no person shall cause or permit the engine of a bus as defined in section one hundred four of the vehicle and traffic law to idle while parking, standing, or stopping (as defined above) at any terminal point, whether or not enclosed, along an established route.\n(b)  The department of transportation shall post signs relating to prohibited idling that shall comply with the standards set forth in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices and, where practicable, include the maximum penalty that may be imposed for a violation of subdivision a of this section as follows: \n(1) a sign shall be posted at each exit within the city of New York of each bridge and tunnel having only one terminus in the city of New York; \n(2) signs shall be posted at a minimum of five locations in each borough where two or more truck routes, whether local or through routes, intersect;\n(3) a sign shall be posted at each bus layover area (other than school bus layover areas), designated by the commissioner of transportation pursuant to section 4-10(c)(3) of title 34 of the rules of the city of New York;\n(4) a sign shall be posted at each multiple use bus terminal point; \n(5) a sign shall be posted in close proximity to each school bus depot; and,\n(6) signs shall be posted at other appropriate locations throughout the city as jointly determined by the commissioner and the commissioner of transportation, including but not limited to, locations for which the city receives a substantial number of complaints of idling motor vehicles.  \n(c)  For the purpose of this section only the term \"school bus depot” shall mean any garage, lot or other facility where buses that transport children to or from schools are parked over night and the term “multiple use bus terminal point” shall mean a location that is both a terminal point of at least one bus route (other than a school bus route) and a bus stop (other than a school bus stop) on one or more other bus routes. \n(d)  In any proceeding relating to a violation of the restrictions on idling it shall not be a defense that a sign required by this section was absent at the time of the violation.\n\t§ 3.
