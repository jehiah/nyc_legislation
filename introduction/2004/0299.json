  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\nSection 1. Legislative Findings and Intent.\n\nThe City Council finds that graffiti is a public nuisance, one that degrades the quality of life in neighborhoods and communities across the city.  Graffiti creates an atmosphere of neglect, inviting criminal activity and contributing to a feeling of disorderliness and fear.  \nIn light of these considerations, it is important that graffiti in public view be cleaned as quickly as possible, while respecting property rights and First Amendment free speech rights.\nThe goal of this legislation is to accommodate these important interests and to craft a solution to the City’s graffiti problem that both adequately addresses the need to rid our communities of graffiti as well as protect our important freedoms.  By imposing fines against the owners of certain property who fail to remove graffiti from their premises, coupled with granting to the City the ability to clean graffiti in public view from commercial and residential buildings, after an adequate notification process to property owners of such buildings, this legislation will improve the quality of life for our residents.\n§ 2.  The administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 10-117.3 to read as follows:\n\n§10-117.3 Remedies for failure to remove graffiti from certain premises. \n\na. Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following terms shall have the following meanings:\n1. “Graffiti” means any letter, word, name, number, symbol, slogan, message, drawing, picture, writing or other mark of any kind visible to the public from a public place that is drawn, painted, chiseled, scratched, or etched on a commercial building or residential building, or any portion thereof, including fencing, that is not consented to by the owner of the commercial building or residential building.  There shall be a rebuttable presumption that such letter, word, name, number, symbol, slogan, message, drawing, picture, writing or other mark of any kind is not consented to by the owner.

Legislative Findings and Intent.\\par\n\\par\n\\pard\\fi720\\sl480\\slmult1\\qj The City Council finds that graffiti is a public nuisance, one that degrades the quality of life in neighborhoods and communities across the city.  Graffiti creates an atmosphere of neglect, inviting criminal activity and contributing to a feeling of disorderliness and fear.  \\par\nIn light of these considerations, it is important that graffiti in public view be cleaned as quickly as possible, while respecting property rights and First Amendment free speech rights.\\par\nThe goal of this legislation is to accommodate these important interests and to craft a solution to the City\\rquote s graffiti problem that both adequately addresses the need to rid our communities of graffiti as well as protect our important freedoms.  By imposing fines against the owners of certain property who fail to remove graffiti from their premises, coupled with granting to the City the ability to clean graffiti in public view from commercial and residential buildings, after an adequate notification process to property owners of such buildings, this legislation will improve the quality of life for our residents.\\par\n\\pard\\qj\\'a7 2.
