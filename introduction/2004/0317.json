No demolition permit for a building any portion of which is fifty or more years old shall be issued without following the provisions of this section.  If a building is of unknown age, it shall be presumed for the purposes of this section that the building is fifty or more years old. \nb. A building is significant if (i) in the opinion of the chair of the commission it meets the criteria for a landmark, an interior landmark, a landmark site or part of an historic district pursuant to section 25-302 of this code; or (ii) the building is listed on, or is within an area listed on, either the national or state register of historic places; or the building has been found eligible for listing on either the national or state register of historic places.\nc. The commissioner of buildings shall within seven days of receipt of an application for a demolition permit for a building which is fifty or more years old forward a copy of the application to the chair of the commission.

If agreed to in writing by the applicant, the determination of the commission may be postponed.\ni.  A building shall be preferably preserved if the commission makes a preliminary determination that the building meets the criteria for designation as a landmark, an interior landmark, a landmark site or part of an historic district pursuant to section 25-302 of this chapter, and that it is in the public interest to be preserved rather than demolished until the formal designation process is completed in accordance with section 25-303 of this chapter. \nj.

Following a determination that the building is significant and shall be preferably preserved, the commission may designate the preferably preserved building as a landmark, an interior landmark, a landmark site or part of an historic district, pursuant to section 25-303 of this code.\nn.  Following the expiration of the twelve-month period established in accordance with subdivision j or k of this section, the commissioner of buildings may issue a demolition permit if the building has not been calendared for a public hearing for designation as a landmark, interior landmark, a landmark site or part of an historic district by the commission. \n§2.
