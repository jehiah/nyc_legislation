  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection One.  Legislative Findings and Intent\n\tThe New York City Police Department offers many valuable services to assist in the prevention of automobile theft, including the VIN-Etch Program, which allows registered car owners to have their car window etched with the vehicle’s VIN (Vehicle Identification Number).  Having the VIN etched in the window makes the car less desirable to a car thief and helps identify stolen parts in salvage yards.  The NYPD offers this program free-of-charge in all precincts.\n\tSome automobile dealerships, when offering auto theft protection programs, will alert consumers to the benefits of VIN-Etching, and offer to perform this service for a fee.  Other dealerships will offer this service, and charge consumers for it, as part of a larger auto theft protection package.  Automobile dealers, however, should not be permitted to charge for a VIN-etching program that is offered free-of-charge by the NYPD, and the Council finds that a local law prohibiting this conduct is appropriate.\n\t§2. Chapter five of title 20 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new subchapter 14, to read as follows:\n\n\n\nSUBCHAPTER 14\nAUTOMOBILE DEALERSHIPS\n§20-770 VIN Etching Program\n\n§20-770 VIN Etching Program \n               a.

It shall be unlawful for any person or entity that sells automobiles to charge a consumer for the VIN etching of an automobile’s windows.\n              c.  Penalties.
