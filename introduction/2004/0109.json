  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\nSection one.   Legislative Declaration.  The Council finds that certain areas of New York City are excessively crowded with food and general vendors.  Though some of these merchants are properly licensed with the Departments of Health and Consumer Affairs, many are not.  Moreover, both licensed and unlicensed vendors are operating in violation of certain Health and Consumer Affairs laws and regulations, primarily by vending in illegal locations.    \t\t\nThe Council finds that as a result of these violations, neighborhood citizens have a difficult time navigating their own streets.  They are overwhelmed by the noise and congestion the vendors generate, and they wish for a more orderly community.  In response to their concerns, the Council finds it necessary to increase the fines imposed on vendors operating illegally.  Through such legislation, the Council intends to curtail the improper growth of vendors in certain neighborhoods while protecting those merchants who operate legally.\n§2.

For any succeeding offense within a period of two years of the date of a first offense, this misdemeanor shall be punishable by a fine of not less than five hundred dollars nor more than one thousand two hundred fifty dollars, or by imprisonment for not more than three months or by both such fine and imprisonment.  In addition, any police officer may seize any vehicle used to transport goods to a general vendor, along with the goods contained therein, where the driver is required to but cannot produce evidence of a distributor’s license.  Any vehicle and goods so seized may be subject to forfeiture upon notice and judicial determination.
