Upon submission of an appeal, the chief inspector shall have five business days to determine the appeal.  If the appeal is rejected, the chief inspector shall, with the pre-approval of the applicant, submit an immediate appeal to the borough commissioner;\n(2)  if the appeal is denied and if the applicant is required to make an appeal, then the applicant can further appeal within three business days of receipt of the rejection to the borough commissioner, or his or her designee, in which the application is located.  Upon submission of an appeal, the borough commissioner shall have five business days to determine the appeal;\n(3)  if the appeal is further denied, then the applicant can further appeal within three business days of receipt of the rejection to a panel consisting of each of the borough commissioners.
