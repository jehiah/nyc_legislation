Chapter one of title 17 of the administrative code of the city of New York is hereby amended by adding a new section 17-188 to read as follows:\n\t§17-188  Automated external defibrillators.  a.  Definitions.  For the purposes of this section, the following terms shall have the following meanings:\n1.  “Automated external defibrillator” means a medical device, approved by the United States food and drug administration, that: (i) is capable of recognizing the presence or absence in a patient of ventricular fibrillation and rapid ventricular tachycardia; (ii) is capable of determining, without intervention by an individual, whether defibrillation should be performed on a patient; (iii) upon determining that defibrillation should be performed, automatically charges and requests delivery of an electrical impulse to a patient’s heart; and (iv) upon action by an individual, delivers an appropriate electrical impulse to a patient’s heart to perform defibrillation.\n\t2.\t“Owner or operator” means the owner, manager, operator, or other person or persons having control of a public place.\n\t3.\t“Public place” means the publicly accessible areas of the following places to which the public is invited or permitted: (i) public buildings maintained by the division of facilities management and construction of the department of citywide administrative services or any successor; (ii) parks under the jurisdiction of the department of parks and recreation identified pursuant to subdivision e of this section; (iii) ferry terminals owned and operated by the city of New York served by ferry boats with a passenger capacity of one thousand or more persons; (iv) nursing homes, as defined in section 2801 of the New York state public health law; (v) senior centers, which include facilities operated by the city of New York or operated by an entity that has contracted with the city to provide services to senior citizens on a regular basis, such as meals and other on-site activities; (vi) golf courses,  stadia and arenas; and (vii) health clubs that are commercial establishments offering instruction, training or assistance and/or facilities for the preservation, maintenance, encouragement or development of physical fitness or well-being that have a membership of at least two hundred and fifty people, and which shall include, but not be limited to, health spas, health studios, gymnasiums, weight control studios, martial arts and self-defense schools or any other commercial establishment offering a similar course of physical training.\t\n\tb.\tAutomated external defibrillators required.

Such automated external defibrillators shall be readily accessible for use during medical emergencies. Any information regarding use of automated external defibrillators deemed necessary by the department in accordance with rules promulgated pursuant to subdivision f of  this section shall accompany and be kept with each automated external defibrillator.  Any automated external defibrillator required pursuant to this subdivision shall be acquired, possessed and operated in accordance with the requirements of section 3000-b of the New York state public health law. \n\tc.\tNotice required.  The owner or operator of a public place shall provide written notice to the public, by means of signs, printed material or other form of written communication, indicating the availability of automated external defibrillators for emergency use in such public place and providing information on how to obtain automated external defibrillator training. The type, size, style, location and language of such notice shall be determined in accordance with rules promulgated by the department pursuant to subdivision f of this section.
