  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\nSection One. Legislative findings and intent. The city of New York engages in annual disbursements of billions of dollars in public funds through one of the largest budgets in the United States, and is, therefore, desirous of preventing the payment of fraudulent claims by the city at taxpayers’ expense. Compensation by the city of claims that are false or fraudulent has a considerable impact upon the city’s treasury through the loss of untold amounts of public dollars. \nThe federal false claims act provides an excellent precedent for combating fraud by government contractors and other parties. Since the federal false claims act was substantially amended in 1986, the federal government has recovered billions of dollars under the act.  Additionally, a number of states have enacted civil false claims statutes of their own in order to impede fraud in state programs and to protect state treasuries.\nThe Council therefore finds that the city of New York should enact legislation modeled on the federal false claims act, to enhance the city’s ability to recover monetary damages from parties who file fraudulent claims for payment of city funds and to recover the substantial costs that are incurred in protecting the taxpayers against such fraud.\n§2. Title 7 of the administrative code of the city of New York is hereby amended by adding a new chapter 8 to read as follows:\nCHAPTER  8\nNEW YORK CITY FALSE CLAIMS ACT\n\n§7-801.\tShort title.\n§7-802.\tDefinitions.\n§7-803.\tFalse claims.\n§7-804.\tCivil actions for false claims.\n§7-805.\tRemedies of employees.\n§7-806.\tLimitation of actions; burden of proof.  \n§7-807.\tOther law enforcement authority and duties.\n§7-808.\tAnnual report\n§7-809.\tComptroller.\n§7-810.\tRegulations.\n\n§7-801. Short title. This chapter shall be known as the \"New York city false claims act.\"\n§7-802.  Definitions. For purposes of this chapter, the following terms shall mean:\n1. “Civil enforcement action” means a legal action brought pursuant to section 7-804 of this chapter for the commission of any act or acts described in subsection b of section 7-803 of this chapter.\n2. “Claim” means any request or demand, whether under a contract or otherwise, for money or property which is made to any employee, officer, or agent of the city, or to any contractor, grantee or other recipient, if the city provides the money or property which is requested or demanded or will reimburse such contractor, grantee or other recipient for the money or property which is requested or demanded.  “Claim” also encompasses any record or statement used in presenting an obligation to pay or transmit money or property either directly or indirectly to the city.\n3. “False claim” means any claim, or information relating to a claim, which is false or fraudulent.\n4. “Knowing” and “knowingly” mean that with respect to information, a person: (i) has actual knowledge of the falsity of the information, or (ii) acts in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the information, or (iii) acts in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information.  Proof of specific intent to defraud is not required.\n5. “Person” means any natural person, corporation, partnership, firm, organization, association or other legal entity or individual, other than the city.\n§7-803. False claims. a.

Pending and Related Actions. 1. No person, other than the city, may intervene or bring a related action based upon the facts underlying a civil enforcement action, unless such other person has first obtained the permission of the city to intervene or to bring such related action.\n2. Regardless of whether the corporation counsel has commenced a civil enforcement action or another party has been designated to do so, the city may elect to pursue any alternate action with respect to the presentation of false claims, provided that the person who submitted the proposed civil complaint upon which such alternate action is based, if any, shall be entitled to the same percentage share of any cash proceeds recovered by the city as such person would have been entitled to if such alternate action was a civil enforcement action.\ng. Rights of the parties.  1.

Such restrictions may include, but need not be limited to: (i) limiting the number of witnesses such person may call, (ii) limiting the length of the testimony of such witnesses, (iii) limiting such person’s cross-examination of witnesses, or (iv) otherwise limiting such person’s participation in the litigation.\n4.

Legislative findings and intent. The city of New York engages in annual disbursements of billions of dollars in public funds through one of the largest budgets in the United States, and is, therefore, desirous of preventing the payment of fraudulent claims by the city at taxpayers\\rquote  expense. Compensation by the city of claims that are false or fraudulent has a considerable impact upon the city\\rquote s treasury through the loss of untold amounts of public dollars. \\par\nThe federal false claims act provides an excellent precedent for combating fraud by government contractors and other parties. Since the federal false claims act was substantially amended in 1986, the federal government has recovered billions of dollars under the act.  Additionally, a number of states have enacted civil false claims statutes of their own in order to impede fraud in state programs and to protect state treasuries.\\par\nThe Council therefore finds that the city of New York should enact legislation modeled on the federal false claims act, to enhance the city\\rquote s ability to recover monetary damages from parties who file fraudulent claims for payment of city funds and to recover the substantial costs that are incurred in protecting the taxpayers against such fraud.\\i\\par\n\\pard\\fi720\\sl480\\slmult1\\i0\\'a72.
