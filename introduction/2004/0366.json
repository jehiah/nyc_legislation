  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\nSection 1.   Legislative findings and intent.  The Council finds that domestic violence is a continuing problem in New York City.  The persistent occurrence of such violence, and the fatalities that often result, reveal an urgent need to better understand the various causes of these crimes, as well as the adequacy of victim assistance and prevention services.  Accordingly, the Council finds that a committee dedicated to reviewing and analyzing aggregate information regarding domestic violence fatalities that occur in New York City is needed.   The examination of such information will enable the committee to analyze data and any patterns that may emerge from an examination of such information, analyze any demographic changes that may occur over time relating to such incidents and formulate recommendations regarding the coordination and improvement of services to victims to ultimately reduce the number of these tragedies.  \n§2.  Section 19 of the New York city charter is amended by adding a new subdivision d to read as follows:  \n\td.1.
