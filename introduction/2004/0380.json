  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\tSection 1.  Declaration of legislative findings and intent.  The Council finds that employees working in various departments and agencies in the City of New York have certain job characteristics similar to those of employees working in the City’s uniformed services, such as police, fire, sanitation and correction services.  Furthermore, the Council recognizes that certain employees working in the City’s uniformed services have unique bargaining rights under the New York City Collective Bargaining Law (New York City Administrative Code §12-301, et. seq.).  The Council finds that individuals with job characteristics similar to those employees working in the City’s uniformed services should be afforded the same unique bargaining rights as those afforded to individuals working in such services.  The Council further finds that such changes are consistent with the New York State Taylor Law, in that they are designed to “promote harmonious and cooperative relationships between government and its employees...” New York State Civil Service Law (CVS) §200.  Furthermore, the Council finds that these changes are procedural in nature, affecting the manner in which bargaining is conducted on behalf of the affected employees, and will not provide a particular benefit to such employees, nor prescribe a certain result from collective bargaining.  The Council finds that such procedural changes are permitted by and in accordance with the Taylor Law. CVS §212.\t\n\t§2.\tParagraph (4) of subdivision (a) of section 12-307 of the administrative code of the city of New York is hereby amended to read as follows:\n\t(4) all matters, including but not limited to pensions, overtime and time and leave rules which affect employees in the uniformed police, fire, sanitation and correction services, or any other police officer as defined in subdivision thirty-four of section 1.20 of the criminal procedure law who is also defined as a police officer in this code, shall be negotiated with the certified employee organizations representing the employees involved.  For purposes of this paragraph only[,]: \n(i)\t     employees of the uniformed fire service shall also include persons employed at any level of position or service by the fire department of the city of New York as fire alarm dispatchers and supervisors of fire alarm dispatchers[.

Declaration of legislative findings and intent.  The Council finds that employees working in various departments and agencies in the City of New York have certain job characteristics similar to those of employees working in the City\\rquote s uniformed services, such as police, fire, sanitation and correction services.  Furthermore, the Council recognizes that certain employees working in the City\\rquote s uniformed services have unique bargaining rights under the New York City Collective Bargaining Law (New York City Administrative Code \\'a712-301, et. seq.).  The Council finds that individuals with job characteristics similar to those employees working in the City\\rquote s uniformed services should be afforded the same unique bargaining rights as those afforded to individuals working in such services.  The Council further finds that such changes are consistent with the New York State Taylor Law, in that they are designed to \\ldblquote promote harmonious and cooperative relationships between government and its employees...\\rdblquote  New York State Civil Service Law (CVS) \\'a7200.  Furthermore, the Council finds that these changes are procedural in nature, affecting the manner in which bargaining is conducted on behalf of the affected employees, and will not provide a particular benefit to such employees, nor prescribe a certain result from collective bargaining.  The Council finds that such procedural changes are permitted by and in accordance with the Taylor Law.
