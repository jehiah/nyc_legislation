Chapter two of title four of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding thereto a new section 4-207 to read as follows:\n§ 4-207 Clean on-site power generation survey.  a. By January 1, 2005, the department of \ncitywide administrative services, in conjunction with the economic development corporation and the department of buildings, shall conduct a survey of all buildings, structures or similar facilities owned by the city to determine whether clean on-site generation projects are appropriate for such facilities.  Such survey shall include, but not be limited to, the incorporation of technical and financial considerations.  For the purposes of this section only, the term “clean on-site generation” shall mean electric generation that is connected to the distribution level of the grid, is located at or near the intended place of use and produces fewer emissions of carbon dioxide than a new combined-cycle natural-gas fired power plant of similar capacity.  This term may include the generation of electricity through cogeneration, solar power, wind power, anaerobic digesters, fuel cells and the use of microturbines.\n\tb. The survey required to be completed pursuant to subdivision a of this section shall be \nreviewed by the agencies listed in that subdivision every two years and shall be updated, as appropriate, to reflect newly acquired facilities, changes in existing facilities and any circumstances that may alter the conclusions made in such survey.\n\tc. The survey and updates required to be completed pursuant to subdivision a and subdivision b of this section shall be submitted to the mayor and the speaker of the council within ten days of their completion.\n\t§2.
