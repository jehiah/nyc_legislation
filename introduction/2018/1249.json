  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Subdivisions a, b and c of section 19-507.1 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 51 for the year 2016, are amended to read as follows:\n      a. (1) Any taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver may attend a remedial or refresher course approved by the commission or a motor vehicle accident prevention course approved by the New York state department of motor vehicles. Upon presentation to the commission of proof of satisfactory completion of a commission-approved remedial or refresher course by such driver, three points shall be deducted from the number of points assessed under the persistent violators program against his or her commission-issued driver's license, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph. A taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver shall be eligible for a point reduction pursuant to this [subdivision] paragraph for points assessed by the commission against his or her commission-issued driver's license only once within a five-year period. \n      (2) Upon presentation to the commission of proof of satisfactory completion of a motor vehicle accident prevention course approved by the New York state department of motor vehicles, three points shall be deducted from the number of points accrued under the persistent violator program for points assessed by the New York state department of motor vehicles or an equivalent licensing agency of the driver's state of residence against the driver's license issued to such taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver by such department or agency, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph. A taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver shall be eligible for a point reduction pursuant to this paragraph for points assessed by the New York state department of motor vehicles or an equivalent licensing agency of the driver's state of residence only once within an eighteen-month period.\n      (3) In the event no [such approved] commission-approved remedial or refresher course is available at the time such driver seeks to enroll, [such driver may take a course provided for in paragraph one of subdivision c of section 19-507.2 of this chapter.
