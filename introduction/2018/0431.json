  "Summary": "This bill would create an energy efficiency program for multiple dwellings.",
  "TextID": 62052,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n      Section 1. Subchapter 2 of chapter 2 of title 27 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new article 15 to read as follows:\nARTICLE 15\n\nENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAM FOR MULTIPLE DWELLINGS\n\n\t� 27-2056.19 Energy efficiency program for multiple dwellings.\n� 27-2056.20 Energy efficient measures taken after the issuance of a violation.\n      � 27-2056.21 Eligible energy efficiency measures.\n\n\t� 27-2056.19 Energy efficiency program for multiple dwellings. a. For purposes of this chapter, the term \"eligible violation\" means (i) a violation which is set forth in rule by the department as eligible for the energy efficiency program for multiple dwellings and (ii) non-hazardous violations.\n      b. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the commissioner shall develop an energy efficiency program for multiple dwellings. Such energy efficiency program shall allow an owner of a multiple dwelling who receives an eligible violation to have the civil penalties for such violations waived or reduced where such owner enters into a regulatory agreement with the commissioner, requiring such owner to undertake eligible energy efficiency measures. Such regulatory agreement shall specify that any eligible energy efficiency measures that an owner undertakes shall not be the basis for a rent increase. Civil penalties shall be reduced to an amount equal to the amount of money such owner spends to undertake such energy efficiency measures. Where an owner has received more than one eligible violation, such owner may couple the civil penalties for such violations in an amount not to exceed $3,000 for the purposes of undertaking energy efficiency measures. \n      � 27-2056.20 Eligible energy efficiency measures. The commissioner shall create a list of energy efficiency measures which owners may undertake as part of the energy efficiency program for multiple dwellings. Such energy efficiency measures shall include, but need not be limited to, the following:\n\t(1) Energy efficient upgrades, including, building shell improvements, lighting upgrades, installing energy efficient appliances, installing programmable thermostats; and\n\t(2) For multiple dwellings that do not exceed 25,000 gross square feet, benchmarking, undergoing energy audits, and undertaking retro-commissioning measures.\n\tc. An owner who enters into such a regulatory agreement pursuant to subdivision b of this section and is found to not be in compliance with such agreement shall have the original civil penalty or penalties reinstated or doubled.\n      � 2. This local law takes effect 180 days after it becomes law, except that the office or agency designated by the mayor may take such actions as are necessary for its implementation, including the promulgation of rules, prior to such effective date.\n\nGP/SSY\nLS 8718/ Int.
