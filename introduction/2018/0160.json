  "Summary": "This bill would permit the city to accept bitcoins, through a financial intermediary, for the payment of fines, fees, charges and civil penalties. One or more financial intermediaries would contract with the city to provide such service where they would accept the bitcoin payment and then forward an equivalent amount, in dollars, to the city in satisfaction of the fine, fee, charge or civil penalty. A fee, to match the actual costs of the transaction, might be appended.",
