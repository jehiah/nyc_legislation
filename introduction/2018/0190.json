  "Summary": "This bill would create a one-year pilot program in which body-worn cameras would be worn by food sanitary inspectors in the course of performing sanitary inspections of food service establishments (FSE). The pilot program would require that cameras are worn in 10% of all inspections during the one year period of the program. The program would be limited to food service establishments subject to the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene’s (DOHMH) letter-grading program and exclude food vendors and other FSEs. The program would conclude after one year with the submission of a report by DOHMH to the Mayor and Council on statistics and recommendations relating to the program.",
