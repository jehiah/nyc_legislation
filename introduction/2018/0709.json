  "Summary": "This proposed legislation requires the department of environmental protection to provide to the public, on the city’s website, an online interactive map with  information regarding the known lead water service lines and to make best efforts to identify all lead water service lines, including privately owned service lines, by consulting relevant city or public records or by any other relevant means.  It also requires the department to provide information to users about lead contamination prevention, lead water test kits and how to replace lead service lines.  The department must replace any known lead water service lines that are owned by the department no later than December 31, 2025.\r\n\r\nThereafter the department must provide to the council and the mayor an annual report on the locations of all known lead water service lines, efforts underway to replace lead water supply mains and service lines and the status of public outreach and education efforts on the prevention of lead contamination.",
