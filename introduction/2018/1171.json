When DOB has made a finding that an owner made a false statement, the bill would also require DOB to: (a) send written notice to the NYC Council, the Department of Investigations, the Division of Housing and Community Renewal, and the Tenant Protection Unit; (b) refer the matter to the relevant District Attorney and the Attorney General for potential criminal prosecution; and (c) report on the punitive actions it took in every case in which it found evidence of a falsified application for a building permit.","TextID":66494,"Text":"Int.
