  "Summary": "This local law amends 24-207 of the Administrative Code by adding a new subdivision 24-207(g) ((i) and (ii)) that would require the Department of Environmental Protection to notify the responsible party at a construction site when the Department receives two or more reports of unreasonable noise within a 24-hour period regarding emergency work performed at the construction site during such period of time. The local law also requires the Department to inspect any construction site for which the department receives four or more reports of unreasonable noise within a 48-hour period regarding emergency work performed at that construction site. Finally, this local law amends subdivisions b and c of section 24-220 of the Administrative Code to require that a notice to residents be posted that provides information regarding how to report unreasonable noise and to serve a citizen’s complaint.",
