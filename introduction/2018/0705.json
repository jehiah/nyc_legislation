The local law also requires the Department to inspect any construction site for which the department receives four or more reports of unreasonable noise within a 48-hour period regarding emergency work performed at that construction site. Finally, this local law amends subdivisions b and c of section 24-220 of the Administrative Code to require that a notice to residents be posted that provides information regarding how to report unreasonable noise and to serve a citizen’s complaint.","TextID":62108,"Text":"Int.
