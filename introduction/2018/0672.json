Required information would include information about the City’s civil service process, including the application process, hiring system, and descriptions of civil service tests; the titles of upcoming exams open to high school graduates and related job descriptions; information about fees and fee waivers; and, a link to find more information online. The bill would increase student awareness of civil service exams, making potential employment information more accessible and encouraging students to pursue an alternative path to employment.","TextID":63954,"Text":"Int.
