  "Summary": "The proposed legislation would require the creation of a task force regarding the transportation of students in temporary housing. The task force would be comprised of individuals including the commissioners of the Department of Social Services and the Department of Housing Preservation and Development; the Deputy Chancellor for School Climate and Wellness at the DOE, which oversees student transportation, family assistants from the DOE; representatives of organizations that provide shelter for families with children; representatives of companies that provide student-busing services; at least two parents of students who are or were formerly students in temporary housing; the Chairperson of the Council’s Committee on General Welfare; and additional members. The task force would meet a number of times sufficient to achieve its purpose and would issue a report assessing barriers to arranging transportation for students in temporary housing and recommendations for addressing those barriers. The task force would also report on any recommendations that are implemented 12 and 24 months after its submission of the initial report. The task force would terminate upon the publication of the report issued 24 months after submission of the initial report.",
