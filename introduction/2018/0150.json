  "Summary": "The proposed legislation would require the creation of a task force regarding the transportation of homeless students. The task force would include the commissioners of the Department of Homeless Services and the Department of Social Services, the Deputy Chancellor for Operations at the Department of Education (DOE), which oversees student transportation, family assistants from the DOE, representatives of organizations that provide shelter for families with children, and representatives of companies that provide student-busing services. The task force would meet at least quarterly for a year for a year and at the end of the year would issue a report assessing the barriers to arranging transportation for students living in shelter and recommendations for addressing those barriers. The task force would terminate upon the publication of its report.",
