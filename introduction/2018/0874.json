  "Summary": "This bill would establish requirements to strengthen interagency communication, tenant notification, and inspections related to lead-based paint and lead dust hazards. First, this bill would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to add certain information regarding lead dust hazards to existing pamphlets. This bill would also expand existing DOHMH referral procedures where a child may have been exposed to lead to automatically refer such child to a medical provider for blood lead testing, regardless of whether a referral is requested by a parent or guardian. This bill would also require DOHMH to post a notice in the lobby of a building when, in the course of completing certain inspections, a lead hazard has been discovered in the common area. Building owners would be required to post additional notices on every floor. This bill would also require statements of compliance with lead safe work practices as a condition of certain permit applications, and would require the Department of Buildings (DOB) to maintain records of all such permits. This bill would add lead safe work practices to the requirements of a Tenant Protection Plan, while also allowing DOB to issue a stop work order where DOHMH has made a referral based on unsafe lead work practices. Where DOB receives a complaint alleging the violation of the lead safe practices described in a tenant protection plan, this bill would require DOB to inspect within 24 hours, take dust wipes upon inspection, and refer such dust wipes and any hazardous conditions to DOHMH for inspection and analysis.",
