The bill would also extend all city benefits and services to LGBTQ veterans who have bad discharge papers solely because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.  The bill would also require DVS to issue discharged LGBTQ veterans a certificate of eligibility that can be used as proof that a discharged LGBTQ veteran is eligible for certain city benefits or services available to veterans.","TextID":62043,"Text":"Int.
