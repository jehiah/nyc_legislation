  "Summary": "This bill would expand upon Local Law 94 of 2016 and require that city jails that accept visitors and police precincts offer lactation rooms to persons using on-site services. If it is not practicable for a police precinct or jail to provide a lactation room due to security concerns or limited space, the bill would require that those agencies provide an explanation for why it is not practicable, as well as any future plans to improve the availability of lactation rooms.",
