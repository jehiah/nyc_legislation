  "Summary": "The bill would require the Equal Employment Practices Commission (EEPC) to analyze and report annually on whether agencies are meeting their racial and ethnic affirmative employment objectives and, when not, identify the underutilized groups and provide recommendations on corrective action. The EEPC would also be required to review the city’s racial and ethnic classification categories, and provide recommendations on whether such categories accurately capture the racial and ethnic composition of the city’s government workforce. Finally, the EEPC would be required to provide recommendations to strengthen agency affirmative employment plans, and improve diversity in recruitment, selection, retention and promotion of City government employees. The reporting requirement would be repealed ten years after the law takes effect.",
