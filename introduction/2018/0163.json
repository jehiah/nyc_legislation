  "Summary": "Bus rapid transit (BRT) is a system that is designed to make bus service faster, more reliable and efficient through features such as off-board fare payment, dedicated bus lanes and giving priority to buses at intersections. Since 2012, the New York City Department of Transportation (DOT) and Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) have collaborated on a component of BRT called Traffic Signal Priority (TSP). TSP is a technology that is capable of enhancing traditional transit services by facilitating bus movements through intersections controlled by traffic signals. Since June 2017, TSP is active at 260 intersections on five bus routes. \r\n\r\nDue to the myriad of transportation issues facing New Yorkers, this proposed local law would require DOT, to the extent practicable in cooperation with relevant city and state agencies including the MTA, to upgrade at least ten bus routes per year over the next four years to TSP. This would double their current planned pace.",

The department of transportation shall identify those city intersections that can provide riders with the greatest benefits through implementation of transit signal priority, and shall to the extent practicable, in cooperation with relevant city and state agencies including the metropolitan transportation authority, implement transit signal priority on at least ten bus routes per year in each of the next four calendar years following the passage of this local law. \n      b. The department shall post on its website the intersections identified pursuant to this local law and bus routes that receive transit signal priority.\n      c. If the department is not able to meet the implementation deadlines created by this local law in any given year, it shall promptly submit to the mayor and speaker of the council a memorandum detailing why the target will not be met and identifying remedial steps the department has the authority to take to achieve the implementation timeframe in subsequent years.\n      ï¿½ 2.
