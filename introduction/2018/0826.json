  "Summary": "This bill would amend the Administrative Code to expand the Fire Department’s reporting requirements following fires that cause civilian fatalities, life threatening injury, or are deemed serious fire incidents.  First, the Department would be required to report on information related to the technology and operation of smoke detectors or alarms following all fires that result in a civilian fatality or life threatening injuries.  Additionally, the bill requires new reporting on the presence and activation of automatic sprinkler systems at the location of each serious fire incident where the department deploys greater than three fire engines.",
