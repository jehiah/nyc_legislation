The term \"approved statement of campaign childcare eligibility\" shall mean a statement submitted by the candidate, and approved by the board, demonstrating eligibility for childcare services consistent with the requirements of subparagraph 13 of paragraph a of subdivision 21 of this section.

For purposes of this subdivision, the term \"independent of the candidate or his or her agents or political committees authorized by such candidate pursuant to section 14-112 of the New York state election law\" shall mean that the candidate or his or her agents or political committees so authorized by such candidate did not authorize, request, suggest, foster or cooperate in any such activity; and provided further, that the term \"contribution\" shall not include:\n      (i) the value of services provided without compensation by individuals who volunteer a portion or all of their time on behalf of a candidate or political committee,\n      (ii) the use of real or personal property and the cost of invitations, food and beverages voluntarily provided by an individual to a candidate or political committee on the individual's residential premises for candidate-related activities to the extent such services do not exceed five hundred dollars in value, and\n      (iii) the travel expenses of any individual who on his or her own behalf volunteers his or her personal services to any candidate or political committee to the extent such expenses are unreimbursed and do not exceed five hundred dollars in value.\n      A loan made to a participating candidate or his or her principal committee, or a non-participating candidate or his or her authorized committees other than in the regular course of the lender's business shall be deemed, to the extent not repaid by the date of the first covered election in which such candidate is governed by this chapter following the date of the loan, a contribution by the lender. A loan made to a participating candidate or his or her principal committee, or a non-participating candidate or his or her authorized committees in the regular course of the lender's business shall be deemed, to the extent not repaid by the date of the first covered election in which the candidate is governed by this chapter following the date of the loan, a contribution by the obligor on the loan and by any other person endorsing, cosigning, guaranteeing, collateralizing or otherwise providing security for the loan. Childcare services for which the candidate has received an approved statement of campaign childcare eligibility, but for which there is no campaign expenditure, shall not be deemed an in-kind contribution if rendered below cost.\n      � 5.

Such adjusted expenditure limitation shall be in effect for any election held before the next such adjustment.\n      � 7.

Such disclosure software shall provide a notice to any user that enters an expenditure for childcare services, pursuant to subparagraph 13 of paragraph a of subdivision 21 of section 3-702, advising such user of the requirement to obtain an approved statement of campaign childcare eligibility prior to incurring such expenditures.\n      � 8.
