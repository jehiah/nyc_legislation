The number of times each establishment was the subject of an operation and the basis for each operation. \n      (d). The date and time of each operation, including the time each operation commenced and the average time spent inside each establishment, and whether the operation resulted in the closure of the establishment for the duration of the operation.\n      (e).

Any civil or criminal summonses as defined in section 14-101 of the administrative code, issued during an operation and the agency responsible for each such summons.\n      (g).

Whether the targeted establishment was ordered to cease operations as a result of an operation or enforcement actions taken as part of an operation, including the average duration of such closures.\n      (i). The number of written notices provided, as defined in section 14-181 of the administrative code, and the number of times, and reasons why, such written notice was not provided due to a law enforcement exception, as defined in section 14-181 of the administrative code. \n      3.

Such notice shall contain information about the alleged conduct or complaint that could warrant making such an establishment the subject of such an operation and provide a means for the establishment owner, or an agent acting on behalf of such establishment, to provide information or materials to the department relevant to the resolution or attempted resolution of the conduct or complaint described in the notice. Such notice shall include contact information for the office of nightlife and a notice that such recipient may contact such office with any questions or concerns.. The department shall make such written notice available to any establishment, upon request, during or immediately subsequent to an operation.   \n      b.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to create a private right of action on the part of any person or entity against the city of New York or any agency, official, or employee thereof, to enforce the provisions of this section.\n      c.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the city of New York or any agency, official, or employee thereof, from taking any action within its jurisdiction, including but not limited to enforcing any law, rule or regulation.  \n\t� 3.

Whether the targeted establishment was ordered to cease operations during such inspection, and the duration of such closure.\n      b. The term \"office of special enforcement\" means the office of special enforcement, as established under executive order number 96 for the year 2006, or such other agency as the mayor may designate by executive order.\n      � 2.
