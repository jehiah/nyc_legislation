Subdivision e of section 20-d of the New York city charter, as added by local law number 178 for the year 2017,  is amended to read as follows:\n      e. Reporting. 1. Within 18 months of the effective date of the local law that added this section, and annually thereafter, the director shall prepare and submit a report to the mayor and the speaker of the council that shall include, but not be limited to, the activities of the office and any recommendations developed by the director pursuant to this section.\n      2. The office shall submit to the council and post to the office's website, in a machine readable format, a report on multi-agency response to community hotspots operations consistent with paragraph 3 of this subdivision.
