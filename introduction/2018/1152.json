Affected City agencies would also have the discretion to extend the grace period by up to seven days.","TextID":70537,"Text":"Int.

Chapter 8 of title 23 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 23-806 to read as follows: \n      � 23-806 Online payment grace period. a. For the purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings:\n      Electronic system. The term \"electronic system\" means any website, network, online infrastructure or internally or externally accessible electronic systems constructed or maintained by or on behalf of the city.\n      Electronic system failure.
