The terms of office of the commission members expire on the day of the election at which the proposed new or revised charter prepared by the commission is submitted to the qualified electors of the city, or on the day of the second general election following the date of the enactment of this local law if no such questions have been submitted by that time.\n      ï¿½ 3. Commission mandate and powers. a. The commission shall review the entire charter and prepare a draft of a proposed new or revised charter.\n      b.

The commission shall maintain a website that includes its public hearing agendas and transcripts, as well as webcasts of its public hearings.\n      c. The commission shall have power to conduct private hearings, take testimony, subpoena witnesses, and require the production of books, papers, and records. \n      d. The city shall make appropriations for the support of the commission and the commission may accept any services, facilities, or funds and use or expend the same for its purposes.

No person is disqualified to serve as a commission employee or consultant by reason of holding any other public office or employment, nor shall they forfeit any such office or employment by reason of their appointment hereunder, notwithstanding the provisions of any law.\n      i. The commission shall be considered an agency for the purposes of article 6 of the public officers law.\n      ï¿½ 4. Submission of recommendation for voter approval. a. The commission may require that its proposed charter be submitted in two or more parts so arranged that corresponding parts of the existing charter shall remain in effect if one or more of such parts are not adopted, or may in lieu of a new charter submit a revision of the existing charter in one or more amendments and may also submit alternative charters or amendments or alternative provisions to supersede designated portions of a proposed charter or amendment if adopted.\n      b. The commission may submit its proposed new or revised charter to the electors of the city at a general or special election, and shall complete and file in the office of the city clerk its proposed new or revised charter in time for submission to the electors not later than the second general election after the date of the enactment of this local law.\n      ï¿½ 5.
