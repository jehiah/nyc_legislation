  "Summary": "This bill would allow an additional exception to the retail dealer cap put in place by Local Law 146-2017 by allowing owners of stores with tobacco retail dealer licenses to change business locations within the same community district without forfeiting their tobacco retail dealer license. The licensee could transfer the license to a new location only within the original community district, would have to stop selling tobacco products at the original location and would have to notify the Commissioner of Consumer Affairs 30 days before selling or offering tobacco products at the new location.",
