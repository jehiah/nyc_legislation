  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Chapter 21 of Title 21-A of the administrative code of the city of New York, as created by a local law for the year 2018 in relation to security cameras in New York city public schools, is amended by adding a new section 21-990 to read as follows: \n      ï¿½21-990. Door security in New York city public schools. a. Definitions.   For the purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings:\n      District 75 program.  The term \"district 75 program\" means a department of education program that provides educational, vocational, and behavioral support programs for students with severe disabilities from pre-kindergarten through age twenty-one.\n      b. Door alarms.  The department shall install door alarms at schools and consolidated school locations operated by the department of education where the chancellor, in consultation with the police department, deems such door alarms appropriate for security purposes.  Such door alarms may be placed at the discretion of the department at the exterior doors of school buildings, including buildings serving a district 75 program, and should provide an audible alert indicating unauthorized entry or departure from the school building.  Additionally, such alarm may be connected to and integrated into the surveillance camera system, where available, so that if a door alarm is activated a camera will automatically view and record such entrance for a minimum of ten minutes.\n      c. Door security assessment and reporting.  By January 31, 2019, and annually thereafter on or before January 31, the department, in consultation with the police department, shall submit a report to the speaker of the council on door security measures in public schools.  Such report shall include, but not be limited to, a summary of current practices for managing ingress and egress of school buildings, including a list of school buildings where door alarms have been installed, and an assessment of best practices related to the locking of exterior doors of school buildings and the use of technology, such as electronic keyless entry, intercom systems, and scan-in access, to assist in ensuring the secure management of school building entrances and exits.\n      ï¿½2.
