  "Summary": "This bill would require online short-term (less than 30 days) rental platforms that provide booking services for a fee to provide information about those transactions to the Mayor’s Office of Special Enforcement including:  \r\n•\tThe address of the short term rental;\r\n•\tThe name and address of the rental host;\r\n•\tThe URL of the short term rental listing;\r\n•\tWhether the short term rental was for the entire unit or part of it;\r\n•\tThe number of days the unit is rented;\r\n•\tThe fees collected by the online platform for booking services; and\r\n•\tInformation about rent collected by the booking service, where applicable.\r\n\r\nPlatforms that solely list or advertise offers for short-term rentals would not be required to report on such listings. \r\n\r\nAny personal information obtained by the City must be protected to the fullest extent of all relevant state, federal and local laws including, where applicable, the state Freedom of Information Law and local laws 245/2017 and 247/2017, and maintained, stored and handled in a manner consistent with such laws.    \r\n\r\nFailure to provide this information would result in a fine that is the greater of either $1,500 per listing for each reporting period in which the required information is not provided completely or accurately, or the total amount of the fees collected during the preceding year for transactions related to such listing, whichever is greater.",

A booking service shall periodically submit to the administering agency a report of transactions for which the booking service charged, collected or received a fee, directly or indirectly, for activity described in the definition of booking service. Each short-term rental associated with such fee is considered to be a separate transaction. The report shall be submitted in a time, manner and form established by such agency, including but not limited to, electronic submission in a format established by such agency. The report shall be submitted on a monthly basis, or less frequently as determined by such agency. Such report shall include the following information for each such transaction or, in instances where such information is unavailable to the booking service, an explanation of why such information is unavailable:\n      (1) The physical address of the short-term rental associated with such transaction, including the street name, street number, apartment or unit number, borough or county, and zip code;\n      (2) The full legal name, physical address, phone number and email address of the host of such short-term rental and the uniform resource locator (URL) and the individualized name and number of such host on such booking service's platform;\n      (3) The individualized name and number and the URL of such advertisement or listing;\n      (4) A statement as to whether such short-term rental transaction involved (i) short-term rental of the entirety of a dwelling unit or housing accommodations in a building or (ii) short-term rental of part of such unit or housing accommodations;\n      (5) The total number of days that the dwelling unit, part thereof or housing accommodations in a building were rented as a short-term rental through such booking service's platform; \n      (6) The total amount of fees received by such booking service for such short-term rental; and\n      (7) If such booking service collects rent for short-term rentals on behalf of such host, (i) the total amount of such rent received by such booking service and transmitted to such host and (ii) the account name and consistently anonymized identifier for the account number for the account used by such host to receive payments from such booking service or, if such booking service provides an explanation why such anonymized identifiers are unavailable, the account name and account number for such account.\n      b. A booking service shall obtain, from each host using such booking service to offer, manage or administer a short-term rental, lawful consent to provide the information described in subdivision a to the administering agency. Obtaining lawful consent may include, but is not limited to, advising or providing notice to a user of the booking service that new or continuing use of such booking service as a host constitutes consent to such disclosure. It shall not be a defense to a violation of subdivision a that the booking service did not obtain consent.\n      � 26-2103 Exemptions for certain class B multiple dwellings. The administering agency shall publish a list of class B multiple dwellings lawfully used for transient occupancy, as compiled by such agency. The provisions of subdivisions a and b of section 26-2102 shall not apply to short-term rental of a dwelling unit or part thereof or of housing accommodations within a building in a class B multiple dwelling on such published list. Such agency shall promulgate rules that (i) establish a process for an owner of a class B multiple dwelling to have such multiple dwelling included on such list and (ii) provide for the review and updating of such list no less than every six months. The administering agency shall revise such list when notified of an error by the department of buildings or other agency.\n      � 26-2104 Penalties. A booking service that fails to submit a report in compliance with subdivision a of section 26-2102 shall be liable for a civil penalty, to be assessed once per reporting period for each set of records corresponding to a listing which is missing, incomplete or inaccurate. The civil penalty shall not be more than the greater of $1,500 or the total fees collected during the preceding year by the booking service for transactions related to the listing. The civil penalties established by this section may be recovered in a proceeding before the office of administrative trials and hearings or a court of competent jurisdiction.\n      � 26-2105 Privacy. a. Information reported pursuant to section 26-2102 shall be available for public review only to the extent required by federal, state and local law.\n      b. The administering agency shall establish rules governing retention and disposal of information obtained pursuant to this chapter.\n      � 2.
