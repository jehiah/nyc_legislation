The commissioner shall adopt and implement rules designating at least six recyclable materials[, including plastic to the extent required in subdivision c of this section and yard waste to the extent required in section 16-308 of this chapter,] contained in department-managed solid waste and requiring households to source separate such designated materials.

The commissioner need not designate polystyrene that is laminated with non-polystyrene material or that is loose fill packaging.\n      � 2.
