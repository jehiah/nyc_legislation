  "Summary": "This bill would permit the Department of Buildings (DOB) to sanction registered design professionals who submit professionally certified applications for construction document approval within any 12-month period that contain errors that result in a stop work order.  It would also require that the DOB maintain a database in a non-proprietary machine-readable format that permits automatic processing, of registered design professionals who have been excluded, suspended or otherwise sanctioned by the DOB.",
