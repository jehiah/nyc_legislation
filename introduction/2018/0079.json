  "Summary": "Under the bill, the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) would be required to consider community impact when reviewing an application for a license to operate a livery base, black car base or luxury limousine base. The TLC would consider whether granting a base a license would cause a negative impact on quality of life in the community, including the potential impact on traffic congestion, sidewalk congestion and noise. In addition, the TLC would be required to submit base applications to the affected Council Member and Community Board, and consider any comments submitted by such Council Member or Community Board.",
