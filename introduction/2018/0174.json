  "Summary": "In order to better facilitate communication between city residents and the NYC Department of Transportation, this bill would require the Department to mark new parking and traffic signs with a notification sign that says new, in capital letters, on a mounted metal sign. The notification would remain in place for at least 30 days and to create awareness, the current grace period given for parking violations issued in an area affected by the new restriction would be extended from five days to seven.",
