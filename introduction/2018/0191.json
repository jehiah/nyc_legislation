  "Summary": "This law would require the department of health and mental hygiene to make automatic external defibrillators available to primary, intermediate and high schools that do not already receive such devices. An automated external defibrillator is a device that can stop irregular heart rhythms or restart a heart after sudden cardiac arrest by conveying an electronic shock to the heart (through the chest).",

Nothing contained in this section shall impose any duty or obligation on any person to provide assistance with an automated external defibrillator to a victim of a medical emergency.\n      e. Any person who, in accordance with the provisions of this section, voluntarily and without expectation of monetary compensation renders first aid or emergency treatment using an automated external defibrillator that has been made available pursuant to this section, to a person who is unconscious, ill or injured, and any person, agency, school or other entity that acquires or makes available an automated external defibrillator pursuant to this section, shall be entitled to the limitation of liability provided in section 3000-a of the New York state public health law.\n                     f.
