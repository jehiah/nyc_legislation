  "Summary": "This bill would require prominent signage within runaway and homeless youth (RHY) services funded by the Department of Youth and Community Development (DYCD) indicating where to call 24 hours a day with questions, comments or complaints regarding RHY services. The signage would include where to find rules governing RHY service and participant conduct and phone numbers to access mental health resources 24 hours a day. DYCD would annually report the number of RHY questions, comments and complaints received and their general nature, such as facility conditions, lack of resources, failure to provide information required by law and treatment by RHY staff or service participants. DYCD would also indicate the status of its responses to and any RHY service changes made as a result of reported calls.",
