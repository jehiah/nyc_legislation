The bill would also create a one-year, seven-member taskforce on health and safety in nail salons, with four members appointed by the Mayor, two by the Speaker of the Council, and one by the Public Advocate. It would be required to issue a report relating to a variety of nail salons health and safety issues, and recommendations for improving health and safety in nail salons.",
