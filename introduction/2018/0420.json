  "Summary": "This bill would require the Parks Department (DPR) to test for lead concentration levels in areas of parks under DPR jurisdiction that contain exposed soil and are used for active play or passive recreation whenever a capital project occurs in such area.  Where the test indicates that a bare soil area has a lead level at or above the level set forth in title 40 of the code of federal regulations (currently 400 parts per million), DPR must cover, replace or otherwise remediate the lead level in the area.",
