More than 10 percent of exonerations have come from New York State. Those New Yorkers spent an average of 9.18 years in prison for crimes they did not commit. Exonerees face many of the same hurdles as other released prisoners, including obtaining housing, employment and medical care. However, exonerees are often ineligible for reentry services that states provide to parolees and released prisoners. Wrongful convictions also take an economic and emotional toll on the families of the accused. Under New York State law, compensation for wrongful conviction and imprisonment does not include the provision of social services.  This bill would require the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice (MOCJ) to coordinate with relevant City agencies to promote the availability of social services for wrongfully convicted individuals and their immediate family members. MOCJ would also be required to develop methods to increase the coordination of such social services, and provide outreach and education on the availability of such services for exonerees and their immediate family members.","LastModified":"2021-02-02T15:20:56.9Z"}

The Department of Transportation is currently required to arrive at intersections and access traffic control signals within two hours of a reported outage or malfunction, but not to implement alternative traffic control measures unless signal repair or replacement will take greater than twenty-four hours. Requiring the placement of temporary signage within an hour rather than waiting up to twenty-four hours for alternative traffic control measures could significantly reduce the risk of pedestrian injury and vehicular collisions at intersections with malfunctioning traffic control signals.","LastModified":"2021-04-30T15:57:53.293Z"}

Since 2012, the New York City Department of Transportation (DOT) and Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) have collaborated on a component of BRT called Traffic Signal Priority (TSP). TSP is a technology that is capable of enhancing traditional transit services by facilitating bus movements through intersections controlled by traffic signals. Since June 2017, TSP is active at 260 intersections on five bus routes. \r\n\r\nDue to the myriad of transportation issues facing New Yorkers, this proposed local law would require DOT, to the extent practicable in cooperation with relevant city and state agencies including the MTA, to upgrade at least ten bus routes per year over the next four years to TSP. This would double their current planned pace.","LastModified":"2021-04-30T17:30:17.987Z"}

The distractions associated with these competing duties could lead to traffic violations, accidents and even injuries for passengers, other vehicles and pedestrians alike. Moreover, these distractions and safety concerns may be more pronounced for double decker tour buses because they accommodate twice as many passengers on separate levels. This law would require double decker sight-seeing tour buses to have at least one licensed employee present on the upper level of the bus in addition to the driver at all times when passengers are present on the upper level.

Existing law only allows newsstand operators to hold their license in their personal capacity.  The bill also contains deeming provisions that would help the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) to enforce a limit on two newsstand locations per licensee. This bill would also prohibit any licensee from renting or attempting to rent out their newsstand; doing so would be a basis for license revocation. Finally, the bill also requires DCWP to mail current newsstand licensees, before their next license renewal, a letter explaining important legal requirements that may be applicable if holding a newsstand license as a corporate entity.  Additionally, Section 20-241 would be repealed and subsequent sections in the subchapter renumbered, to consolidate the requirements and protections in the subchapter.","LastModified":"2021-11-30T05:20:15.717Z"}

The Council finds that some landlords and property owners discriminate against New York City police officers who are accompanied by their police work dogs by considering the dogs pets rather than working animals. Accordingly, it is necessary to amend the City's Human Rights Law to protect police officers in the K-9 unit from such housing and public accommodations discrimination. \r\n\r\nThis bill prohibits housing discrimination against persons accompanied by a police dog. This includes discrimination in refusing to sell, rent, lease, approve the sale, rental or lease or otherwise deny to or withhold housing accommodations or an interest therein and in the publication or advertisement of housing accommodations.","LastModified":"2021-02-17T18:49:04.793Z"}

The new criteria would prohibit siting a city facility, including emergency contracted facilities, in any community district highly concentrated with such facilities. High concentration means the top 10% of community districts with the highest ratios of capacity of similar facilities to district population. An agency proposing a siting could overcome the prohibition by demonstrating the facility serves particular needs of the community, except where need was created by unfair overconcentration of similar existing facilities. Sitings exempted from the prohibition based on need would be subject to a recorded vote by the CPC and subsequent Council review. Prohibited sitings would be reported to the Council, and the status of sitings made under the need-based exemption would be tracked on an online database updated annually.","LastModified":"2021-02-17T18:49:14.56Z"}

Pay disparity can be based on gender, race, age, or any other protected class enumerated in the City’s Human Rights Law.  The Administration, through the Mayor’s Office of Data Analytics (MODA), will be required to report on an annual basis, aggregated data from every City agency looking at gender, ethnicity and race and $2.5K, $5K and $10K pay bands to find instances of pay disparities. After receiving the data from DCAS, MODA shall issue a report to the mayor and the speaker no later than May 31st annually. This report shall aggregate data from each agency showing the frequency of full- and part-time and seasonal employees by agency, EEO-4 job group, pay band ($10K) and racial group and gender. This same report will be posted publicly on the MODA website and the Open NY website.  The Council, on an annual basis, will be given 90 day access through a computer application to employment level data for all City workers to conduct its own analysis.","LastModified":"2021-04-01T15:13:50.723Z"}

Under this legislation, DOHMH or another relevant city agency would be required to inspect not just the dwelling unit where a poisoned child resides, but also any daycare, preschool, or nursery school where the child routinely spends 10 or more hours per week, as well as any park or playground where DOHMH determines that bare soil presents a potential source of lead exposure. DOHMH would also be required to inspect any apartment with a child under 1 in the same building as the dwelling unit where a poisoned child resides. These inspections would include analysis by an x-ray fluorescence analyzer (XRF) of all friction surfaces, chewable surfaces and impact surfaces, as well as assisting with the ordering of a free water test kit and testing of soil from any area on the property covered in bare soil that may be a potential source of lead exposure. When DOHMH issues an order to abate a lead paint hazard, landlords would be required to report XRF results for all surfaces in a unit to the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) within 60 days. DOHMH or another relevant city agency would be required to notify all residents of the building that a lead hazard was identified, and to provide specific notice to residents of units it intends to inspect, as well as refer these residents to resources to learn more about their rights under the city’s lead laws. This legislation also requires that DOHMH provide information regarding special education services available from the department of education to the parent or guardian of any child under the age of 18 determined to have an elevated blood lead level.","LastModified":"2021-06-03T15:45:11.58Z"}

First, this bill would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to add certain information regarding lead dust hazards to existing pamphlets. This bill would also expand existing DOHMH referral procedures where a child may have been exposed to lead to automatically refer such child to a medical provider for blood lead testing, regardless of whether a referral is requested by a parent or guardian. This bill would also require DOHMH to post a notice in the lobby of a building when, in the course of completing certain inspections, a lead hazard has been discovered in the common area. Building owners would be required to post additional notices on every floor. This bill would also require statements of compliance with lead safe work practices as a condition of certain permit applications, and would require the Department of Buildings (DOB) to maintain records of all such permits. This bill would add lead safe work practices to the requirements of a Tenant Protection Plan, while also allowing DOB to issue a stop work order where DOHMH has made a referral based on unsafe lead work practices. Where DOB receives a complaint alleging the violation of the lead safe practices described in a tenant protection plan, this bill would require DOB to inspect within 24 hours, take dust wipes upon inspection, and refer such dust wipes and any hazardous conditions to DOHMH for inspection and analysis.","LastModified":"2021-06-22T15:43:22.697Z"}

The plan would be portable so when employees switch jobs they can continue to contribute or roll over their accounts into other retirement savings plans. Employers would not contribute on behalf of employees.","LastModified":"2021-07-15T18:58:17.103Z"}

The term “X” means a gender that is not exclusively male or female.  Currently, individuals requesting to correct the gender on their birth certificates must submit affidavits from licensed physicians or medical professionals attesting that the changed sex designation more accurately reflects the applicant’s gender identity.","LastModified":"2021-04-16T15:52:34.26Z"}

Owners who receive a red light or speed camera violation will be notified that those violations will count toward dangerous vehicle abatement program. After receiving notice that a vehicle is covered under the program, an owner will have the opportunity to contest. Defenses will include that: (1) another person was driving the vehicle and will take the course, (2) the vehicle hasn’t accrued a sufficient number of tickets, (3) the owner was not able to enroll in the course, through no fault of their own, and (4) personal circumstances beyond the control of the owner would cause undue hardship and prevent them from completing the course.  The program will run for three years. Each year, DOT will report on the number of drivers of who completed the course and the number of vehicles impounded. At least three months before the end of the program, DOT will issue a report on the effectiveness of the program and how certain driving behaviors correlate with traffic crashes.","LastModified":"2021-04-16T15:52:40.07Z"}

The Coordinator would then be required to identify designated organizations to provide legal representation and establish the pilot program by September 1, 2022, ensuring that such pilot would cover all associated filing fees. The working group would then produce two subsequent reports: (1) a progress report on the number and types of cases and fees, to be submitted by April 1, 2023, and (2) a final report with additional assessments of the pilot and recommendations for potentially expanding the pilot, to be completed by November 1, 2024.

A number of new permits, now referred to as supervisory licenses, would be issued in batches each year beginning in 2022 until 2032. The new supervisory licenses require at least one supervisory licensee to be present at a pushcart at all times. This new requirement will not be applied to existing permits until 2032, at which time a supervisory licensee must be present at any cart to operate. The bill will also create a new dedicated vending law enforcement unit, which would exclusively enforce vending laws. It would focus on areas of the City with known vending enforcement challenges, but will respond to vending complaints and violations throughout the City. The bill would also create a street vendor advisory board, to assess the effectiveness of the enforcement unit and the roll-out of new permits, and examine and make recommendations pertaining to vending laws.","LastModified":"2021-03-30T15:02:11.29Z"}

This bill would require the City to study the issue of off-hour deliveries to City facilities and develop a framework for the implementation of such deliveries at City facilities in the central business district (Manhattan south of 60th Street) and at least two highly congested areas outside of the central business district. The City would then have to implement off-hour deliveries where feasible, starting with Manhattan south of Canal Street and then expanding to the rest of the central business district and other highly congested areas.

The installment amounts are then calculated based on the amount owed, interest rates, and pay-off period, but without regard for income or ability to pay.  This local law would create three income-based installment agreements for eligible one- to three- family and condominium property owners where such property is the primary residence. All three installment agreements would be available only to property owners with combined incomes of $58,399 or less. The senior low-income installment agreement would allow property owners who are at least 65 years old to defer payment of a percentage of their tax arrears and prospective tax liability until the termination of the installment agreement upon expiration, death, or transfer. The fixed-length income-based installment agreement would allow property owners to pay off tax arrears and one year of prospective tax liability by paying installments based on a percentage of income until the debt is repaid. Finally, the extenuating circumstances income-based installment agreement would allow property owners with extenuating circumstances (such as loss of income due to unemployment, death, treatment of an illness, military service, or involuntary absence) to enter into a one-year installment agreement to pay off tax arrears and property taxes that accrue during that year by paying installments based on a percentage of income. A property that is the subject of one of the installment agreements would be exempt from the tax lien sale. The current ten-year, zero down payment plan would continue to exist alongside these new payment plan options.","LastModified":"2019-05-29T20:12:02.94Z"}
