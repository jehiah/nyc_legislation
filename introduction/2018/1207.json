  "Summary": "This bill would require the Office of Labor Standards, in consultation with other appropriate agencies, to submit a report to the Mayor and the Council, and post on its website, a report on the gender pay gap among teenagers. The report would include information about trends and solutions relating to the pay gap, how the pay gap among teenagers may lead to larger gaps in the labor force overall, lifetime earnings for women and lost earnings due to pay inequality. The report would also make recommendations for addressing pay inequality for teenage women and disadvantages experienced by teenage women, the development of best practices to ensure better pay for teenage women, and increasing awareness of teenage women on pay rates and employment rights.",
