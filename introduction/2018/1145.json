  "Summary": "This bill would exempt retail stores from the item pricing requirement of the truth-in-pricing law where consumers can access price scanners. Stores with scanners would not be required to label or tag the price of each item individually or on the shelf. Instead, retail stores could provide a bar code on the item which consumers could use at a scanner to ascertain the price of the item. The proportion of scanners would be based on the size of the store as determined by the Commissioner of Consumer of Affairs.",
