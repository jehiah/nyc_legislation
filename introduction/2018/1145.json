  "Summary": "This bill would exempt grocery stores and other retailers that sell stock keeping units (“SKUs”) from being required to label each of the items they sell with a price sticker, under certain conditions. Under this bill, any stock keeping item that is able to be scanned by a price scanner; and is sold in a retail store with a sufficient number of clearly marked and functioning price scanners for consumer use, that are placed in adequate locations, would be exempt from the item pricing requirement. The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection would be required to promulgate rules that further specify these conditions.",
