  "Summary": "This bill would require anyone renting a truck to prove their identity to the owner in person. Renters would be required to present their driver’s license to the owner for verification, and owners would be required to verify the signature on the driver’s license with the signature of the renter written in the owner’s presence. Vans and sport utility vehicles that can transport 10 or more passengers or weigh 6,000 pounds or more would also be covered under this requirement. The penalty for violating any of these requirements would be a fine of not more than $250, imprisonment for not more than ten days, or both.",
