  "Summary": "In order to ensure adequate oversight of massage therapy businesses in the city, this local law would require massage therapy businesses to apply for and receive from the Department of Consumer Affairs a license in order to operate in the city. This bill would also ensure that any person applying for a massage therapy business license is employing practitioners who are licensed pursuant to state education law.",
