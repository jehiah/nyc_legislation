The board would consist of three members, who are appointed by the Mayor.

The board would work with the Comptroller—who is responsible for managing trust funds held by the City, such as the pension funds—to select the investment strategies and policies. The board would be required to report annually on its activities and actions.  The bill would take effect in 90 days, however, the board would have up to two years to implement the program.",

Subject to applicable federal and state law,  including its duties as a fiduciary, the board may:\n      a. After consultation with the comptroller, determine the date upon which the program established pursuant to this chapter shall become operational and begin accepting contributions from participants, provided that such date shall be no later than two calendar years after the effective date of this chapter, unless the board determines that a further delay is reasonably necessary to ensure the effective operation of the program. The board shall provide notice of such determination to delay the program to the mayor, comptroller, and speaker no later than 90 days prior to two calendar years after the effective date of this chapter and shall indicate what conditions contribute to such determination and an approximation of the additional time required to ensure effective operation of the program, provided, however, that such time shall not be longer than six calendar months or an additional notice shall be required prior to the end of such time indicating the present circumstances and providing an updated date for the program to become operational.   \n      b.

Establish a process by which an employer that is not a covered employer may voluntarily offer the program to its employees and allow those employees to enroll in and contribute to the program.\n      n. Establish a process by which a covered employer may seek a hardship exemption from this chapter, which may be obtained by demonstrating to the board's satisfaction that participation would be unduly burdensome for the employer. \n      o. Establish a process by which participating employers who cease to be covered employers, for example, by offering the New York State Secure Choice Program to their employees, may discontinue their participation in the program. \n      p.

Establish procedures and requirements, which may apply to participating employers and any other employer as defined in subdivision 3 of section 190 of the labor law, to enable the board, or the enforcement agency designated pursuant to section 20-1414, to ascertain whether such an employer is subject to the provisions of this chapter.\n      r.

Establish an investment strategy and policy, provided that such strategy and policy shall be subject to the approval of the board. The underlying investments or investment funds selected or authorized pursuant to this section to implement such strategy, policy, and investment options shall be diversified by the comptroller consistent with such strategy and policy so as to minimize the risk of large losses under the circumstances. The comptroller may, at any time, modify such strategy, policy, and investment options, subject to the approval of the board.  \n      b. Direct the underlying investments or investment funds implementing the investment policy and strategy and investment options established pursuant to subdivision a of this section. Such underlying investments may include, without limitation, shares of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, publicly-traded equity and fixed-income securities, and other investments available for investment by the program. When selecting and authorizing such investments, the comptroller shall consult with the board and any person retained by the board pursuant to section 20-1405 and shall, not less than once every quarter and prior to any meeting of the board that may be scheduled during such quarter pursuant to subdivision e of section 20-1402, issue a report to the board describing its activities undertaken pursuant to this section and the performance of the investments or investment funds selected or authorized pursuant to this section. The comptroller shall respond within a reasonable time to any questions raised by the board about such report. \n      c. Enter into any contracts, agreements, or arrangements, as the comptroller may deem appropriate, with any person deemed qualified by the comptroller to assist in the selection and authorization of investments or to provide such investments or investment management services.

The board and the comptroller may each promulgate rules to implement the provisions of this chapter concerning their respective powers.\n      a. Such rules may establish variations from the requirements otherwise established by this chapter in order to ensure that this program does not conflict with, and is not otherwise preempted by, state or federal law, including the employee retirement income security act of 1974, and to ensure that this program does not constitute an employee benefit plan under such act, provided that such variations are not inconsistent with the overall purpose and policy of this chapter. \n      b. Such rules may include any provisions necessary to ensure exemption from the employee retirement income security act of 1974. \n      � 20-1410 No guarantees permitted; potential losses. Except as otherwise required by federal or state law, no person including, but not limited to, a participating employer, any person retained by the board pursuant to section 20-1405, a member of the retirement savings board, the board itself, the comptroller, any person retained by the comptroller pursuant to section 20-1406, the city, or any representative of any of the preceding shall guarantee a rate of return or interest for any contribution made to the retirement savings program.
