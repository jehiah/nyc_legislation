  "Summary": "This bill would Require DOHMH to investigate the potential sources of elevated blood lead levels in children, including an inspection of any dwelling where a child with an elevated blood lead level spends 10 or more hours per week. This bill would also add to existing lead hazard remediation requirements for facilities providing day care services, requiring them to post notices describing any order to remediate a lead hazard, and to remediate such hazard within 21 days.  This bill would also implicate a building owner’s responsibility to investigate and remediate a lead hazard when a child spends 10 or more hours per week in one of their units.",

The presumption established by this section may be rebutted by the operator [or owner] of the [day care facility] covered facility or by the owner of the premises where such facility is located by submitting to the department a sworn written statement by [the] such operator or owner [of the day care facility] supported by lead-based paint testing or sampling results, a sworn written statement by the person who performed the testing if performed by an employee or agent of [the] such operator or owner [of the day care facility,] and such other proof as the department may require.

In the event such order is not complied with within [forty-five] 21 days [of] after service thereof, the department shall immediately request an agency of the city of New York to execute such order pursuant to the provisions of section 17-147 of this code. The agency shall execute the order within [forty-five] 21 days of the department's request. Where compliance with the time requirements of this subdivision would cause undue hardship, and where the operator demonstrates a good faith effort to comply timely and shows that it is maintaining interim controls to protect children from a lead-based paint hazard, the department may extend the time for compliance for an additional 24 days. The department may extend the time for compliance beyond such additional 24 days, in accordance with rules promulgated by the department. The city of New York shall be entitled to enforce its rights for reimbursement of expenses incurred thereby, including as credits toward lease payments. \n      e.
