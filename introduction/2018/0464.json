This bill would also add to existing lead hazard remediation requirements for facilities providing day care services, requiring them to post notices describing any order to remediate a lead hazard, and to remediate such hazard within 21 days.  This bill would also implicate a building owner’s responsibility to investigate and remediate a lead hazard when a child spends 10 or more hours per week in one of their units.","TextID":66054,"Text":"Int.
