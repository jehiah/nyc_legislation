The commissioner, in consultation with the commissioner of health and mental hygiene, shall develop an air quality monitoring program pursuant to which the department shall monitor the air quality in the vicinity of any wastewater treatment plant operated by the department. \n      b. The program shall annually measure and record the levels of air pollutants that are hazardous to human health, including but not limited to gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrogen sulfide, and pathogenic airborne microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, protozoa, or parasites.
