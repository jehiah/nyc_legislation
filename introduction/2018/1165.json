  "Summary": "This bill would require an air quality monitoring program around wastewater treatment plants operated by DEP. The program would monitor hazardous air pollutants in the vicinity of the plants, including but not limited to greenhouse gases and airborne microorganisms.  This bill would require DEP to report the program’s findings to the Council annually and post the report on the DEP website.",

The commissioner, in consultation with the commissioner of health and mental hygiene, shall develop an air quality monitoring program pursuant to which the department shall monitor the air quality in the vicinity of any wastewater treatment plant operated by the department. \n      b. The program shall annually measure and record the levels of air pollutants that are hazardous to human health, including but not limited to gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrogen sulfide, and pathogenic airborne microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, protozoa, or parasites.  Where, due to conditions unique to a particular wastewater treatment plant the commissioner believes other hazardous air pollutants may have been released into the air, the commissioner shall also monitor the air for such other pollutants.\n      c. The commissioner shall report findings of the program for each wastewater treatment plant to the Council on an annual basis.
