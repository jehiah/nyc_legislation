  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to provide opioid overdose prevention and reversal training to the public. DOHMH already provides such trainings, but this law would codify existing trainings and ensure they occur as long as necessary to combat the City’s opioid epidemic.",
