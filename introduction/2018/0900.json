  "Summary": "Proposed Int. No. 900-A would amend Local Law 27 of 2015 to require the Department of Education to report quarterly, rather than annually, on its provision of special education services in compliance with students’ IEPs. The bill would also add “assistive technology services” and “special transportation services” to the enumerated list of services that students with disabilities are entitled to on which DOE is required to annually report.",
