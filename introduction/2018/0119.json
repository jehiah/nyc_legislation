  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n      Section 1.  Chapter 1 of title 18 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 18-154 to read as follows:\n      �18-154 Drinking fountains and parks. a. For purposes of this section, \"greenstreets\" shall mean a location under the jurisdiction of the commissioner that is used as a pedestrian thoroughfare that is not inside of or adjacent to a park.\n      b. The commissioner shall on a regular basis, beginning on January 1, 2019 and no less than every five years thereafter, complete an evaluation of the need for drinking fountains on locations under the jurisdiction of the commissioner, that are adjacent to non-park land, including both greenstreets and the perimeters of public parks. Such evaluation shall consider both the proximity of existing sources of public drinking water and how heavily trafficked such locations are by pedestrians and bicyclists. At the conclusion of each evaluation, the commissioner shall report to the council on the seventy-five such locations, as identified by the commissioner, that would most benefit from the installation of drinking fountains for public use.\n      c. Prior to July 1, 2019, no less than twenty-five drinking fountains available for public use shall be installed and maintained at locations identified by the commissioner in the report issued pursuant to subdivision b of this section. Every five years hence, the department shall install and maintain no less than twenty-five additional drinking fountains for public use, at locations identified by the commissioner pursuant to subdivision b. Anytime after July 2, 2029, the commissioner may determine not to install any further drinking fountains under this section and shall inform the speaker of the council in writing of such determination and the reasons therefor. \n      �2.
