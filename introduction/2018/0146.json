The bill would also require that the maximum rent toward which rental assistance vouchers may be applied annually increases at the same rate as levels equal to those established pursuant to section 982.503 of the Code of Federal Regulations, otherwise referred to as “Section 8.” The requirements set by the bill would be subject to appropriation.","TextID":70236,"Text":"Int.
