  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Subdivision b of section 17-194 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by a local law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, relating to requiring the visual documentation of water tanks during inspections, to be submitted to the department of health and mental hygiene, as proposed in introduction number 1169-A for the year 2018, is amended to read as follows:\n       b. Any owner of a building that has a water tank as part of its drinking water supply system shall have such water tank inspected at least once annually. Such inspection shall ensure that the water tank complies with all provisions of the administrative code of the city of New York, the construction codes of the city of New York and the health code of the city of New York. The results of such inspection shall be recorded in a manner prescribed by the commissioner. Such results shall be maintained by the owner and by the water tank inspector for at least five years from the date of inspection and shall be made available to the department upon request within five business days. An owner shall ensure that documentation of such annual inspection shall be submitted to the department by the water tank inspector, in a form and manner prescribed by the department. Such documentation shall state whether or not all applicable requirements were met at the time of inspection and provide a description of any non-compliance with applicable requirements. Such documentation shall include visual depictions, such as photographs or videos, which display the interior and exterior of the water tank. The department may require an owner to conduct additional inspections and provide any additional documentation, including receipts of work orders, or visual depictions such as photographs or videos. The department may require that any document submitted to the department pursuant to this section be submitted electronically.\n      � 2. This local law takes effect on the same date as a local law amending the administrative code of the city of New York, relating to qualifications for persons conducting inspections and maintenance on drinking water tanks, as proposed in introduction number 1157-A for the year 2018, takes effect, except that the commissioner may take such actions as are necessary for the implementation of this local law, including the promulgation of rules, before such date.\n      \n\n\n\n\n\nSIL\nLS #7163\n03/20/19 6:45pm\n\n      1\n      \n      \n      2",
