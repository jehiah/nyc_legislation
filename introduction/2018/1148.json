  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Education (DOE) to report twice a year on how school bus routes are determined, goals for time limits for bus routes, and any other goals relating to school bus services. This bill would also require DOE to report twice a year a list of school bus vendors who completed a dry run of their route as required by their contract, and those bus vendors who are not in compliance with their contractual obligations to complete dry runs. The bill would also require DOE to share with parents and guardians before the start of the school year their child’s bus route, scheduled arrival and departure times, the vendor assigned to such route, how a parent can appeal or make a request about the route, and information that relates to pre-k students receiving school bus services. The bill would also require DOE to let parents know daily if their child’s bus is late arriving or departing school.",
