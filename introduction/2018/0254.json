  "Summary": "This legislation, if enacted, would require the Commissioner of the Department of Sanitation to submit a report to the Mayor and the City Council by January 1, 2018 that would detail its plan to accept commercial putrescible and non-putrescible waste at the city’s four marine transfer stations.  The report would be required to include the date at which each marine transfer station would begin accepting such waste, the department’s efforts in attracting to each marine transfer station and whether the tipping fees associated with such waste would be subsidized in whole or in part by the City.   The legislation would also require that by March 1, 2020, and annually thereafter, DSNY submit a report on implementation of the plan, including the amount of commercial waste processed at each transfer station in the previous calendar year.",
