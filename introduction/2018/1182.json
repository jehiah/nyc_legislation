  "Summary": "The proposed local law would amend Title 24 of the administrative code is amended by adding a new section 24-806.1 to require the department to review the opportunities to generate solar or wind energy from vacant and underutilized sites including closed and capped landfills and brownfields. This local law would also require that the department undertake a feasibility study, including a cost benefit analysis.  A draft of the study must be submitted to the mayor and the speaker of the council on or before September 30, 2019.  A final study with recommendations for generation solar or wind energy from vacant and underutilized sites including closed and capped landfills and brownfields must be submitted to the mayor and the speaker of the council by December 31, 2019.  If there are no recommendations made with respect to the opportunities to generate solar or wind energy from vacant and underutilized sites the department would be required to undertake another study in three years to examine this issue again and ascertain whether generation of solar or wind energy from vacant and underutilized sites including closed and capped landfills and brownfields in New York City is more feasible at that time.",

On or before December 31, 2019, and every three years thereafter, the department shall submit to the mayor and council a report identifying all vacant and underutilized municipally-owned sites that would be suitable for the development of renewable energy.
