The new criteria would prohibit siting a city facility, including emergency contracted facilities, in any community district highly concentrated with such facilities. High concentration means the top 10% of community districts with the highest ratios of capacity of similar facilities to district population. An agency proposing a siting could overcome the prohibition by demonstrating the facility serves particular needs of the community, except where need was created by unfair overconcentration of similar existing facilities. Sitings exempted from the prohibition based on need would be subject to a recorded vote by the CPC and subsequent Council review. Prohibited sitings would be reported to the Council, and the status of sitings made under the need-based exemption would be tracked on an online database updated annually.","TextID":61497,"Text":"Int.

For any otherwise prohibited facility siting or expansion that proceeds pursuant to paragraph 4 of this subdivision, the commission shall issue and file with the council and the affected borough president a written statement indicating:\n      (a) The vote of each member of the commission, or if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact; and\n      (b) How the proposed siting meets the requirements of paragraph 4 of this subdivision.\n      6. Actions taken by the commission pursuant to paragraph 4 of this subdivision are subject to council review pursuant to section 197-d. \n      7. The commission shall establish and maintain a publicly accessible online database to track the status of any facility siting made pursuant to paragraph 4 of this subdivision.\n      (a) The commission shall record such sitings in the database within 30 days of final approval of a siting proposal and shall update the progress towards the opening of such facility if new, or the expansion of such facility if an existing facility, not less than annually thereafter. The record of each siting in such database shall include the application number of the related city-sponsored facility proposal and the date such proposal was finally approved. \n      (b) Beginning June 30, 2019, and annually thereafter, the commission shall report to the mayor, the council, the borough presidents and the community boards a listing of any prohibited facility siting that does not progress or that is sited in an alternative location based upon a demonstration made pursuant to paragraph 4 of this subdivision.\n      � 3.

Such procurement shall be made with such competition as is practicable under the circumstances, consistent with the provisions of section [three hundred seventeen] 317 of this chapter; and \n      2. In the case of procuring or significantly expanding the use of any facility subject to the criteria established pursuant to section 203, such procurement or significant expansion shall be made consistent with any prohibition against locating or expanding that facility in any of the top 10 percent of community districts that have the highest ratios of facility capacity to district resident population as prescribed by the process set forth in section 203. \n      b. A written determination of the basis for the emergency and the selection of the contractor shall be placed in the agency contract file, and shall further be submitted to the council no later than [fifteen] 15 days following contract award, and the determination or summary of such determination shall be included in the notice of the award of contract published pursuant to section [three hundred twenty-five] 325 of this chapter.\n      � 4.
