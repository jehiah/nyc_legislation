Section 8-101 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 1 for the year 2016, is amended to read as follows: \n      � 8-101 Policy.\n      In the city of New York, with its great cosmopolitan population, there is no greater  danger to the health, morals, safety and welfare of the  city and its inhabitants than the existence of groups prejudiced against  one another and antagonistic to each other because of  their  actual  or  perceived differences, including those based on race, color, creed, age,  national   origin,   alienage  or  citizenship  status,  gender,  sexual  orientation, disability, marital status, partnership  status,  caregiver  status,  sexual and reproductive health decisions, uniformed  service,  any  lawful  source of income, status as a  victim of domestic violence or status as a victim  of  sex  offenses  or  stalking,  whether  children  are,  may  be  or would be residing with a  person or conviction or arrest record.  The  council  hereby  finds  and  declares  that  prejudice,  intolerance,  bigotry,  and  discrimination,  bias-related violence or  harassment  and  disorder  occasioned  thereby  threaten  the rights and proper privileges of its inhabitants and menace  the institutions and foundation of a free democratic state. The council further finds and declares that gender-based harassment threatens the terms, conditions and privileges of employment. A city agency is  hereby  created  with power to eliminate and prevent discrimination from playing  any role in actions relating to employment, public  accommodations,  and  housing  and  other  real  estate,  and  to  take  other actions against  prejudice, intolerance, bigotry, discrimination, sexual  harassment  and  bias-related  violence or harassment  as  herein  provided;  and  the  commission established hereunder is hereby  given  general  jurisdiction  and power for such purposes.\n      � 2.
