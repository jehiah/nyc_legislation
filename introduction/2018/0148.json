  "Summary": "Some youths who have spent time in foster care have difficulty obtaining stable housing; many youths end up “couchsurfing,” in homeless shelters, or in the corrections system. Additionally, according to a report from a local advocacy organization, homeless mothers are more likely to have spent time in foster care. This bill would allow youths who have spent time in foster care to be eligible for rental assistance vouchers that would allow them to obtain stable housing. Eligibility would be limited to those 24 years old or younger.",
