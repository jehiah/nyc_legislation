  "Summary": "This legislation would require the Department of Homeless Services (DHS) to provide written notification to shelter residents at least 48 hours prior to any non-emergency shelter transfer. The notification would include a detailed summary of reasons for the transfer, the name and address of the shelter the client is being transferred to, and language about how a client can obtain a copy of their case record. The legislation would also require that the same information be provided to clients affected by emergency transfers no later than 48 hours after the emergency transfer. The legislation would require DHS to submit an annual report on the number of emergency transfers and non-emergency transfers, disaggregated by the shelter type and the reason for transfers.",
