  "Summary": "This bill would require owners of multiple dwellings to annually inspect soil in areas on the premises of a multiple dwelling, partially or wholly covered in soil and accessible to persons other than those employed to maintain such premises. If the lead level of that soil is above the soil lead reference level, the owner must notify the Department of Housing Preservation and Development and cover, replace or remediate that area. The Department of Health and Mental Hygiene may reduce the frequency of the sampling to every three years, if for each of the immediately preceding three years, the results indicate that the lead levels were below the soil lead reference levels.",
