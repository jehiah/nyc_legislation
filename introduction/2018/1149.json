  "Summary": "This bill would require the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to send owners and operators of cooling towers an electronic reminder prior to the filing deadline for annual certifications with a link to where these certifications can be submitted. This bill would also require cooling tower inspectors to report to DOHMH in real time when certain inspections occur. Finally, this bill would require building owners to make cooling tower inspection results available to the public.",
