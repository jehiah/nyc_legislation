  "Summary": "The number of gas service stations appears to be declining in the city, especially in Brooklyn and Queens, creating more difficulties for motorists seeking locations where they can fuel their vehicles. This bill would require the Department of Consumer Affairs to conduct a study on the decline of the number of these gas service stations in the city and to explore and make recommendations for reducing or preventing further decline in the number of such stations.",
