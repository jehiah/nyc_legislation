Such means and methods shall be described with particularity and in no case shall terms such as \"code compliant,\" \"approved,\" \"legal,\" \"protected in accordance with law\" or similar terms be used as a substitute for such description. The tenant protection plan must be site specific. The elements of the tenant protection plan may vary depending on the nature and scope of the work but at a minimum, must comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including the New York city construction codes, the New York city housing maintenance code, the New York city noise control code and the New York city health code, and shall make detailed and specific provisions for:\n\n1. Egress. At all times in the course of construction provision shall be made for adequate egress as required by this code and the tenant protection plan shall identify the egress that will be provided. Required egress shall not be obstructed at any time except where approved by the commissioner. \n\n2. Fire safety. All necessary laws and controls, including those with respect to occupied dwellings, as well as additional safety measures necessitated by the construction shall be strictly observed. \n\n3.

Where heat, hot water, cold water, gas, electricity, or other utility services are provided in such building or in any dwelling unit located therein, the tenant protection plan shall specify the means and methods to be used for maintaining such services during such work in accordance with the requirements of the New York city housing maintenance code. If a disruption of any such service is anticipated during the work, then such plan shall specify the anticipated duration of such disruption and the means and methods to be employed to minimize such disruption, including the provision of sufficient alternatives for such service during such disruption. Notification of the disruption must be given to all affected occupants of occupied dwelling units. \n\nException: In the following instances, the tenant protection plan may be prepared and filed by the registered design professional of record for the alteration, construction, or partial demolition work as part of the underlying application:\n\n1. \tWork in occupied one- and two-family homes.\n\n2. \tWork limited to the interior of a single dwelling unit of an occupied multiple dwelling with no disruption to the essential services of other units, where such dwelling is owner-occupied. For a dwelling unit within a property that is owned by a condominium or held by a shareholder of a cooperative corporation under a proprietary lease, the unit must be occupied by the owners of record for such unit.\n\n      � 2.
