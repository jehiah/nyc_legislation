  "Summary": "This bill would require that restaurants in New York City that serve childrenâ€™s meals limit the selection of drinks that contain added sugars or sweeteners. Specifically, combination childrenâ€™s meals may only offer water, sparkling water, flavored water, nonfat or one percent milk, non-dairy milk, 100% fruit or vegetable juice, or fruit or vegetable juice combined with water or carbonated water as the default option. However, a customer could substitute a different drink of their choice by request, rather than selecting one of the default options. The bill would impose monetary penalties on restaurants that violate this law.",
