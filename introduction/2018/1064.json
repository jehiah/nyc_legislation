  "Summary": "This bill would require that restaurants in New York City that serve children’s meals limit the selection of drinks that contain added sugars or sweeteners. Specifically, combination children’s meals may only offer water, sparkling water, flavored water, nonfat or one percent milk, non-dairy milk, 100% fruit or vegetable juice, or fruit or vegetable juice combined with water or carbonated water as the default option. However, a customer could substitute a different drink of their choice by request, rather than selecting one of the default options. The bill would impose monetary penalties on restaurants that violate this law.",
