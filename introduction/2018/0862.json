Such notice may be accompanied by a stop work order pursuant to section 28-207.2 of this code and shall inform the permit holder of the reasons for the proposed revocation and that the applicant has the right to present to the commissioner or his or her representative within 10 business days of delivery of the notice by hand or 15 calendar days of the posting of notice by mail, information as to why the permit should not be revoked.\n\n      � 2.
