  "Summary": "New York City police officers in the K-9 unit are required to live with their police dogs and are expected to accompany them at all times. The Council finds that some landlords and property owners discriminate against New York City police officers who are accompanied by their police work dogs by considering the dogs pets rather than working animals. Accordingly, it is necessary to amend the City's Human Rights Law to protect police officers in the K-9 unit from such housing and public accommodations discrimination. \r\n\r\nThis bill prohibits housing discrimination against persons accompanied by a police dog. This includes discrimination in refusing to sell, rent, lease, approve the sale, rental or lease or otherwise deny to or withhold housing accommodations or an interest therein and in the publication or advertisement of housing accommodations.",
