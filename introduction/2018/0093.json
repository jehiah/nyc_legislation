Failure to notify either department of such damage shall constitute a violation, the penalty for which shall be determined in accordance with section 19-150(b) of the code.\n      � 3. Subdivision a of section 19-152 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law 64 of the year 1995, is amended to read as follows:\n      a. The owner of any real property, at his or her own cost and expense, shall (1) install, construct, repave, reconstruct and repair the sidewalk flags in front of or abutting such property, including but not limited to the intersection quadrant for corner property, and (2) fence any vacant lot or lots, fill any sunken lot or lots and/or cut down any raised lots comprising part or all of such property whenever the commissioner of the department shall so order or direct.

The commissioner shall not direct the owner of one-, two- or three-family residential real property that is (i) in whole or in part, owner occupied, and (ii) used exclusively for residential purposes, to reinstall, reconstruct, repave or repair an abutting sidewalk flag which was damaged by a city-owned tree. The commissioner shall direct the owner to install, reinstall, construct, reconstruct, repave or repair only those sidewalk flags which contain a substantial defect. For the purposes of this subdivision, a substantial defect shall include any of the following:\n       � 4.
