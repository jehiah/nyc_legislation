  "Summary": "The bill would prohibit the sale or distribution of single use water bottles on city property.  The prohibition would apply both to vendors operating on city property, such as parks or city streets, and large scale events where the city grants the event sponsor reliable access to on-site water connections.  Additionally, the bill would prohibit the use of city funds to purchase single use water bottles.",
