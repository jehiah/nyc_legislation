  "Summary": "This bill requires that DCAS develop a residential renewable energy pilot which utilizes a solar thermal district heating system along with solar photovoltaic systems to supply all of the energy for heating, hot water production, cooling and electricity for the development. The homes in the project shall be affordable and remain affordable for the duration of the program.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Subchapter 2 of chapter 1 of title 3 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 3-126 to read as follows: \n      � 3-126 Solar powered pilot program. a.

The designated agency shall develop and conduct a pilot program in which a district-scale solar thermal heating system is used in conjunction with solar photovoltaic systems to provide all of the heating, hot water, cooling and electricity needs for covered buildings participating in such program.\n      c. The designated agency shall consider utilizing underground borehole thermal energy storage to store solar energy generated in connection with such program. If the designated agency determines that the use of such storage means is not practicable or is otherwise undesirable, such agency shall set forth the reasons therefor in the findings required by subdivision e of this section.\n      d. The designated agency shall establish a procedure for selecting a suitable site which is the recipient of sufficient solar radiation for the covered buildings to successfully participate in such program.  \n      e. The purchaser of a residential building that is part of the pilot program must enter into a regulatory agreement with the department of housing preservation and development requiring that the building and each dwelling unit offered for rent in such building be made and remain affordable to the occupant or subsequent purchaser thereof for the duration of such program, in a manner determined by such department. \n      f.
