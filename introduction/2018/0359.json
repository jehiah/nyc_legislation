It would require LPC to refer all applications for certificates of appropriateness to affected community boards after they are filed with the commission. It would require LPC to wait to hold its required public hearing on the application to allow a sufficient amount of time for the affected community board to review and comment on applications. The bill also would require an additional, second community board referral and notification to the local councilmember when an application is significantly modified after LPC holds its public hearing on the application. A modification would be considered significant if it resulted in:\r\n\r\n1. Any change in the footprint of the proposed improvement,\r\n2. Any increase in the height of the proposed improvement, or\r\n3. Any significant change in the exterior design elements or materials\r\n\r\nLastly, the bill would require LPC to notify both the community board and the local councilmember if the Commission made further modifications to the proposal after a second community board referral.","TextID":60837,"Text":"Int.
