  "Summary": "This bill would require the Commissioner of the New York City Department of Transportation (DOT) (the “Commissioner”) to give priority to senior-only housing developments operated by the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA), followed by non-senior only NYCHA developments when determining the order of repairs to be made at sidewalks in front of or abutting properties, when the DOT is required by law or has otherwise undertaken to make these repairs. The bill would further establish that this priority would not apply where the Commissioner determines that a non-NYCHA property is in need of critical or emergency sidewalk repairs. In these cases, the Commissioner would be required to provide the reasons for this determination in writing to the council member and community board for the council and community district, respectively, where the NYCHA property that loses priority status is located.",
