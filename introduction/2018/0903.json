  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Correction to assist people being released in the process of receiving unused commissary funds and ensure that any person with unused commissary funds is immediately given up to $200 in commissary funds in cash upon request. The bill would also require the Department to make reasonable efforts to return unused commissary funds to formerly incarcerated individuals and to establish a plan for raising awareness regarding obtaining commissary funds. It would also require a yearly report on the outstanding commissary funds and the attempts made to return such funds.",
