  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DoITT) to create a public online searchable database through which all agencies that issue notices of violation returnable to the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings (“OATH”) Hearings Division and through which the Department of Housing Preservation and Development must report on violations from issuance of notice to resolution. The bill would also require DoITT to provide quarterly updates to the Speaker on the completion of the database and require agencies to report to DoITT and the Speaker on the information they are unable to make available in the database.",
