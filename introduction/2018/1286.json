  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Education to issue an annual report to the Mayor and City Council regarding District 75 programs. District 75 programs, designated as such by the Department of Education, provide educational, vocational, and behavioral support to students with significant challenges, such as Autism Spectrum Disorders, significant cognitive delays, emotional disturbances, sensory impairments and multiple disabilities. The report would include the number of students in each building that provides a District 75 program as well as the categories of criteria used to determine the location of where a District 75 program will be provided. The report would also be published online. The first report is due August 30, 2019.",
