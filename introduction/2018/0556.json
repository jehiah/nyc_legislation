  "Summary": "Recently enacted amendments to the New York State Runaway and Homeless Youth Act permits shelters for runaway and homeless youth to serve youth ages 21-24, referred to as homeless young adults, if municipalities include the extended age range in the runaway and homeless youth plan submitted to the New York State Office of Children and Family Services. This bill would require the Department of Youth and Community Development (DYCD) to include in the continuum of services it provides transitional independent living support programs and runaway and homeless youth crisis services programs that offer shelter services to homeless young adults.",
