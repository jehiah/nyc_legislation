The bill would also deny permits for 1 year for a building following a determination that work was conducted without a permit while such building was occupied. The bill would not apply to condominiums or cooperatives, and exempts permits sought to correct outstanding DOB or HPD violations, permits necessary to protect public health and safety, properties that are the subject of certain court proceedings, and permits required for certain DOB or HPD programs.",
