  "Summary": "This bill would require that five percent of the City of New York’s capital budget be appropriated for the capital needs of the library systems each fiscal year.",
  "TextID": 55506,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n \n           Section 1.  Legislative findings and intent.  The council finds that the public libraries of the city provide critical educational, cultural, and technological resources to the citizens of the city.  The council further finds that public libraries suffer from inadequate capital funding, despite the growing needs of the library systems such as major infrastructure needs at library branches, combined with increased circulation and program attendance numbers. The council finds that despite being valuable assets to neighborhoods in the city, public libraries are not guaranteed consistent funding to cover basic building needs. The council further finds that an equitable means to remedy this problem is to allocate a portion of the city's capital budget to ensure that the libraries have sufficient funds to meet their expanding capital needs.\n       �2.  Chapter 1 of title 5 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 5-108 to read as follows:\n      �5-108 Items to be included in annual budget. a. Upon agreement between the mayor and the council, a sum representing five percent of the capital budget assessed each fiscal year shall be appropriated for the capital projects of the library systems.\n      �3.  This local law takes effect immediately. \nACK\nLS 1960\n1/10/2018 3:56pm",
