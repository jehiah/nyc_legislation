The bill requires city agencies conducting public presentations in or targeting residents of such areas to translate advertising for the presentation and to provide simultaneous language services at the presentation in the top non-English language. If the second most commonly spoken language is represented by ten or more percent of LEP residents of such area, then the city agency, resources permitting, shall seek to make the public presentation accessible in that language as well.  Finally, resources permitting, the bill members of the public would be able to request simultaneous language services in languages other than those being provided.","TextID":61933,"Text":"Int.
