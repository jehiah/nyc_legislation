Such ridership guide shall include a description of eligibility for school bus services, what the services entail, and the responsibilities of students and parents using DOE’s school bus services. The guide would also include information for parents and students living in temporary housing and students in foster care as it relates to eligibility and use of DOE’s school bus services, and answers to common questions from all parents and guardians relating to school bus services. Finally, the bill would require such materials to be posted on the department’s website in English and in the top six limited English proficiency languages spoken by the population of New York City as determined by the Department of City Planning.",
