These agencies would also be required to inform parents or guardians, when they seek services, that they can obtain, without cost or payment, an inspection of their dwelling unit for peeling paint by calling 311, and a lead testing kit for drinking water from the Department of Environmental Protection.","TextID":66064,"Text":"Int.
