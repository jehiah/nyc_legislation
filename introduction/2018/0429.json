  "TextID": 60782,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n      \n      Section 1. As used in this local law, the term \"outdoor reset control\" means a device that is capable of (i) monitoring the outside temperature with a sensor located on the exterior of a building, (ii) monitoring the internal building temperature using a sensor located at either the location furthest from the heat source in the building, or in the area of the building that is hardest to heat, and (iii) transmitting the temperature data to the heating plant to control the heat level in the building. \n      � 2. By no later than December 31, 2019, the department of buildings shall prepare and file with the mayor and the council, and post on its website, a report analyzing whether outdoor reset controls improve energy efficiency, and, if so, the feasibility of requiring the installation of such controls in all residential buildings.\n\t� 3. This local law takes effect immediately.\n\n\nMPC\nLS #8436/Int. No. 1310-2016\nLS #127\n12/5/17 7:08pm\n      1\n      \n      \n      \n      2",
