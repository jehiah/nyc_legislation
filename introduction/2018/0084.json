  "Summary": "It is currently difficult for members of the public to discern whether a school is in session, especially over the summer, for the purpose of parking regulations that are only in effect on school days. This proposed law would require the Department of Education and the Department of Transportation to post on their websites information on when public schools, including charter schools, are in session.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. The heading of chapter 17 of title 21-A of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 4 for the year 2018, is amended to read as follows:\n      Chapter 17. Distribution of information regarding summer school and meals \n      � 2. Chapter 17 of title 21-A of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 21-979.1 to read as follows:\n      � 21-979.1 Posting summer school calendar information by school. a. Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the term \"school building\" means any buildings, grounds, facilities, property, or portion thereof, owned or leased by the department or over which the department has care, custody and control, in which there is a public school, including a charter school.\n      b. No later than June 30 of each year, the department shall post on its website information regarding the forthcoming summer school session, including but not limited to the locations of school buildings where summer school will be provided and the dates on which summer school will be in session at each such school building. Nothing contained herein shall prevent the department from making any change to such locations and such dates after June 30, provided however that if the department makes any such change the department shall update the information posted on its website regarding such locations and dates as appropriate.\n      c. No later than June 30 of each year, the department of transportation shall post on its website information on the locations of school buildings and summer school dates posted in accordance with subdivision b of this section, and for each such school building where there are parking restrictions on a street immediately adjacent to such school building that are in effect only on school days, that such restrictions are in effect on such summer school dates.   \n      � 3.
