  "Summary": "It is currently difficult for members of the public to discern whether a school is in session, especially over the summer, for the purpose of parking regulations that are only in effect on school days. This proposed law would require the Department of Education and the Department of Transportation to post on their websites information on when public schools, including charter schools, are in session.",
