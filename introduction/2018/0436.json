The database would include such spaces that exist as of the bill’s effective date and locations that are subsequently designated as community facility spaces. The designated agency must update the database within six months following any addition or change to any data. The database must also be posted on the city’s website and published to the city’s open data portal. Content-wise, the database must include the location of each community facility space, a description of the type of space, the name and address of current occupants or the vacancy status, and any other information required by the designated agency. The Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications must certify to the designated agency within one year of the bill’s effective date that the database is substantially complete.","TextID":60849,"Text":"Int.
