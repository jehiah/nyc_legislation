  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n      Section 1. Section 3306.9.12.1 of the building code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 141 for the year 2013, is amended to read as follows:\n3306.9.12.1 Protection of floor openings. Every opening in a floor used for the removal of debris shall be tightly enclosed with a shaftway, extending from floor to floor, with such shaftway enclosed with:\n\n1.  Planking not less than 2 inches (51 mm) in thickness, or equivalent solid material; [or]\n\n2.  Where  the  opening  is  used  for  the  removal  of  noncombustible  material,  wire  mesh  may  be  utilized  in  lieu  of planking, provided such mesh is not less than number 18 gage wire mesh, with openings in the wire no longer than  1/2  inch (13  mm),  and  also provided  that  the  wire  mesh  is securely  attached, in  accordance  with drawings developed by  a  registered design professional, to the shaftway  so that the wire mesh enclosure in  any  location does not deflect more than 2 inches (51 mm) when a force of at least 200 pounds (890 n) is applied along any horizontal portion of such wire mesh enclosure[.]; or\n\n3.  A guardrail system, vertical netting and horizontal netting where required by Sections 3308.6 and 3308.7.\n\nExceptions:\n\n1.  In buildings not more than six stories in height, a shaftway is not required. Instead openings in the floor shall be solidly planked over while not in use by planking not less than 2 inches (51 mm) in thickness, or equivalent solid material, and laid close. Where such working deck reaches a height of six stories or 75 feet above the level of the ground, horizontal netting shall be provided at a level not more than two stories or 30 feet below, as required by section 3308.6.1. \n\n2.  A shaftway is not required at the working deck.

Any floor opening or interior shaftway;\n\n[1.] 2. In concrete structures: the stripping floor; or\n\n[2.] 3. In steel structures: at the uppermost story where the concrete floor slab has been poured.\n\nException: When tarpaulins encase one or more floors immediately below the finished concrete floor in order to maintain temporary heat, the horizontal netting may be located no more than three floors below the finished concrete floor.\n      � 6. Section 3308.6.1.2 of the New York city building code, as amended by local law 141 for the year 2013, is amended to read as follows:\n3308.6.1.2 During demolition. When the demolition of the exterior walls or the roof of a building occurs at a height greater than 6 stories or 75 feet (22 860 mm), horizontal safety netting shall be provided at a level not more than two stories or 30 feet (9144 mm) below the story from which the exterior walls and roof are being removed or below any floor opening or interior shaftway.\n\nException: Demolition of exterior walls only for the purposes of the alteration, maintenance, or repair of a facade shall be in accordance with Section 3308.6.1.3.\n\t� 7.

Horizontal safety nets shall be reinstalled immediately following the end of active loading or unloading operations, or active work, or at the end of the workday, whichever occurs sooner.\n      \n      � 8. Section 3308.7 of the New York city building code, as amended by local law 141 for the year 2013, is amended to read as follows:\n3308.7 Guardrail system.

Guardrail systems may be temporarily removed in the immediate area where active loading or unloading operations, including debris removal, are occurring, or where perimeter work is occurring, provided that:\n\n1.   A controlled access zone is established to prevent unauthorized personnel from entering the area where the guardrail system is removed; and\n\n2.  Immediately prior to the removal of the guardrail system the floor is broom swept and cleared of all materials and equipment to a distance of at least 10 feet (3048 mm), in all directions, from the area where the guardrail system will be removed, except for material and equipment related to the loading or unloading operation or perimeter work or stored in accordance with Section 3303.4.5.2.\n\n\t� 10.
