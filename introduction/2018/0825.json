This bill would require the New York City Fire Department to submit to the Council, and post on its website, a report including the following information for the previous year: how many ambulance tours ceased to be covered by private ambulances, how many ambulance tours began to be covered by private ambulances and the net increase or decrease in such tours.  The report would disaggregate the information by council district.",
