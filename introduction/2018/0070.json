  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Subdivision f of section 10-172 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law 2 for the year 2016, is amended to read as follows:\n      f. Except as set forth in subdivision g of this section, the administering agency shall provide reimbursement of the allowable costs for:\n      1. one security guard at a qualifying nonpublic school that enrolls [from 300] up to 499 students;\n      2. two security guards at a qualifying nonpublic school that enrolls at least 500 students; and\n      3. an additional security guard at a qualifying nonpublic school for each additional 500 students enrolled.\n      For purposes of this subdivision, students with respect to whom the city separately provides assistance that includes funding for security shall not be included in the reimbursement determination, and reimbursement for the services of one security guard during periods of school-related instruction or school-related events may include the costs of different individuals providing security services at different times. Further, the term \"student\" shall be deemed to refer to the full-time equivalent thereof, based upon a six hour and twenty-minute school day for a student.\n      � 2.

To the extent the administering agency anticipates that the amount requested for reimbursement will exceed the funds available, the administering agency shall reimburse for allowable costs on an equitable basis until such funds are exhausted.\n      � 3.
