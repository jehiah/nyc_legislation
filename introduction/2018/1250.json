The bill would allow for the use of electric scooters incapable of exceeding 20 miles per hour. The bill would also reduce fines for operating certain motorized devices that remain prohibited by local law, amend the law to provide that only prohibited motorized devices operated in a manner that endangers safety or property are subject to impoundment and clarify that operators of electric scooters allowed by local law are subject to State and local laws applicable to bicycle operators as well any additional provisions applicable to e-scooter operators.","TextID":68777,"Text":"Int.
