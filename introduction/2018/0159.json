  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation to conduct a pilot project on the use of cool pavement on City streets—pavement and pavement coatings designed to keep area temperatures cooler than traditional asphalt and thus combat the urban heat island effect. The Department must then submit a report to the mayor and Council on the results of the pilot project.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Cool pavement pilot project. a. Definitions. For purposes of this section, the term \"cool pavement\" means porous, permeable, light-colored or other pavement and pavement coatings designed to reduce pavement temperatures and ambient air temperatures.\n      b. The department of transportation shall conduct a one-year pilot project for the use of cool pavement on city streets in one or more locations. As part of such pilot project, the department shall assess the range of options for cool pavement and the technical feasibility, temperature and other environmental impacts and all anticipated costs of such options. The department shall post on its website and submit to the mayor and the council a report on the results of the pilot project no later than 180 days after the pilot concludes.\n      � 2.
