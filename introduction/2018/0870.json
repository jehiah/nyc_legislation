  "Summary": "This bill would require any full-service animal shelter operated by New York City to post photographs of each adoptable animal within 3 days of receiving such animal, provided that the animal is medically and behaviorally well enough. It would also require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to encourage non-full-service animal shelters to promote the placement of adoptable animals.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Section 17-802 of title 17 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new subdivision k to read as follows:\n      k. \"Adoptable animal\" means any companion animal subject to adoption as defined in subdivision a of this section.\n      � 2. Chapter 8 of title 17 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 17-816 to read as follows:\n\t� 17-816 Promotion of adoptable animals.
