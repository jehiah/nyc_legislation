Chapter 5 of title 19 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 19-552 to read as follows:  \n      � 19-552 Risk of loss on trip payments. a. Notwithstanding any inconsistent regulations, provisions of law or provisions of any contract entered into after the effective date of the local law that added this section, if a payment transaction for a completed trip dispatched by a high-volume for-hire service fails, such high-volume for-hire service shall ensure that the driver receives the entire amount owed to such driver for such completed trip.\n      b. Notwithstanding subdivision a of this section, a high-volume for-hire service may refuse to deposit funds to a driver for rendering services upon a reasonable belief that the driver's account is associated with fraudulent activity.\n      c. Any high-volume for-hire service that violates this section is liable for a civil penalty of not less than $250 nor more than $500 for each offense.\n      � 2.
