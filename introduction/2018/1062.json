  "Summary": "This bill would require drivers for high-volume for-hire services to be paid the full amount for a trip regardless of whether the payment transaction fails, unless the driver’s account is associated with fraudulent activity. The bill would impose a civil penalty of not less than $250 and up to $500 for each violation.",

Notwithstanding any inconsistent regulations, provisions of law or provisions of any contract entered into after the effective date of the local law that added this section, if a payment transaction for a completed trip dispatched by a high-volume for-hire service fails, such high-volume for-hire service shall ensure that the driver receives the entire amount owed to such driver for such completed trip.\n      b. Notwithstanding subdivision a of this section, a high-volume for-hire service may refuse to deposit funds to a driver for rendering services upon a reasonable belief that the driver's account is associated with fraudulent activity.\n      c.
