This bill would thus create a mandatory auto-enrollment payroll deduction IRA program for employees of private sector employers which do not offer a retirement plan and employ five or more employees. The default employee contribution rate would be 5%, which employees can adjust up or down, or opt-out of at any time, up to the annual IRA maximum of $6,000 (or $7,000 if age 50 or above).  The plan would be portable so when employees switch jobs they can continue to contribute or roll over their accounts into other retirement savings plans. Employers would not contribute on behalf of employees.","TextID":70115,"Text":"Int.

Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of this chapter, the board shall not implement a retirement savings program as set forth by this chapter if:\n      a. the board certifies to the mayor and speaker in writing that the state establishes a retirement savings program that requires a substantial portion of employers who would otherwise be covered employers to offer to their employees the opportunity to contribute to accounts through payroll deduction or other method of contribution; or\n      b. the corporation counsel certifies to the mayor and speaker in writing that there is a substantial likelihood that such program conflicts with, or is preempted by, state or federal law, including the employee retirement income security act of 1974, or constitutes an employee benefit plan under such act; or\n      c. the director of management and budget and the comptroller each certify to the mayor and speaker in writing that establishment and implementation of such program would create a material risk of a substantial additional monetary liability or obligation for, or an enforceable guarantee by, the city or its agencies, officers or employees, beyond the ordinary costs of administration.\n      � 20-1407 Elements of the retirement savings program.
