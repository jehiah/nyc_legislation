  "Summary": "This bill would require the department of corrections to maintain a library offering general interest books to inmates in New York City jails. The library would be open during normal waking hours and incarcerated individuals would be permitted to access the library and borrow books, except during lockdown times. These books must be maintained in good condition and may be censored only if they may compromise the safety of the facility or provide instructions for escape. The department of corrections would also be required to report on the number of books it receives, the source of those books, and if those books are censored, the reason for censorship.",
