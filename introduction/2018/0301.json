Chapter 5 of title 19 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 19-548 to read as follows:\n\t�19-548 Display of hit-and-run vehicle information.  a. Upon request of the police department, all taxis and HAIL vehicles that have a mechanism to display information within such vehicles shall display alerts provided by such police department containing identifying information of vehicles involved in collisions where such vehicles left the scene of the collision without reporting in violation of section six hundred of the vehicle and traffic law.  \n\tb. A violation of this section shall subject the owner of such vehicle to a civil penalty of not less than nor more than fifty dollars provided that not more than one violation may be issued within a twenty-four hour period.\n\tc. It shall be an affirmative defense to a violation of this section that the mechanism to display such information was not operational at the time that the request by the police department was made, and that the owner of such vehicle abided by the rules applicable to such mechanism's lack of operation as set forth by the commission and this code; provided however, that such mechanism shall display such information as provided for by this section when the operation of such mechanism resumes.\n      �2.
