  "Summary": "This bill would create a school diversity monitor within the city’s Human Rights Commission. This position would monitor racial segregation in the city’s school system, including charter schools under the jurisdiction of the Department of Education (DOE) and would make recommendations to alleviate disparate impact discrimination. The bill would require the monitor to produce annual reports to the mayor, DOE and the Speaker on DOE’s efforts in combating segregation in the schools and implementation efforts by DOE to ensure greater integration of the overall school system.",
