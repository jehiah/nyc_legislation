  "Summary": "Leading pedestrian intervals signals (LPIs) are pedestrian control signals that display a walk indication before a green indication for the parallel direction of traffic, giving pedestrians time to cross before vehicles are allowed to turn. Under the bill, the City would be required to install LPIs in at least four hundred intersections per year that are adjacent to a hospital, library, school, or senior center until all such intersections in the City have LPIs.",
