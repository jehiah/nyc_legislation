  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation (“DOT”) to develop a standard checklist of safety-enhancing street design elements that the department must consider for all major transportation projects. DOT would be required to post such standard checklist on its website, and could amend the standard checklist by rule only to promote vehicular, pedestrian and bicycle safety. For each major transportation project, DOT would be required to complete a checklist stating which street design elements have been applied, and if an element has not been applied, the reason for not applying such element. The bill would require that DOT post each completed checklist on the department’s website prior to the implementation of the applicable project.",
