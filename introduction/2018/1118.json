  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Veterans’ Services (DVS) to submit an annual report to the council and post on its website information about its personnel and the services provided. Specifically, DVS would be required to report, among other metrics, on the services the agency provides in their offices, resource centers, and field service, the number of employees, their functional titles, and a summary of responsibilities under those titles. In addition, this report would include an accounting of the number of veterans who have inquired about DVS’s services, those who have received services from DVS, as well as how veterans and their families learned about the services provided by the agency.",
