  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to report to the Speaker of the Council information on maternal mortality and morbidity. The bill would expand upon Local Law 55 of 2017, by requiring additional annual reporting on maternal mortality and morbidity and a five-year report on maternal mortality that expands upon the factors being reported. The bill would also codify the maternal mortality and morbidity review committee (M3RC) created by DOHMH in December 2017 and require DOHMH to post information on the disciplines represented by members of the M3RC.",
