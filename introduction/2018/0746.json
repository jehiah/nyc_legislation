  "Summary": "This bill would require the Fire Department (FDNY) to annually report to the Council on potential impacts to fire protection and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) that resulted from rezoning that took place the previous year. This legislation would allow the Council to identify how FDNY’s needs are changing from year to year due to rezoning and to potentially address any disconnect between satisfaction of the needs FDNY has expressed in the past and its current needs.",
