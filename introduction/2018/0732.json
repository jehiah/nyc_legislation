  "Summary": "This bill would raise the cap on public funds received by participating candidates, to establish a full public match system. It would also amend the Campaign Finance Act (CFA) to incorporate the relevant portions of Ballot Question #1, as approved by the voters in the 2018 general election, into the CFA and to adjust dates and deadlines within the CFA to reflect the earlier June primary date established by State law in 2019. Finally, the bill makes other adjustments to the CFA to facilitate the implementation of the aforementioned changes.",
