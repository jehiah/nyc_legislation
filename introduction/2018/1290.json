  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications to conduct a feasibility study on the use of blockchain for the storing of identifying records, the storing of information related to Housing Maintenance Code violations and the recording of deeds, in addition to making other general recommendations on the use of blockchains to improve the operations of City agencies.",
  "TextID": 64315,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\tSection 1. Feasibility study on the use of blockchains for the storing of certain violation and identification information. a. For purposes of this local law, the term \"blockchain\" means a distributed ledger that records information in a linked series of digital blocks, each block containing a cryptographic hash of the previous block, such that once data is recorded in any given block it cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks.\n      b. The department of information technology and telecommunications, in consultation with the chief privacy officer and any other relevant agency, shall conduct a feasibility study on the use of blockchains by agencies for: i) the secure storing of identifying records or information in connection with the identity card program established pursuant to section 3-115 of the administrative code; ii) the storing and maintenance of information pertaining to violations of the housing maintenance code; and iii) the recording of deeds by the city register and office of the Richmond county clerk. \n      c. For each of the items enumerated in subdivision b, such feasibility study shall: \n      1. evaluate the utility, for both the public and agencies, of using a blockchain as compared to the current system;\n      2. evaluate the possible privacy and security impacts of a blockchain system, both with and without encryption, as compared to the current system;\n      3. assess the estimated costs of implementing a blockchain system; and\n      4. make recommendations on how a blockchain system could be implemented or describe the possible barriers that make implementation impossible or impracticable.\n      d. Such feasibility study shall also make recommendations, if any, on when the use of a blockchain could be of the most utility for improving the operations of a city agency.\n      e. Within 12 month after this local law takes effect, the department of information technology and telecommunications shall submit to the mayor and the speaker the feasibility study.\n\tï¿½ 2. This local law takes effect immediately.\n\nBJR\nLS 7969, 7551\n10/12/18  12:40PM",
