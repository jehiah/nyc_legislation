  "Summary": "This bill would require the City to prominently place a sign at capital project sites that identifies the name of the project and responsible agencies and indicates any cost and schedule variances. The sign would provide a phone number and website link for more information about project delays and expenses. The sign would be displayed in a large format font readable by the public from a reasonable distance and be updated at least monthly.",
