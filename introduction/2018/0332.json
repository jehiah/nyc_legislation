  "Summary": "This legislation would permit press vehicles to park where parking or standing is otherwise prohibited (except where prohibited to all motor vehicles) and would provide that they are not required to use an authorized payment method for a metered parking space or comply with any sign indicating a time limit for such metered parking. These rules would apply only if at the time of parking the operator or any occupant of the vehicle is actually engaged in the covering of a news event or a matter of public concern. Finally, the proposed legislation would establish that where any city agency has granted by sign any parking or driving privilege to “vehicles with NYP license plates,” such privilege is extended only to press vehicles and on-duty emergency vehicles.",
