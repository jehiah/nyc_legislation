  "Summary": "This bill would make it an unlawful discriminatory practice to not include in job listings the minimum and maximum salary offered for any position located within New York City. The range for the listed maximum and minimum salary would extend from the lowest salary to the highest salary that the employer in good faith believes it would pay for the advertised job, promotion, or transfer. Temporary staffing firms are exempt from this legislation as they already provide this information after interviews in compliance with the NY State Wage Theft Prevention Act.",
