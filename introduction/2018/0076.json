  "Summary": "The proposed legislation would require the New York Police Department (NYPD) to install temporary street lights in any area where a street light has been broken for an extended period. Moreover, the temporary street lights installed by the NYPD would have the same illumination as those installed and maintained by the Department of Transportation, because the current temporary lights used by the NYPD are too intrusive. The proposed legislation is aimed to address the problem of broken street lights not being repaired for long periods of time, causing public safety concerns.",
