Under the bill, a member of the public residing in the affected community of the matter before the BSA could petition to have an application for a zoning variance or special permit referred to CARP prior to the matter being heard by the BSA. CARP would then hold a hearing on the matter and issue a non-binding recommendation to the BSA. CARP would be purely advisory in nature.","TextID":61509,"Text":"Int.
