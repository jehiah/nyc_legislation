  "TextID": 65924,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\tSection 1. Subchapter 3 of chapter 1 of title 19 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 19-188.1 to read as follows:\n\t� 19-188.1 Pedestrian countdown displays. a. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms have the following meanings:\n      Pedestrian countdown display. The term \"pedestrian countdown display\" means any automated digital reading used in a crosswalk that displays, at the beginning of the flashing upraised hand signal, the number of seconds remaining until the termination of such signal.\n\tTraffic-control signal photo violation-monitoring system. The term \"traffic-control signal photo violation-monitoring system\" means a device installed to work in conjunction with a traffic-control signal which, during operation, automatically produces two or more photographs, two or more microphotographs, a videotape or other recorded images of each vehicle at the time it is used or operated in violation of subdivision (d) of section eleven hundred eleven of the vehicle and traffic law.\n\tb. The department shall install a pedestrian countdown display at any location where a traffic-control signal photo violation-monitoring system is installed unless (i) the department determines that such installation would endanger the safety of any street user, (ii) the department determines that such installation would be inconsistent with the department's guidelines regarding the installation of pedestrian countdown displays, or (iii) such installation would otherwise be impracticable.\n\t� 2.
