  "Summary": "This bill would prohibit staff at the 311 citizen service call center from declining to enter complaints or requests for service into their database for the purposes of forwarding to the appropriate agency to respond on account of the caller or texter failing to provide an address or other location that is in the database utilized by 311. In such instances, the 311 citizen service call center would be required to enter the location, whether it is an unrecognized address, intersection, or other location, into the “notes” section of the database entry, which is intended to allow the responding agency to identify the location to which the caller or texter is referring.",
