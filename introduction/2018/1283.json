  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Education to annually submit to the New York City Council, and post to the Department’s website, a report on nutrition education in New York City schools. The Department would be required to specify whether nutrition education is combined with other health related education and whether it is provided by an external nutrition education provider. The report would include information about the number of certified dieticians teaching nutrition in each school. The data in the report would be aggregated by school. Within each grade level in each school, the data would be disaggregated by race, gender, and free or reduced-price lunch status.",
