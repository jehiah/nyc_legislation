  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Veterans’ Services (DVS) to establish at least one Veterans Resource Center in each borough by June 1, 2019. Each center is required to be located in an area easily accessible and in close proximity to public transportation. DVS is also required to provide each borough with a minimum of 20 hours of service per week, including a minimum of 10 hours at each Veterans Resource Center. The Centers would provide veterans with free, current information on the matters described above, as well as housing, public and private social services, and financial assistance and tax exemptions available to veterans. The Centers would also be staffed with a benefits counselor and make available a veterans resource guide. The commissioner of DVS will commence outreach and education efforts to inform veterans about these Centers. Additionally, DVS would be required, beginning January 1, 2020 and every six months thereafter, to submit a report to the Mayor and Council Speaker on the number of veterans utilizing each center, the services offered by each center, those services and/or information most frequently requested by veterans at each center, the number of full and part-time staff working at each center, the amount of funding allocated to each center, and the feedback received by each center with a general description of such feedback.",
