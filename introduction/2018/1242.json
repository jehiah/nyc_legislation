  "Summary": "This bill would expand the Department of Housing Preservation and Development’s (HPD) online property owner registry by requiring inclusion of Department of Building (DOB) violations related to construction as harassment, including violations of work without a permit and work in violation of a stop work order. It would also require HPD to include rent overcharge information from New York State Homes and Community Renewal and incorporate that information into the registry, if available.",
