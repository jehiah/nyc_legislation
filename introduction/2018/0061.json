  "Summary": "Business owners in New York City deserve expedient and transparent procedures when applying for a permit or license. This local law would require that city agencies that issues permits or licenses establish publicly available timelines for approving permits, tools for tracking the real-time status of permit applications, and would also require that the administration establish steps for accountability if timelines are not adequately met.",
  "TextID": 61234,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Chapter 6 of title 23 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 23-602 to read as follows:\n      � 23-602 Timelines for the approval of permits. a.
