  "Summary": "This bill would prohibit any city agency from agreeing to reduce fines for parking violations in exchange for a waiver of the right to contest parking violations. It would also require that any dismissal of a parking violation or reduction of a fine, other than for certain technical reasons, would require a hearing on the merits of each charge and a written determination by an administrative law judge.",
