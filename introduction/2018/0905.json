  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n\tSection 1. Subdivision 22 of section 8-107 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new paragraph (c) to read as follows:\n      (c) Employer lactation room accommodation policy. \n      (i) An employer shall develop and implement a written policy regarding the provision of a lactation room, which shall be distributed to all employees upon hiring. The policy shall include a statement that employees have a right to request a lactation room, and identify a process by which employees may request a lactation room. This process shall:\n      (1) Specify the means by which an employee may submit a request for a lactation room;\n      (2) Require that the employer respond to a request for a lactation room within a reasonable amount of time not to exceed five business days;\n      (3) Provide a procedure to follow when two or more individuals need to use the lactation room at the same time, including contact information for any follow up required;\n      (4) State that the employer shall provide reasonable break time for an employee to express breast milk pursuant to section 206-c of the labor law; and\n      (5) State that if the request for a lactation room poses an undue hardship on the employer, the employer shall engage in a cooperative dialogue, as required by subdivision 28 of this section. \n      (ii) The commission shall, in collaboration with the department of health and mental hygiene, develop a model lactation room accommodation policy that conforms to the requirements of this subdivision and a model lactation room request form. The commission shall make such model policy and request form available on its website. \n      (iii) The existence of a lactation room accommodation policy pursuant to this subdivision shall not affect an individual's right to breastfeed in public pursuant to article 7 of the civil rights law.\n      ï¿½ 2.
