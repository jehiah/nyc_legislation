  "Summary": "This bill would require employers in the City to establish, and distribute to all new employees, policies describing lactation room accommodations, including the process by which an employee can request such accommodation. The bill would also require the New York City Commission on Human Rights to establish and make available a model lactation room accommodation policy.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n\tSection 1. Subdivision 22 of section 8-107 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new paragraph (c) to read as follows:\n      (c) Employer lactation room accommodation policy. \n      (i) An employer shall develop and implement a written policy regarding the provision of a lactation room, which shall be distributed to all employees upon hiring. The policy shall include a statement that employees have a right to request a lactation room, and identify a process by which employees may request a lactation room. This process shall:\n      (1) Specify the means by which an employee may submit a request for a lactation room;\n      (2) Require that the employer respond to a request for a lactation room within a reasonable amount of time not to exceed five business days;\n      (3) Provide a procedure to follow when two or more individuals need to use the lactation room at the same time, including contact information for any follow up required;\n      (4) State that the employer shall provide reasonable break time for an employee to express breast milk pursuant to section 206-c of the labor law; and\n      (5) State that if the request for a lactation room poses an undue hardship on the employer, the employer shall engage in a cooperative dialogue, as required by subdivision 28 of this section. \n      (ii) The commission shall, in collaboration with the department of health and mental hygiene, develop a model lactation room accommodation policy that conforms to the requirements of this subdivision and a model lactation room request form.
