  "Summary": "The proposed bill would require department of health and mental hygiene supervisors to visit food service establishments and personally observe violations identified by a food service establishment inspector prior to determining whether to close such food service establishments. This legislation would apply to closing determinations arising from a food service establishment’s inability to correct a public health hazard before the end of a sanitary inspection, a food service establishment operating without a valid permit, or a food service establishment receiving 28 or more points on three consecutive sanitary inspections.",
