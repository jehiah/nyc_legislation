  "Summary": "This bill would direct an agency or office designated by the mayor to establish a pilot program for the placement of pet harbors on sidewalks adjacent to commercial establishments. Pet harbors allow pet owners to leave small pets unattended in a safe and enclosed shelter for a short period of time while they enter a commercial establishment. The bill would direct such agency or office designated by the mayor to determine by rule a geographically contiguous area within the borough of Brooklyn that shall constitute the pilot program’s boundaries, and to establish guidelines for the design and use of pet harbors in the pilot program.",
