  "Summary": "This bill would direct an agency or office designated by the mayor to establish a pilot program for the placement of pet harbors on sidewalks adjacent to commercial establishments. Pet harbors allow pet owners to leave small pets unattended in a safe and enclosed shelter for a short period of time while they enter a commercial establishment. The bill would direct such agency or office designated by the mayor to determine by rule a geographically contiguous area within the borough of Brooklyn that shall constitute the pilot programâ€™s boundaries, and to establish guidelines for the design and use of pet harbors in the pilot program.",
