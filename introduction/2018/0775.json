Any rules promulgated by the board to require that disclosure reports submitted pursuant to this chapter be submitted in an electronic format shall provide exemptions for small campaigns, [as defined by board rules,] and for other campaigns that demonstrate that submission in an electronic format would pose a substantial hardship.\n      � 3.
