  "Summary": "Under section 22-205 of the Administrative Code and rules promulgated by the Mayor’s Office of Film, Theatre and Broadcasting (“MOFTB”), MOFTB currently charges a $300 application fee for new projects seeking MOFTB permits and assistance to film or photograph on city property. This bill would require MOFTB to charge an application fee high enough to cover the amount of money it costs the City to review and process the application. The bill would allow MOFTB to create a sliding scale for application fees based on the applicant’s ability to pay.",
