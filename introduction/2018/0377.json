Such agency would also be required to post the annual report on the agency’s website. In addition, the agency would be required to post on its website, at least two weeks prior to a public hearing on the sale of any public street or sidewalk held by the City Planning Commission pursuant to the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure, the proposed date of sale and the proposed sale amount. The bill would increase the transparency of city property disposition, allowing community groups and city residents to become aware of potential upcoming development in their areas.","TextID":61309,"Text":"Int.
