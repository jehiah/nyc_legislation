Floor-ceiling constructions in group R buildings located within 1 mile of a commercial nighttime establishment shall have a minimum impact noise rating (INR) of zero, which shall be obtained by tests conducted by the contractor or building owner in accordance with the procedure of reference standard RS 12-3 and such constructions shall be designed and installed to avoid short circuiting the isolation devices that are incorporated into such constructions.\n\nException: The INR of floor-ceiling constructions listed in reference standard RS 12-3 shall be used to determine compliance with the requirements of this section and with any other provision of this code that requires a specific INR. \n\n1207.3.2.1 Exterior-facing walls, windows, and doors. Exterior-facing walls, partitions, and windows of new commercial nighttime establishments shall have a minimum sound transmission class (STC) rating of 50 for airborne noise.\n\n1207.3.2.2 Commercial nighttime establishment entrances and exit doors.

Door frames for such doors shall be fitted with soundproofing rubber; acoustical caulk; and weatherstripping or door gaskets. Such doors shall be equipped with automatic door bottoms. Commercial nighttime establishment entrance and exit doors shall have a minimum STC of 35.\n\n\t� 3. Section BC 1207 of the New York city building code is amended by adding new sections 1207.5 and 1207.6 to read as follows:\n1207.5 Exterior-facing walls, windows, and doors.
