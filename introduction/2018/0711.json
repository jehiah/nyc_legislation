In addition, the bill would reduce the aggregate maximum sound level for operating a refuse collection vehicle within 50 feet of any residential receiving property between the hours of 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. to 75 dBA, measured at a distance of at least 35 feet from the vehicle.",

Section 24-225 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 113 for the year 2005, is amended to read as follows:\n      � 24-225 Refuse collection vehicles. (a) No person shall sell, offer for sale, operate or permit to be operated a refuse collection vehicle, equipped with a compacter, that produces a maximum sound level when the compacting mechanism is in the compacting cycle but not engaged in compacting a load that exceeds [80] 75 dB(A), when measured by a sound level meter set for slow response at a distance of 35 feet or  more from the compacting unit.\n      (b)  It shall be unlawful to operate or cause to be operated a refuse collection vehicle, including such a vehicle equipped with a compacter, within 50 feet of any residential receiving property at or after 11:00 p.m. and before 7:00 a.m. if the aggregate sound, not including impulsive sound, generated by the collection and compacting activities exceeds [85] 75 dB(A) when measured by a sound level meter set to slow response at a distance of 35 feet or more from the vehicle. [On and after July 1, 2012 such aggregate sound shall not exceed 80 dB(A).] The provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to the operation of refuse collection vehicles during an emergency such as a storm or other event that causes delays in refuse collection.\n      \t� 2.
