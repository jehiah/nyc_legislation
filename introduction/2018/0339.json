  "Summary": "This bill would extend the employment protections of Title 8 of the New York City Administrative Code to domestic workers. Currently, employees of employers with fewer than four employees total are not protected by the prohibitions against discrimination in employment, apprentice training programs, religious observance in the employment context, unemployment status, disparate impact discrimination in the employment context, and unlawful discrimination against victims of domestic violence, sex offenses or stalking. Also, employees of employers with fewer than four employees total are not protected by the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. This bill would expand occupations covered by these protections to include domestic workers.",
