  "Summary": "The proposed bill would ban the practice of on-call scheduling for utility safety employees who locate and mark underground infrastructure. The bill would prohibit employers from canceling, changing or adding work shifts within 72 hours of the start of the shift, except in limited circumstances. The bill would also require the employer to provide a utility safety employee with a written work schedule no later than 72 hours before the first shift on the work schedule, to post the schedule at the work location 72 hours before the beginning of the scheduled hours of work, and to provide the employee, at the employee’s request, a written copy of the work schedule for any week worked within the prior three years.",
