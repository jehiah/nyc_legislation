The determination of cost effectiveness shall not include any savings in energy costs directly attributed to federal, state and other non-city governmental assistance, but shall include the social cost of carbon value, as provided in paragraph 3 of subdivision d of section 3-125 or pursuant to paragraph 4 of subdivision d of section 3-125, provided however, that a site- or project-specific social cost of carbon value may be developed and used in lieu of the social cost of carbon value provided in or pursuant to such paragraphs if such site- or project-specific social cost of carbon value is higher than the social cost of carbon value provided in or pursuant to such paragraphs. \n\tDepartment. The term \"department\" means the department of citywide administrative services.\n      b.

The types of utility-scale energy storage systems that were studied, as applied to various city buildings;\n      2. The city buildings where the installation of a utility-scale energy storage system may be appropriate, as determined by the department and the projected annual energy and other cost savings for each such system, both individually and in the aggregate;\n      3. The number of city buildings where the installation of a utility-scale energy storage system has been commenced by the department or other agency authorized by the commissioner; and\n      4. The number of city buildings where the installation of a utility-scale energy storage system has been completed by the department or  other agency authorized by the commissioner, the type of such system installed on such building, and the annual energy and other cost savings associated with the installation and use of such systems.\n      � 2. No later than 2 years after the effective date of this local law, one or more offices or agencies designated by the mayor shall submit to the mayor and speaker of the council, and make available to the public, a report regarding the feasibility of installing utility-scale energy storage systems on buildings throughout the city other than city buildings, as defined in section 4-207.3 of the administrative code of the city of New York.
