  "Summary": "This bill would require an agency or office designated by the Mayor, working with other agencies and offices, to assess the feasibility of off-hour deliveries to City facilities and implement off-hour deliveries at facilities where it is deemed feasible. Off-hour deliveries—those occurring during overnight hours—reduce congestion by shifting road use to off-peak times. This bill would require the City to study the issue of off-hour deliveries to City facilities and develop a framework for the implementation of such deliveries at City facilities in the central business district (Manhattan south of 60th Street) and at least two highly congested areas outside of the central business district. The City would then have to implement off-hour deliveries where feasible, starting with Manhattan south of Canal Street and then expanding to the rest of the central business district and other highly congested areas. The bill also includes reporting requirements at several stages.",

No later than 180 days after the effective date of this local law, an agency or office designated by the mayor shall, in consultation with other agencies or offices as deemed appropriate by the mayor, develop a framework for the feasibility of city facilities in the central business district and highly congested areas receiving off-hour deliveries and shall submit a report on such framework to the mayor and the speaker of the council. Such report shall include, but need not be limited to, the following:\n      1. A discussion of the problems that currently exist with respect to daytime deliveries at city facilities;\n\t2. A discussion of the existing models of off-hour delivery programs in both the public and private sectors;\n\t3. Recommendations for actions that the city could take to expand off-hour deliveries to city facilities;\n\t4. An assessment of the feasibility of deploying personnel to receive off-hour deliveries at city facilities;\n\t5. Recommendations for actions that the city could take to enable off-hour deliveries without the presence of personnel;\n\t6. Recommendations for actions that the city could take to reduce adverse impacts on communities adjacent to city facilities receiving off-hour deliveries, including through the use of low-noise equipment and operating procedures; and\n\t7. Recommendations for processes through which building and facility delivery and service plans could best be created, implemented and refined over time for city facilities, including through delivery scheduling, vendor consolidation and safer and more environmentally sustainable freight vehicles.\n      c. No later than 270 days after the effective date of this local law, the agency or office designated by the mayor pursuant to subdivision b of this section shall assess all city facilities in lower Manhattan to determine whether off-hour deliveries are feasible at such facilities and such agency or office, in consultation with other agencies or offices as deemed appropriate by the mayor, shall conduct off-hour deliveries at such facilities.\n      d. No later than 18 months after the effective date of this local law, the agency or office designated by the mayor pursuant to subdivision b of this section shall submit a report to the mayor and the speaker of the council regarding off-hour deliveries at each city facility at which off-hour deliveries were implemented pursuant to subdivision c of this section. For each such facility, such report shall include the number of deliveries, the provider of the goods delivered and the value of the goods delivered that have been diverted to off-hours deliveries and any measures taken to increase off-hour deliveries.\n      e.
