  "Summary": "This bill would require an agency or office designated by the Mayor, working with other agencies and offices, to assess the feasibility of off-hour deliveries to City facilities and implement off-hour deliveries at facilities where it is deemed feasible. Off-hour deliveries—those occurring during overnight hours—reduce congestion by shifting road use to off-peak times. This bill would require the City to study the issue of off-hour deliveries to City facilities and develop a framework for the implementation of such deliveries at City facilities in the central business district (Manhattan south of 60th Street) and at least two highly congested areas outside of the central business district. The City would then have to implement off-hour deliveries where feasible, starting with Manhattan south of Canal Street and then expanding to the rest of the central business district and other highly congested areas. The bill also includes reporting requirements at several stages.",
