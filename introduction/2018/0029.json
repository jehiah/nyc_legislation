  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation to study whether traffic signal preemption systems that allow emergency response vehicles the right of way are feasible and beneficial and to implement such systems if so.",
  "TextID": 61522,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      Section 1. The department of transportation shall conduct a study of the feasibility of allowing fire department and police department vehicles to utilize traffic signal preemption systems to transfer the normal operation of a traffic control signal to a special control mode of operation during an emergency, providing the right of way at and through a traffic control signal to such vehicles. Such study shall examine the feasibility of utilizing such systems citywide and in areas in which emergency response times are above the city's average emergency response time, as well as whether such systems would reduce emergency response times. If the department finds that such systems are feasible; would not negatively impact the safety of pedestrians, bicyclists, and other vehicular traffic; and would reduce emergency response times, the department shall take all appropriate measures to implement such systems. No later than July 1, 2018, the department shall post online and submit to the speaker of the council the results of such study, measures taken to institute such systems, and if no measures are taken, the reasons why.\n      ï¿½ 2. This local law takes effect immediately.\n\nKET 12/18/17 6:35PM\nLS 7753/Int 1203-2016\nLS 457",
