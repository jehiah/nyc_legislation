  "Summary": "This bill would ban moving-billboards. These billboards are already illegal under the Rules of the city of New York; so the bill would codify 34 RCNY 4-12(j) and would help to address issues that billboards cause relating to: (1) street congestion, (2) street parking, (3) the City’s aesthetics, (4) pedestrian and driver visibility, (5) safety risks, and (6) exhaust fumes.",
