  "Summary": "This local law would require the Department of Finance (DOF) to make best efforts to collect the name, telephone number, and email address of all owners of real property and, once such information is received, or equivalent information of an individual authorized to receive communications regarding the property on behalf of the owner. The legislation would require that DOF, at a minimum, solicit the contact information on hard copy and online forms, applications, and other documents created by the department for submission by a property owner related to the recording of deed- or mortgage-related documents, or the administration of real property personal tax exemption programs, the tax lien sale, the real property transfer tax, or the tax on mortgages. Once received DOF must ensure that such contact information is maintained in a computer database used by the Department for purposes of administering the real property tax.",
