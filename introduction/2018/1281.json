  "Summary": "This bill prohibits food and retail establishments from refusing to accept cash from consumers. It also prohibits establishments from charging cash-paying consumers a higher price than cash-less consumers. The bill provides for penalties of not more than $1000 for a first violation, and of not more than $1500 for each succeeding violation. There are some modifications and exceptions in the bill. Food and retail establishments do not have to accept bills in denominations of greater than $20. Transactions taking place completely online, by phone or mail are excluded. Food and retail establishments that have devices that convert cash into prepaid cards on their premises are considered to accept cash only if several requirements are met. Such devices cannot charge a fee or require a minimum deposit over one dollar. There can be no limit on the number of transactions on such cards. The funds on the card cannot expire. Where a device malfunctions, an establishment must accept cash, and shall have a sign stating such on or immediately adjacent to the cash-conversion device.",
