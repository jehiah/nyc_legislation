  "Summary": "This bill would require the director of the Mayor‚Äôs Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability, in consultation with an agency designated by the mayor, to conduct a study for the installation of geothermal energy systems on government owned sites.  Specifically, the bill would require that a study first be conducted by the director to determine what potential sites could be retrofitted with such systems and then select up to 10 government owned buildings that could have geothermal systems installed in order to demonstrate the suitability of such systems. The bill would also require detailed reporting every 2 years on various aspects of the pilot program, including recommendations on whether the program should be expanded.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n       \n      Section 1. Legislative findings and intent. The Council finds that the use of geothermal exchange systems in New York City would result in reduced air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, lessen energy demand, and improve the health and well-being of New York City residents. A geothermal exchange system, as described in this local law, exchanges heat between the earth and two or more buildings for the purpose of providing heating, cooling and hot water. In 2019, the New York State Legislature enacted the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA) Chapter 106 of the laws of 2019, finding that climate change was a matter of significant concern across the State, and setting benchmarks towards a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions across New York State from all anthropogenic sources 100% over 1990 levels by the year 2050. In New York City, Local Law 97 for the year 2019 provides that there shall be, at minimum, a 40 percent reduction in citywide emissions by 2030, and an 80 percent reduction in citywide emissions by 2050. \n      The Council finds that the use of geothermal exchange systems in New York City would further the goals of the CLCPA and Local Law 97. The use of geothermal exchange systems would help combat global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. To the extent that reliance on energy from greenhouse gases is lessened, the use of geothermal exchange systems can contribute to fewer air emissions and air quality related respiratory diseases. Geothermal exchange systems will similarly help mitigate against the effects of climate change that have already begun to affect the City, as evidenced by the increased frequency of life- and property-threatening weather events. Therefore, the Council finds that it is in the best interests of the health and well-being of New York City residents to authorize the creation of a demonstration program for geothermal exchange systems.\n      ÔøΩ 2. Subchapter 2 of chapter 1 of title 3 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 3-125.1 to read as follows:\n      ÔøΩ 3-125.1 Geothermal exchange system demonstration program. a. Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings:\n      Administering agency. The term \"administering agency\" means the office or agency designated by the mayor, pursuant to subdivision c of this section, to implement and administer the provisions of this section.\n      Building. The term \"building\" has the same meaning as provided in section 28-101.5.\n      Director. The term \"director\" means the director of the mayor's office of long-term planning and sustainability.\n      Environmental justice. The term \"environmental justice\" has the same meaning as provided in section 3-1001.\n      Geothermal exchange service. The term \"geothermal exchange service\" means the provision of thermal energy from, or rejection of thermal energy to, a geothermal exchange system.\n      Geothermal exchange system. The term \"geothermal exchange system\" means a system owned by the city that is used to exchange heat between the earth and two or more buildings for the purpose of providing heating, cooling or hot water to two or more buildings. The term \"geothermal exchange system\" may also include a waste heat system.\n      Government building.

Legislative findings and intent. The Council finds that the use of geothermal exchange systems in New York City would result in reduced air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, lessen energy demand, and improve the health and well-being of New York City residents. A geothermal exchange system, as described in this local law, exchanges heat between the earth and two or more buildings for the purpose of providing heating, cooling and hot water. In 2019, the New York State Legislature enacted the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA) Chapter 106 of the laws of 2019, finding that climate change was a matter of significant concern across the State, and setting benchmarks towards a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions across New York State from all anthropogenic sources 100% over 1990 levels by the year 2050. In New York City, Local Law 97 for the year 2019 provides that there shall be, at minimum, a 40 percent reduction in citywide emissions by 2030, and an 80 percent reduction in citywide emissions by 2050. \\par\nThe Council finds that the use of geothermal exchange systems in New York City would further the goals of the CLCPA and Local Law 97. The use of geothermal exchange systems would help combat global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. To the extent that reliance on energy from greenhouse gases is lessened, the use of geothermal exchange systems can contribute to fewer air emissions and air quality related respiratory diseases. Geothermal exchange systems will similarly help mitigate against the effects of climate change that have already begun to affect the City, as evidenced by the increased frequency of life- and property-threatening weather events. Therefore, the Council finds that it is in the best interests of the health and well-being of New York City residents to authorize the creation of a demonstration program for geothermal exchange systems.\\par\n\\cf1\\'a7 2.\\cf0  \\cf1 Subchapter 2 of chapter 1 of title 3 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 3-125.1 to read as follows:\\f1\\fs27\\par\n\\ul\\f0\\fs24\\'a7 3-125.1 Geothermal exchange system demonstration program. a.
