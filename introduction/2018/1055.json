  "Summary": "This proposed local law amends Chapter 24-424 of the Administrative Code by adding a new subdivision d. requiring an office or agency designated by the mayor to examine, survey and map all methane leaks and to provide written notification to any relevant gas utility of the city’s intent or the city’s grant of consent to open the ground on any public way to survey the area for the presence of natural gas.  Where natural gas leaks are identified this proposed local law would require repair or replacement of any aging, leak-prone or leaking natural gas infrastructure located on or in any public way responsible for a large volumetric leak.  Where any leaking natural gas infrastructure that is the source of a large volumetric leak is not repaired within ninety days after notice, the designated agency shall repair the leak and seek cost recovery on behalf of the city.",
