  "Summary": "This bill would require that the 2014 New York City Construction Codes, amendments to the Codes since 2014, the Integrated 2014 Construction Codes Administrative Provisions, and the 2017 Code Revision Cycle Handbook be posted on the City’s website. Although all of these documents are available on the NYC Department of Buildings (DOB) website, it is currently impossible for users to download these documents in bulk. The entire 2014 New York City Construction Codes in PDF and hard copy are available for purchase from the CityStore, but their cost may be prohibitive for some members of the public. A PDF containing links to the Codes’ amendments is available DOB’s website, but it requires users to open and download each local law individually. Providing a compilation of these documents on a City website will increase public access.",
