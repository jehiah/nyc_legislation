The study must consider areas where properties have similar geology and the individual well drilling might because prohibited; where groups of property owners with a history of working collaboratively such as block associations and civic groups and where the economies of scale can be achieved. Where areas most suitable for the installation of geothermal mini grid or district heating and cooling applications have been identified, the bill requires creation of a plan for facilitating an operating district scale geothermal systems.","TextID":63647,"Text":"Int.
