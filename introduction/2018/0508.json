  "Summary": "Employers are increasingly requiring their employees to sign non-compete agreements as a condition of employment, even in low-wage jobs where such provisions do not serve an obvious purpose. These covenants can lead to low-wage employees being unreasonably restricted in finding new jobs. This bill would prohibit employers from requiring low-wage employees to enter into covenants not to compete as a condition of their employment.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      Section 1. Chapter 5 of title 22 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 22-510 to read as follows:\n\t� 22-510 Prohibition of covenants not to compete for low-wage employees. \n      a.

The term \"employee\" means an employee as defined in subdivision 2 of section 190 of the labor law.\n      Employer. The term \"employer\" means an employer as defined in subdivision 3 of section 190 of the labor law. \n      Low-wage employee. The term \"low-wage employee\" means a clerical and other worker as defined in subdivision 7 of section 190 of the labor law.\n      b. Prohibition. No employer shall enter into a covenant not to compete with any low-wage employee of such employer. \n      c. Disclosure requirement for non-low-wage workers. An employer may not require a potential employee who is not a low-wage employee to enter into a covenant not to compete unless, at the beginning of the process for hiring such employee, such employer disclosed in writing that they may be subject to such a covenant.\n      d. Enforcement. The office of labor standards shall enforce the requirements of this section. \n      � 2. This local law takes effect 120 days after it becomes law; provided, however, that the office of labor standards shall take all actions necessary for its implementation, including the promulgation of rules, before such date.\n\n\nJR (2016)/MMB (2017)\nLS #6288/Int 1663-2017\nNEW LS # 157\n12/1/17 12:08 p.m.",
