  "Summary": "This bill would require owners of residential buildings to provide copies of any notice of violation issued against a property to the residents of that property. For a violation in a common area or that affects all residents, the owner would be required to post a copy of the notice of violation conspicuously in the lobby. For a violation in an occupied unit, the owner would be required to distribute a copy of the notice of violation to residents of each adjacent unit. As well, the Department of Buildings must create a pamphlet or flyer explaining the adjudication process for such violations, to be distributed with the copies of notices of violations.",
