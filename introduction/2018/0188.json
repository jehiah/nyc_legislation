The administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 23-304 to read as follows:\n      � 23-304 Repeated anonymous unfounded complaints. a. The 311 customer service center, upon receipt of any non-emergency anonymous complaint relating solely to a property classified as harassed, shall document such call but shall not refer such call to any agency.\n      b. For the purposes of this section:\n      1. a property shall be classified as \"harassed\": (i) if it is a privately-owned property that, within a six month period, is the sole subject of three or more anonymous complaints made to the 311 customer service center and referred to an agency; and (ii) such agency is unable to substantiate the condition or circumstance complained of, despite reasonable efforts; or (iii) such agency substantiates such condition or circumstance, but the condition or circumstance is not a violation of any applicable law. Such classification shall last for three months from the date of the third such complaint; and\n      2. \"anonymous complaint\" means a complaint made to the 311 customer service center where the complaining individual does not give his or her name and address, whether or not such information is requested.\n      � 2.
