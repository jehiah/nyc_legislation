Additionally, the bill would require the New York City Department of Environmental Protection to create a position responsible for: (1) reviewing noise mitigation plans with schools near construction sites to ensure that such schools are aware of the protections in place to mitigate the impact of noise; and (2) establishing a system to receive and respond to comments, questions and complaints with respect to the impact of construction noise on schools.","TextID":60833,"Text":"Int.
