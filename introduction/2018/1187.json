The commissioner shall remove, or cause to be removed any vehicle, box, barrel, bale of merchandise or other movable property or article or thing whatsoever found upon any street, in accordance with regulations adopted by the [board of estimate] department of sanitation.

Subchapter 2 of chapter 1 of title 19 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 19-169.3 to read as follows:\n      � 19-169.3 Removal of improperly parked motor vehicles. a. Except as may otherwise be provided by law, rule or regulation, any vehicle that is parked in violation of paragraph (a) of subdivision 1 of section 402 of the vehicle and traffic law or subdivision (j) of section 4-08 of title 34 of the rules of the city of New York shall be removed by a tow truck of the towing company participating in the rotation tow program within 24 hours when directed to do so by the police department if not already removed by the department of sanitation. The police department shall direct the towing company to remove the vehicle as soon as practicable upon notification from the department of sanitation or from the city or, in the case of vehicles parked in violation of  paragraph (3) of subdivision (j) of section 4-08 of title 34 of the rules of the city of New York only, discovery or notification from the general public, the department of sanitation or from the city. \n      b. A person who removes a vehicle pursuant to section 19-169.3 may collect charges from the owner or other person in control of such vehicle, payable before the vehicle is released, in accordance with the provisions of subdivision c of section 20-519. No charge may be collected for removal or storage of a vehicle pursuant to this section by a person who is not licensed to engage in towing pursuant to subchapter 31 of chapter 2 of title 20 of the code.\n      � 3. Subdivision a of section 20-519 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 110 for the year 1993, is amended to read as follows:\n      a. 1. The commissioner shall establish a program to be known as the \"rotation tow program\" for the purpose of removing evidence vehicles, vehicles suspected of having been stolen or abandoned other than vehicles described in subdivision two of section twelve hundred twenty-four of the vehicle and traffic law, the removal pursuant to section 19-169 of the code of vehicles blocking a private driveway, [and] the removal pursuant to section 24-221 of the code of vehicles with certain alarm devices, and the removal pursuant to section 19-169.3. \n      2. The commissioner, after consultation with the police commissioner, shall divide the city into zones and shall create for each zone a list in random order of persons licensed to engage in towing who have been approved by the commissioner for participation in the rotation tow program. The commissioner may in his or her discretion create from such list separate lists for the removal of evidence vehicles, stolen and abandoned vehicles, the removal pursuant to section 19-169 of the code of vehicles blocking a private driveway, [and] the removal pursuant to section 24-221 of the code of vehicles with certain alarm devices[, respectively] and the removal pursuant to section 19-169.3. At any time subsequent to the initial establishment of zones and lists, the commissioner may, after consultation with the police commissioner, modify the zones and reformulate the lists to ensure sufficient towing services throughout the city. Where more than one towing company has been placed on a list of towing companies authorized to remove vehicles in a particular zone, the police department shall summon towing companies from such list on a rotating basis. Any towing company approved for participation in such program after such lists are initially established shall be placed on any such list at the point immediately preceding the last towing company summoned by the police department pursuant to this section. Such lists shall be available at the department for public inspection.\n      � 4. Subdivision b of section 20-519 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 110 for the year 1993, is amended to read as follows:\n      b. 1. Any vehicle that is suspected of having been stolen or abandoned other than vehicles described in subdivision two of section twelve hundred twenty-four of the vehicle and traffic law, any vehicle that is blocking a private driveway and subject to removal pursuant to section 19-169 of the code, [and] any vehicle with certain alarm devices which is subject to removal pursuant to section 24-221 of the code and any vehicle subject to removal pursuant to section 19-169.3 shall be removed by a tow truck of the towing company participating in the rotation tow program when directed to do so by the police department. If such vehicle appears to have a missing or altered vehicle identification number, the police may direct its removal to the police property clerk. All other vehicles shall be towed to the storage facility of such responding company which meets such specifications as the commissioner shall establish by rule, and shall at all times be stored within such storage facility while the vehicle is in the custody of the towing company. Such storage facility shall be the premises listed on the license of the towing company responding to the police department's direction to remove a vehicle or the premises approved by the commissioner for use by such towing company. Such premises shall be owned, operated or controlled by such towing company and shall not be used by any other towing company. The police department shall expeditiously make every reasonable effort to notify the owner and the national automobile theft bureau or the insurer, if any, of any vehicle that is suspected of having been stolen or abandoned of the vehicle's location and the procedure for retrieval. During the period commencing on the eighth day after the vehicle is removed to such storage facility and ending on the thirtieth day after such removal, such towing company shall transfer any vehicle which has not been claimed into the custody of the police department property clerk. \n      2. An evidence vehicle shall be removed by a towing company participating in the rotation tow program when directed to do so by the police department. Such vehicle shall be towed to a location designated by a police officer. \n      3. No tow truck operator shall knowingly remove a vehicle suspected of having been stolen or abandoned or an evidence vehicle without authorization by the police department. No tow truck operator shall knowingly remove a vehicle blocking a private driveway subject to removal pursuant to section 19-169 of the code except as authorized in such section.
