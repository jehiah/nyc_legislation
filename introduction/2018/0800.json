  "Summary": "This bill would update the Earned Safe and Sick Time Law by adding personal time. Employers with five or more employees or employers of one or more domestic worker would be required to provide all employees with personal time for absences from work for any reason. Like paid safe/sick time, employers would provide employees with one hour of personal time for every 30 hours worked by an employee, with a maximum of 80 hours of personal time in any calendar year.",

Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as requiring financial or other reimbursement to an employee from an employer upon the employee's termination, resignation, retirement, or other separation from employment for accrued [sick] safe/sick time or personal time that has not been used.\n      j. If an employee is transferred to a separate division, entity or location in the city of New York, but remains employed by the same employer, such employee is entitled to all safe/sick time and personal time accrued at the prior division, entity or location and is entitled to retain or use all safe/sick time and personal time as provided pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. When there is a separation from employment and the employee is rehired within six months of separation by the same employer, previously accrued safe/sick time and personal time that was not used shall be reinstated and such employee shall be entitled to use such accrued [safe/sick] time at any time after such employee is rehired, provided that no employer shall be required to reinstate such [safe/sick] time to the extent the employee was paid for unused accrued [safe/sick] time prior to separation and the employee agreed to accept such pay for such unused [safe/sick] time. \n      � 20-914.

Upon mutual consent of the employee and the employer, an employee who is absent for a reason listed in subdivision a of section 20-914 of this chapter may work additional hours during the immediately preceding seven days if the absence was foreseeable or within the immediately subsequent seven days from that absence without using safe/sick time or personal time to make up for the original hours for which such employee was absent, provided that an adjunct professor who is an employee at an institute of higher education may work such additional hours at any time during the academic term. An employer shall not require such employee to work additional hours to make up for the original hours for which such employee was absent or to search for or find a replacement employee to cover the hours during which the employee is absent pursuant to this section. If such employee works additional hours, and such hours are fewer than the number of hours such employee was originally scheduled to work, then such employee shall be able to use safe/sick time or personal time provided pursuant to this chapter for the difference. Should the employee work additional hours, the employer shall comply with any applicable federal, state or local labor laws. \n      � 20-916. Collective bargaining agreements. a.

No [employer] person shall [engage in retaliation or threaten retaliation against an employee for exercising or attempting to exercise any right provided pursuant to this chapter, or] interfere with any investigation, proceeding or hearing pursuant to this chapter.

Taking an adverse action includes, but is not limited to threatening, intimidating, disciplining, discharging, demoting, suspending, or harassing an employee, reducing the hours of pay of an employee, informing another employer that an employee has engaged in activities protected by this chapter and implementing rules, discriminating against the employee, including actions related to perceived immigration status or work authorization, and maintenance or application of an absence control policy that counts protected leave as an absence that may lead to or result in an adverse action.\n      d.

The protections of this section shall apply to any person who mistakenly but in good faith alleges a violation of this chapter.\n      f. A causal connection between the exercise, attempted exercise, or anticipated exercise of rights protected by this chapter and implementing rules and an employer's adverse action against an employee or a group of employees may be established by indirect or direct evidence.\n      g. For purposes of this section, retaliation is established when it is shown that a protected activity was a motivating factor for an adverse action, whether or not other factors motivated the adverse action.\n      � 20-919. Notice of rights. a. 1. An employer shall provide an employee [either at the commencement of employment or within thirty days of the effective date of this section, whichever is later, with] written notice of such employee's right to safe/sick time and personal time pursuant to this chapter, including the accrual and use of [safe/sick] safe time, sick time and personal time, the calendar year of the employer, and the right to be free from retaliation and to bring a complaint to the department.

Employer records. Employers shall retain records documenting such employer's compliance with the requirements of this chapter for a period of three years unless otherwise required pursuant to any other law, rule or regulation, and shall allow the department to access such records, with appropriate notice and at a mutually agreeable time of day, in furtherance of an investigation conducted pursuant to this chapter. \n      � 20-921.

An employer may not require the disclosure of details relating to an employee's or his or her family member's medical condition or require the disclosure of details relating to an employee's or his or her family member's status as a victim of family offenses, sexual offenses, stalking, or human trafficking as a condition of providing safe/sick time under this chapter.

Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as diminishing the rights of public employees regarding safe time, [or] sick time or personal time as provided pursuant to federal, state or city law. \n      � 20-923. Other legal requirements. a. This chapter provides minimum requirements pertaining to safe time, [and] sick time and personal time and shall not be construed to preempt, limit or otherwise affect the applicability of any other law, regulation, rule, requirement, policy or standard that provides for greater accrual or use by employees of safe leave or time, [or] sick leave or time, or personal leave or time, whether paid or unpaid, or that extends other protections to employees. \n      b. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as creating or imposing any requirement in conflict with any federal or state law, rule or regulation, nor shall anything in this chapter be construed to diminish or impair the rights of an employee or employer under any valid collective bargaining agreement. \n      � 20-924. Enforcement and penalties. a. The department shall enforce the provisions of this chapter.

The notice of violation shall be returnable to the administrative tribunal authorized to adjudicate violations of this chapter. \n      d.

Such relief shall include: (i) for each instance of [sick] safe/sick time or personal time taken by an employee but unlawfully not compensated by the employer: three times the wages that should have been paid under this chapter or two hundred fifty dollars, whichever is greater; (ii) for each instance of [sick] safe/sick time or personal time requested by an employee but unlawfully denied by the employer and not taken by the employee or unlawfully conditioned upon searching for or finding a replacement worker, or for each instance an employer requires an employee to work additional hours without the mutual consent of such employer and employee in violation of section 20-915 of this chapter to make up for the original hours during which such employee is absent pursuant to this chapter: five hundred dollars; (iii) for each instance of unlawful retaliation not including discharge from employment: full compensation including wages and benefits lost, five hundred dollars and equitable relief as appropriate; [and] (iv) for each instance of unlawful discharge from employment: full compensation including wages and benefits lost, two thousand five hundred dollars and equitable relief, including reinstatement, as appropriate; and (v) for each employee covered under an employer's official or unofficial policy or practice of not providing or refusing to allow the use of earned time in violation of section 20-913, five hundred dollars. \n      e.
