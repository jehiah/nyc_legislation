  "Summary": "This bill seeks to mirror recent State law changes by prohibiting landlords from considering refusing to rent to prospective tenants solely because they appear on a “Tenant Blacklist.” Tenant screening lists are used to identify supposedly risky renters by naming tenants who have been involved in a Housing Court case. The bill adds participating in a housing court proceeding to the list of protected classes in the housing accommodations section of the civil rights title of the administrative code.",
