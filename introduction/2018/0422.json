  "Summary": "This proposed law would require property owners of certain private dwellings to test lead levels in soil in certain areas appurtenant to such dwellings at least once a year, and provide a copy of the results of such tests to the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) and any lawful occupants of such dwellings. If results indicate a lead level at or above a soil reference level to be set by DOHMH, such owners would be required to notify DOHMH and occupants of such dwellings, and to cover or remediate the lead-contaminated soil.",
