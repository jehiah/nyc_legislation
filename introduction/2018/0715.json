  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      Section 1.  Title 22 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new chapter 10 to read as follows:\nCHAPTER 10\nCOMMUNITY IMPACT REPORTS\n\n      \t�22-1001.  Definitions.  a. For the purposes of this chapter, the following terms shall have the following meanings:\n      \tDepartment. The term \"department\" means the department of small business services.\n      \tCity economic development entity. The term \"city economic development entity\" means a not-for-profit corporation of which a majority of its members are appointed by the mayor and that is under contract with the department to provide or administer economic development benefits on behalf of the city and expend city capital appropriations in connection therewith.\n      \tEconomic development benefit. The term \"economic development benefit\" means the sale or lease of city-owned land or the provision or administration of financial assistance by the city economic development entity to a person or entity for the purpose of job creation, retention, growth or other economic development project. The term \"economic development benefit\" shall not include: (i) the sale or lease of city-owned property or the provision of financial assistance  in connection with contracts or other agreements for the provision of social services; (ii) as-of-right assistance, tax abatements or benefits, such as those under the Industrial and Commercial Abatement Program, the J-51 Program, and other similar programs; (iii) projects for affordable housing where such affordable housing units shall be affordable to individuals earning less than 120% of area median income and where any market rate housing units created within such project comprise no more than thirty percent of all units created within such project; and (iv) projects that include less than 25,000 square feet of gross commercial space;\n      \tEconomic development project. The term \"economic development project\" means a project undertaken by a person or entity which receives an economic development benefit for such project.\n     \tFinancial assistance. The term \"financial assistance\" means the provision of more than one hundred fifty thousand dollars in cash payments or grants, bond financing, tax abatements or exemptions (including, but not limited to, abatements or exemptions from real property, mortgage recording, sales and use taxes, or the difference between any payments in lieu of taxes and the amount of real property or other taxes that would have been due if the property were not exempted from the payment of such taxes), tax increment financing, filing fee waivers, energy cost reductions, environmental remediation costs, write-downs in the market value of building, land, or leases, or the cost of capital improvements undertaken for the benefit of a project subject to a project agreement. Financial assistance shall include only discretionary assistance that is negotiated or awarded by the city or by a city economic development entity, and shall not include as-of-right assistance, tax abatements or benefits, such as those under the Industrial and Commercial Abatement Program, the J-51 Program, and other similar programs.  Any tax abatement, credit, reduction or exemption that is given to all persons who meet criteria set forth in the state or local legislation authorizing such tax abatement, credit, reduction or exemption shall be deemed to be as-of-right (or non-discretionary); further, the fact that any such tax abatement, credit, reduction or exemption is limited solely by the availability of funds to applicants on a first come, first served or other  non-discretionary basis set forth in such state or local law shall not  render such abatement, credit, reduction or exemption discretionary.  Where assistance takes the form of leasing city property at below-market lease rates, the value of the assistance shall be determined based on the total difference between the lease rate and a fair market lease rate over the duration of the lease. Where assistance takes the form of loans or bond financing, the value of the assistance shall be determined based on the difference between the financing cost to a borrower and the cost to a similar borrower who does not receive financial assistance from the city or a city economic development entity.\n      �22-1002.
