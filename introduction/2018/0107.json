  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Education (DOE) to ensure the Prisoner of War/Missing in Action (POW/MIA) flag is flown over all public property under the care and control of DOE whenever the American flag is flown over such property.",
  "TextID": 61523,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n      Section 1. Legislative intent. The Prisoner of War/Missing in Action (POW/MIA) flag was designed to honor and express the United States' gratitude to those members of the military who have been or remain prisoners of war and those who remain missing in action. The POW/MIA flag is a powerful symbol of our nation's concern and commitment to determining, as fully as possible, the fates of American military personnel still imprisoned or missing overseas. It is the Council's intent to require the POW/MIA flag be flown over every piece of property under the control of the Department of Education whenever the American flag is flown over such property.\n      � 2. The administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new chapter 21 to title 21-A to read as follows:\n      Chapter 21. POW/MIA Flags\n      � 21-988 Displaying a POW/MIA flag over department of education property. a.
