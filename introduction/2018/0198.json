  "Summary": "This bill would exempt the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) from the requirements of Local Law 3 of 2010, that would otherwise require DEP to replace every tree it cuts down when creating or performing work on Bluebelts. The Bluebelt program is administered by DEP on Staten Island and is essentially a storm water management system that involves the protection of natural drainage corridors",
