The bill also would increase the minimum civil penalties for closing a street, blocking a street, or digging without a DOT permit to $10,000. This bill would also increase the criminal penalties for knowingly closing a street, blocking a street, or digging without a DOT permit to maximum one year imprisonment, or a fine of at least $10,000 or both.",
