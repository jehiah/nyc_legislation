  "Summary": "This bill would create an affirmative defense to parking violations issued to motorists who inadvertently park their cars in spots restricted by illegible parking signs. The defense of illegibility would protect motorists from unfair sanctions and possibly also serve as an incentive to replace or repair such illegible parking signs. This defense would apply when both sides of the sign are illegible and there are no other legible signs on the same blockface that apply to the same violation at the same parking space.",
