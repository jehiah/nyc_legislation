  "Summary": "The bill requires the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DoITT) to establish and maintain a website for the public to petition city government.  Once a petition reaches a threshold of electronic signatures it will be submitted to the appropriate agency for review and response. DoITT would also be required to report on agency responses to public petitions and issue an annual report to the Council on the petitions transmitted to each agency, along with the agency response, if any.",
