If such soil is found to have a lead level at or above a soil lead reference level to be set by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), the owners or operators of such facilities would be required to notify DOHMH and to cover or remediate the lead-contaminated soil.","TextID":62951,"Text":"Int. No. 907\n\nBy Council Members Rodriguez, Holden, Cumbo and Kallos\n\n..Title\nA Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to remediating lead soil hazards in certain facilities serving children\n..Body\n\nBe it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n      Section 1.
