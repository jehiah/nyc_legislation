A source that is determined to be renewable by the head of an office or agency designated by the mayor; or\n      3. A source that is determined by such head to have (i) a positive environmental impact or (ii) a substantially lower negative environmental impact than fossil fuel-based energy sources.\n      Green energy system. The term \"green energy system\" means a system that generates energy (i) substantially from one or more green energy sources, in accordance with rules promulgated by an office or agency designated by the mayor, or (ii) wholly from one or more green energy sources.\n      b. 1. On and after January 1, 2050, 100 percent of electricity use by city-owned buildings shall be (i) generated from a green energy system owned or installed by the city or (ii) purchased by the city and generated from a green energy system.\n      c. Every 10 years after the effective date of the local law that added this section, the commissioner of citywide administrative services shall electronically submit to the mayor and speaker of the council, and make publicly available online, a report concerning the implementation of this section, including, but not limited to, the following:\n      1. The percentage of electricity used by city-owned buildings that comes from green energy sources;\n      2. Any difficulties in complying with this section and recommendations for addressing such difficulties;\n      3.

The types of green energy sources currently being used to provide building heating and hot water and the limitations to expanding these sources to additional buildings;\n      5. Identification of building heating and hot water systems or technologies using green energy systems , the current limitations of building heating and hot water systems or technologies and a timeline for when such systems or technologies may be commercially viable for installation in city-owned buildings;\n      6.
