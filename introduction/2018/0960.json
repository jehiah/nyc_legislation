  "Summary": "This local law adds four definitions to Title 24 of the Administrative Code.  The definitions are “heavy-use thoroughfare”, “recreational area”, “regulated air contaminant” and “at risk populations”.  The bill requires the designation of heavy-use thoroughfares, the installation of street level air monitors at a minimum at two major intersections on every designated heavy use thoroughfare and at every recreational area.  The bill also requires the issuance of a report to the mayor and to the speaker of the council containing the results of the air quality monitoring of designated heavy use thoroughfares and recreational areas. \r\n\r\nThe report must be posted on the department’s website annually, and where the results of the air quality monitoring indicate that levels of any regulated air contaminant constitute a violation of an existing standard for that regulated air contaminant or contribute to an actual or potential danger to public health or the environment or present a health risk to at-risk populations the department of environmental protection along with the departments of transportation and education shall collaboratively identify, develop and require the implementation of corrective mitigation measures that significantly reduce or eliminate short-term and long term exposure risks.",

Designation of heavy use thoroughfares shall be based upon verifiable usage and traffic volume data obtained from transportation planning agencies including, but not limited to, the New York metropolitan transportation council, the New York city department of transportation and the New York state department of transportation.\n      (ii) \"Recreational area\" means any park, playground, ball field and school playground that abuts a heavy use thoroughfare.\n      (iii) \"Regulated air contaminant\" means oxides of nitrogen, volatile organic compounds, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or any other air contaminant for which a national ambient air quality standard has been promulgated; or any air contaminant that is regulated under section 112 of the Clean Air Act, as amended. \n      (iv) \"At risk populations\" means infants and children sixteen years of age or younger, pregnant women, adults sixty years of age or older, and persons with weakened immune systems.\n      (2) The department shall, no later than December thirtieth, two thousand eighteen, designate heavy use thoroughfares in every borough.\n      (3) The department shall install street level air monitors at a minimum at two major intersections on every designated heavy use thoroughfare and at every recreational area by December thirtieth, two thousand nineteen.
