Conflicts of interest board. a. There shall be a conflicts of interest board consisting of five members, three members appointed by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council, one member appointed by the comptroller with the advice and consent of the council, and one member appointed by the public advocate with the advice and consent of the council.

No person while a member shall hold any public office, seek election to any public office, be a public employee in any jurisdiction, hold any political party office, or appear as a lobbyist before the city.\n   \tc. Each member shall serve for a term of six years; provided, however, that of the three members [first] appointed by the mayor, one shall be appointed for a term [to expire on March thirty-first, nineteen hundred ninety] of two years, one shall be appointed for a term [to expire on March thirty-first, nineteen hundred ninety-two] of four years and one shall be appointed for a term [to expire on March thirty-first, nineteen hundred ninety-four] of six years, and of the remaining members, one shall be appointed by the comptroller for a term [to expire on March thirty first, nineteen hundred ninety two] of six years and one shall be appointed by the public advocate for a term [to expire on March thirty first, nineteen hundred ninety four] of six years. If the [mayor] appointing authority has not submitted to the council a nomination for appointment of a successor at least sixty days prior to the expiration of the term of the member whose term is expiring, the term of the member in office shall be extended for an additional year and the term of the successor to such member shall be shortened by an equal amount of time. If the council fails to act within forty-five days of receipt of such nomination from the [mayor] appointing authority, the nomination shall be deemed to be confirmed. No member shall serve for more than two consecutive six-year terms.

Any vacancy occurring other than by expiration of a term shall be filled by nomination by the [mayor] appointing authority who appointed the vacating member of the board made to the council within sixty days of the creation of the vacancy, for the unexpired portion of the term of the member succeeded. If the council fails to act within forty-five days of receipt of such nomination from the [mayor] appointing authority, the nomination shall be deemed to be confirmed.\n   \tf. Members may be removed by the [mayor] appointing authority for substantial neglect of duty, gross misconduct in office, inability to discharge the powers or duties of office or violation of this section, after written notice and opportunity for a reply.\n   \tg.
