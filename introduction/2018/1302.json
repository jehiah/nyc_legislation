  "Summary": "This bill would require the Taxi and Limousine Commission to establish a minimum base rate that must be charged for a trip dispatched by any high-volume for-hire service that begins, ends, or passes through the congestion zone. The minimum base rate must be no less than the initial unit charge for a taxi and any required taxes, fees or surcharges.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Subdivision d of section 19-549 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 150 for the year 2018, is amended to read as follows:\n      d. The commission shall by rule establish a minimum base rate to be charged to a passenger for any trip dispatched by a high-volume for-hire service that originates, terminates or passes through the congestion zone, as defined in section 1299 of the tax law. Such minimum base rate shall be no less than the sum of the charge for the initial unit of the metered rate of fare, as established in subparagraph (i) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of section 58-26 of title 35 of the rules of the city of New York, and any taxes, fees or surcharges imposed on trips made by vehicles licensed by the commission. In establishing such minimum base rate, the commission shall consider how the minimum base rate shall apply to pool vehicles, as defined in in section 1299 of the tax law. Following completion of the study required by section 19-550, the commission shall determine whether the establishment of minimum rates of fare to be charged by vehicles licensed by the commission, in addition to the minimum base rate established pursuant to this section, would substantially alleviate any of the problems identified in such study. If the commission determines that such minimum rates of fare would have such an effect, the commission is authorized to establish by rule such minimum rates of fare, provided that such minimum rates of fare shall be no less than the minimum base rate established pursuant to this section. In setting such minimum rates of fare, the commission may consider the category of vehicle, the type of trip, including trips in which the vehicle is available for the transportation of two or more passengers, the rates of fare for other categories of vehicles carrying passengers for hire, including but not limited to taxicabs, the location of the trip, including trips originating, terminating or passing through the hail exclusionary zone, as defined in section 51-03 of title 35 of the rules of the city of New York, and any other factors the commission determines to be appropriate to achieve their intended result. [Such minimum rates of fare shall not include any taxes, fees or surcharges imposed on trips made by vehicles licensed by the commission.] The commission shall, on a periodic basis, but not less than once annually, review such minimum rates of fare in order to determine whether any amendment of such minimum rates of fare is warranted or necessary in order for such minimum rates of fare to continue to achieve their intended result. If the commission determines that such an amendment is warranted or necessary, it is hereby authorized, by rule, to promulgate such amendment.\n      ï¿½ 2.
