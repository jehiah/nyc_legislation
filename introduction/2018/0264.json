  "Summary": "This local law would mandate, with respect to all city-owned, or leased or operated parking lots receiving solar radiation, that the Department of Citywide Administrative Services install all solar canopies that would be cost-effective at each city-controlled parking lot. In addition for each city controlled parking lot a number of parking spaces equal to or greater than 50 percent of the parking spaces covered by such canopies shall be equipped with electrical raceways capable of supporting electric vehicle charging stations  and shall be installed in each city controlled parking lot where a solar canopy is installed. This local law would require reporting every five years on, among other things, the value of energy produced by solar canopies on city-controlled parking lots and a summary of how such energy was used and a description of each factor that has affected the cost-effectiveness of installing solar canopies on city-controlled parking lots.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Chapter 2 of title 4 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 4-211 to read as follows\n      � 4-211 Solar energy generation on city-controlled parking lots. a. As used in this section, the following terms have the following meanings: \n      City-controlled parking lot. The term \"city-controlled parking lot\" means an open parking lot, as such term is defined in the New York city building code, that is city-owned or that is leased or operated by the city under an agreement that would allow the city to install solar canopies on such lot in accordance with this section.\n      Cost-effective. The term \"cost-effective\" means, with respect to the installation of a solar canopy on a city-controlled parking lot, that the sum of the following equals or exceeds the cost of installing such canopy: \n      (A) The expected net present value to the city of the energy to be produced by such canopy over the 25 years following installation of such canopy, or where such lot is not city-owned, over the lesser of 25 years following installation of such canopy or the length of time remaining before the agreement under which the city leases or operates such lot expires or is due to be renewed; and \n      (B) Where such canopy will provide protection from the elements for vehicles parked at such lot, the expected net present value to the city of such protection over the time period described in item (A) of this definition.  \n      Solar canopy. The term \"solar canopy\" means a system designed and constructed to capture solar radiation for the purpose of producing usable energy.\n      b. 1. No later than two years after the effective date of this section, the department of citywide administrative services shall, with the cooperation of all other relevant agencies, install all solar canopies that would be cost-effective at each city-controlled parking lot.\n      2. For each city-controlled parking lot at which solar canopies are installed under this subdivision, a number of parking spaces equal to or greater than 50 percent of the parking spaces covered by such canopies shall be equipped with electrical raceways capable of supporting electric vehicle charging stations in accordance with section 406.7.11 of the New York city building code, notwithstanding any exceptions enumerated in such section, and electric vehicle charging stations shall be installed for such spaces.\n      c. No later than two years after the effective date of this section, and every fifth year thereafter, the department of citywide administrative services shall, with the cooperation of all other relevant agencies, report to the speaker and the mayor the following information for each community district:\n      1. The number of city-controlled parking lots;\n      2. The number of city-controlled parking lots for which installation of solar canopies would be cost-effective;\n3. The number of city-controlled parking lots complying with paragraph two;\n       4. The recommendations of the department of citywide administrative services with respect to continuing or amending the requirements of this section; and\n      5.
