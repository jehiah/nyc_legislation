  "Summary": "This bill would require that, before the Department of Sanitation or Department of Buildings issues a violation to a veterans service organization (VSO), the VSO has a 120-day warning period in which to cure the violation. The relevant department determines by rule which types of violations qualify for the warning period. After the initial 120-day period, the VSO may submit an extension request, including proof of an attempt to cure the violation, to the relevant department. The bill contains a carve-out for safety-threatening violations. The bill also requires the Department of Veterans’ Services to conduct an outreach campaign to VSOs about the cure periods and to post the cure period information on its website. The bill would protect the funds of and educate financially vulnerable VSOs about city regulations.",
