  "Summary": "This bill would require trade waste licensees and registrants to notify the Business Integrity Commission whenever they hire a driver who has a suspended driver’s license or who has been found guilty of reckless driving or driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol in the previous five years.  BIC would have the authority to revoke such licenses or registrations for trade waste companies that engage such individuals as employees or agents for purposes of driving vehicles for such companies.",
