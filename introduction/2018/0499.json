  "Summary": "This bill would amend existing law to allow current and new licensees to hold a newsstand license as a corporate entity, as long as each shareholder, partner, member or principal does not have another source of income exceeding what is earned by operating the newsstand. Existing law only allows newsstand operators to hold their license in their personal capacity.  The bill also contains deeming provisions that would help the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) to enforce a limit on two newsstand locations per licensee. This bill would also prohibit any licensee from renting or attempting to rent out their newsstand; doing so would be a basis for license revocation. Finally, the bill also requires DCWP to mail current newsstand licensees, before their next license renewal, a letter explaining important legal requirements that may be applicable if holding a newsstand license as a corporate entity.  Additionally, Section 20-241 would be repealed and subsequent sections in the subchapter renumbered, to consolidate the requirements and protections in the subchapter.",
