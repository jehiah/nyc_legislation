The bill prohibits the sale of biometric identifier information. It also requires certain commercial establishments, such as retailers, restaurants, and entertainment venues, to post signage notifying consumers if they collect biometric identifier information. The bill provides for a private right of action that allows for judgments of $500 for failing to post signage or negligently selling/sharing biometric information and $5,000 for the intentional or reckless sale of biometric information. The bill requires the Chief Privacy Officer to conduct outreach and education to affected commercial establishments.","TextID":69463,"Text":"Int.
