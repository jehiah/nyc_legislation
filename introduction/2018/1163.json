  "Summary": "This bill would require that permits issued by the Department of Transportation (“DOT”) for work affecting a street segment or intersection with a bicycle lane require that the permit holder maintain a temporary bicycle lane. This bill would also require that DOT provide notice of any permit authorizing work affecting a bicycle lane to the affected borough president, council member and community board.",
  "TextID": 66704,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Subchapter 1 of chapter 1 of title 19 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 19-159.3 to read as follows:\n      � 19-159.3 Temporary bicycle lanes. a. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms have the following meanings:\n      Bicycle lane. The term \"bicycle lane\" means a portion of the roadway that has been marked off or separated for the preferential or exclusive use of bicycles.\n      Temporary bicycle lane. The term \"temporary bicycle lane\" means a bicycle lane intended to be used for a limited period of time during which construction or other work prevents or otherwise affects use of a bicycle lane on a roadway, street segment or intersection.   \n      b. Requirements. Any permit issued by the commissioner authorizing work affecting a street segment or intersection that has a bicycle lane shall include a stipulation requiring that the applicant maintain a temporary bicycle lane, and shall specify the particular manner in which the applicant shall maintain the temporary bicycle lane for such street segment or intersection. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the commissioner determines that maintenance of a temporary bicycle lane is not feasible on such street segment or intersection, such determination shall not prohibit issuance of the permit, provided however that the permit shall set forth such other measures the applicant must take to protect public safety, including persons utilizing bicycles on such street segment or intersection. \n      c.
