  "Summary": "This bill would require the Voter Assistance Advisory Committee to develop and distribute guidance for agencies covered by the Agency Based Voter Registration law on the voting rights of formerly incarcerated persons. It would also require such agencies, as part of their required assistance in completing voter registration forms, to, upon request by a parolee applicant, check if such applicant has had their voting rights restored.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\tSection 1. Paragraph 3 of subdivision b of section 1054 of chapter 46 of the New York city charter, as added by local law number 60 of 2010, is amended to read as follows:\n      3. consistent with all state and local laws, coordinate the activities of all city agencies in general and specialized efforts to increase registration and voting including, but not limited to, the distribution of forms for citizens who use or come in contact with the services of city agencies and institutions; mailings by city agencies to reach citizens; cooperative efforts with non-partisan voter registration groups, community boards, agencies of city, state, and federal governments, and entities doing business in the city; the development and distribution of guidance for agencies designated as participating agencies pursuant to section 1057-a on the voting rights of formerly incarcerated persons; publicity and other efforts to educate youth about the importance of voting and to encourage eligible youth to register to vote; and other outreach programs;\t\n      � 2. The opening paragraph of section 1057-a of the New York city charter, as amended by local law 139 for the year 2016, is amended to read as follows:\n      Each agency designated as a participating agency under the provisions of this section shall implement and administer a program of distribution of voter registration forms pursuant to the provisions of this section. The following offices are hereby designated as participating voter registration agencies: The administration for children's services, the business integrity commission, the city clerk, the civilian complaint review board, the commission on human rights, community boards, the department of small business services, the department for the aging, the department of citywide administrative services, the department of city planning, the department of consumer affairs, the department of correction, the department of cultural affairs, the department of environmental protection, the department of finance, the department of health and mental hygiene, the department of homeless services, the department of housing preservation and development, the department of parks and recreation, the department of probation, the department of records and information services, the taxi and limousine commission, the department of transportation, the department of youth and community development, the fire department, and the human resources administration. Participating agencies shall include a mandate in all new or renewed agreements with those subcontractors having regular contact with the public in the daily administration of their business to follow the guidelines of this section. Such participating agencies shall be required to offer voter registration forms to all persons together with written applications for services, renewal or recertification for services and change of address relating to such services, in the same language as such application, renewal, recertification or change of address form where practicable; provided however that this section shall not apply to services that must be provided to prevent actual or potential danger to the life, health, or safety of any individual or of the public. Such agencies shall provide assistance to applicants in completing voter registration forms, including the section of the form allowing for registration to become an organ donor, and in cases in which such an agency would provide assistance with its own form, such agency shall provide the same degree of assistance with regard to the voter registration and organ donor forms as is provided with regard to the completion of its own form, if so requested. As part of such assistance, such agencies shall also, upon request by an applicant who identifies himself or herself as being on parole and when practically feasible, check publicly available information to inform such applicant if a restoration of their right to vote has been granted, provided that such assistance may be provided by a person other than the person to whom the request was made and further provided that such assistance shall not be considered an endorsement of the accuracy of any publicly available information not maintained by the city. Such agencies shall also receive and transmit the completed application form from any applicants who request to have such form transmitted to the board of elections for the city of New York.\n      � 3.
