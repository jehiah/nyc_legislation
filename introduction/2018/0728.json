  "Summary": "This bill would establish a temporary program for the resolution of outstanding judgments resulting from accessory sign (awning) violations. It would also establish a two-year moratorium on the issuance of additional accessory sign violations, as well as a temporary assistance program to facilitate the re-installation of accessory signs for respondents who have already paid related penalties. The Department of Buildings (DOB) and the Department of Finance would be required to notify the public of the existence of such programs, and DOB and the Department of City Planning would be required to develop an education program to educate the business community about accessory signs and related regulations. This bill would also establish an interagency task force to explore issues related to accessory signs, and requires DOB to provide a report to the Council that contains information about accessory sign violations. Finally, this bill would establish a waiver of all work without a permit penalties issued in relation to the hanging of an accessory sign from December 28, 2017 going forward.",
