The rate recommended by the Banking Commission must be at least equal to the most recently determined federal short-term interest rate. In addition, the local law would repeal provisions requiring the Banking Commission to make certain recommendations for interest rates for the nonpayment of water and sewer rents because those provisions are preempted by a State law setting such interest rates.","TextID":64343,"Text":"Preconsidered Int.
