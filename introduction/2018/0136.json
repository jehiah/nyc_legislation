  "Summary": "This bill would clarify which workers are protected by the City Human Rights Law. In particular, the bill would clarify how to determine whether an employer has four or more employees (which triggers some of the obligations of the City Human Rights Law) and that an employer’s parent, spouse, domestic partner or child if employed by an employer are included as in the employ of such employer. This bill would make explicit that section 8-107(23) applies to freelancers and independent contractors.",
