  "Summary": "This bill would clarify which workers are protected by the City Human Rights Law. In particular, the bill would clarify how to determine whether an employer has four or more employees (which triggers some of the obligations of the City Human Rights Law) and that an employer’s parent, spouse, domestic partner or child if employed by an employer are included as in the employ of such employer. This bill would make explicit that section 8-107(23) applies to freelancers and independent contractors.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n      Section 1. Section 8-102 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law 98 for the year 2018, is amended to read as follows: \n\tEmployer. For purposes of subdivisions 1, 2, 3, 11-a, and 22, subparagraph 1 of paragraph a of subdivision 21, [and] paragraph e of subdivision 21 and subdivision 23 of section 8-107, the term \"employer\" does not include any employer [with] that has fewer than four persons in the employ of such employer at all times during the period beginning twelve months before the start of an unlawful discriminatory practice and continuing through the end of such unlawful discriminatory practice, provided however, that in an action for unlawful discriminatory practice based on a claim of gender-based harassment pursuant to subdivision one of section 8-107, the term \"employer\" shall include any employer, including those with fewer than four persons in their employ.
