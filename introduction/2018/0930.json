Further, the bill would require operators or agents to disclose what portion of the total ticket price the service fee represents. Currently, operators or agents regularly conceal these fees until the final stages of a transaction. By requiring early disclosure, this bill would allow consumers to make more informed decisions before beginning a transaction.","TextID":62803,"Text":"Int.
