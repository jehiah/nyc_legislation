  "Summary": "The proposed local law would require the Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) to conduct a year-long pilot program that would utilize collision avoidance technology on no less than 100 City fleet vehicles. The proposed legislation would also require DCAS to produce a report at the end of the pilot program discussing the impact of such technology on the incidence of vehicle accidents, the cost of such technology, and recommendations for expanding the use of such technology.",
