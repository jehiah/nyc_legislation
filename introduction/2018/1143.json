  "Summary": "Currently, when property owner owes property tax arrears they may enter into an installment agreement with the Department of Finance to pay off the debt over a period of up to ten years with a zero dollar down payment. The installment amounts are then calculated based on the amount owed, interest rates, and pay-off period, but without regard for income or ability to pay.  This local law would create three income-based installment agreements for eligible one- to three- family and condominium property owners where such property is the primary residence. All three installment agreements would be available only to property owners with combined incomes of $58,399 or less. The senior low-income installment agreement would allow property owners who are at least 65 years old to defer payment of a percentage of their tax arrears and prospective tax liability until the termination of the installment agreement upon expiration, death, or transfer. The fixed-length income-based installment agreement would allow property owners to pay off tax arrears and one year of prospective tax liability by paying installments based on a percentage of income until the debt is repaid. Finally, the extenuating circumstances income-based installment agreement would allow property owners with extenuating circumstances (such as loss of income due to unemployment, death, treatment of an illness, military service, or involuntary absence) to enter into a one-year installment agreement to pay off tax arrears and property taxes that accrue during that year by paying installments based on a percentage of income. A property that is the subject of one of the installment agreements would be exempt from the tax lien sale. The current ten-year, zero down payment plan would continue to exist alongside these new payment plan options.",

A lien sold in a tax lien sale before the date of an application for an installment agreement is not eligible to be included in an installment agreement under this section.\n      3. The applicant may choose to include the cost of the title search required to be submitted with an application pursuant to subparagraph (a) of paragraph 1 of subdivision g of this section in the amount subject to the installment agreement. If an applicant chooses to include such cost, the applicant may either select a title company to conduct the required search and present documentation to the department of the cost, or direct the department to use a title company selected by the department. The department shall pay the cost of the title search and be reimbursed by the applicant through the addition of the cost to the amount subject to the installment agreement. The applicant shall make such reimbursement in the first year of the installment agreement, in monthly or quarterly payments, consistent with the payment frequency selected for the installment agreement. The cost of the title search shall bear interest at the same rate as the interest on unpaid real property tax as provided in section 11-224.1 of the code.\n      4. (a) Any time the amount of the liens on a property subject to an installment agreement under this section exceeds 25 percent of the net equity in such property, the applicant shall pay all taxes and charges imposed against the property that exceed 25 percent of the net equity in the property as such taxes and charges become due, in addition to the payment amount set forth in the installment agreement. \n      (b) Notwithstanding subparagraph (a) of this paragraph and provided that section 581 of the real property tax law is in effect in the same form as such section was in effect as of the effective date of the local law that added this section, for property that is a dwelling unit in a condominium subject to an installment agreement under this section and for which an appraisal has not been obtained pursuant to paragraph 4 of subdivision g of this section, any time the amount of the liens subject to such agreement exceeds 50 percent of the net equity in such property, the applicant shall pay all taxes and charges imposed against such property that exceed 50 percent of the net equity in such property as such taxes and charges become due, in addition to the payment amount set forth in the installment agreement. For property that is a dwelling unit in a condominium and for which an appraisal has been obtained pursuant to paragraph 4 of subdivision g of this section, any time the amount of the liens subject to an installment agreement under this section exceeds the higher of (i) 50 percent of the net equity in such property based on the fair market value determined by the department; or (ii) 25 percent of the net equity in such property based on the fair market value determined by the appraisal obtained by the applicant, the applicant shall pay all taxes and charges imposed against such property that exceed the higher of the amounts described by clause (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph as such taxes and charges become due, in addition to the payment amount set forth in the installment agreement.    \n      (c) The department shall provide each applicant with a written projection at the time the installment agreement is entered into as to when the 25 or 50 percent threshold, as determined pursuant to subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this paragraph, will be exceeded. The department shall also notify each property owner in writing when the amount of the liens exceeds such threshold. Failure by the department to provide an applicant with such projection or to notify a property owner when the amount of the liens exceeds the applicable threshold, however, shall not affect the validity of the installment agreement that has been entered into, nor shall any claim arise or exist against the commissioner of finance or any officer or agency of the city by reason of such failure to provide such projection or such notification.   \n      5. If at any time the department determines that the fair market value of a property subject to an installment agreement under this section has increased, an applicant may request that the net equity in such property be recalculated and the net equity amount included in such installment agreement be adjusted to reflect the recalculated net equity in such property.\n      6. If the combined income of all of the property owners exceeds $58,399 for the income tax year immediately preceding the date of making a renewal application pursuant to subdivision h of this section, the applicant shall pay all taxes and charges imposed against the property after the date of such renewal application as such taxes and charges become due, in addition to the payment amount set forth in such installment agreement.\n      k. Termination of installment agreement. 1. An installment agreement shall be terminated when any of the following occurs:\n      (a) The property whose liens are the subject of such installment agreement is no longer the primary residence of the applicant. An applicant whose installment agreement has been terminated because of such reason may apply to enter into an installment agreement pursuant to section 11-322.\n      (b) The fixed term of the installment agreement expires. An applicant whose installment agreement has been terminated because of such expiration may apply to enter into an installment agreement pursuant to section 11-322 or to this section.\n      (c) The applicant is deceased.\n      (d) The applicant opts out of an installment agreement without a fixed term as described in paragraph 1 of subdivision l of this section. An applicant who opts out of such agreement may apply to enter into an installment agreement pursuant to section 11-322 or to this section.\n      (e) The applicant does not file a timely renewal application in accordance with the provisions of subdivision h of this section.\n      (f) The applicant is in default and has not cured such default as provided in subparagraph (a) of paragraph 3 of this subdivision prior to the next tax lien sale.\n      (g) The applicant has defaulted on the installment agreement and has cured such default by entering into a new installment agreement pursuant to clause (2) or (3) of subparagraph (a) of paragraph 3 of this subdivision. \n      2. If an installment agreement is terminated, all taxes and charges that accrued before such termination are required to be paid. If such taxes and charges are not paid within nine months of such termination, the tax lien or tax liens on such property may be sold. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if an agreement is terminated pursuant to subparagraph (c) of paragraph 1 of this subdivision, a surviving spouse has 18 months from the death of the applicant to pay all taxes and charges on such property before the tax lien or tax liens on such property may be sold. If such surviving spouse is a property owner he or she may enter into a separate installment agreement pursuant to section 11-322 or subdivision l, m or n of this section, as long as he or she meets the eligibility requirements for the respective installment agreement. \n      3. Cure of default. (a) An applicant may cure a default by:\n      (1) bringing all installment payments and all current charges, including but not limited to any interest and fees, that are outstanding at the time of the default to a current status prior to the date of the tax lien sale;\n      (2) entering into a new installment agreement with a down payment of 20 percent, or more, of all delinquent real property taxes, assessments, sewer rents, sewer surcharges, water rents and other charges that are made a lien subject to the provisions of this chapter, including any outstanding interest and fees, prior to the date of such sale; or\n      (3) entering into a new installment agreement under this section if the department has made a finding of extenuating circumstances pursuant to the process described in paragraph (4) of subdivision (e) of section 40-03 of title 19 of the rules of the city of New York. \n      (b) If a default is not cured prior to the date of the tax lien sale, such applicant shall not be eligible to enter into an installment agreement for the subject property for five years, unless the department has made a finding of extenuating circumstances pursuant to the process described in paragraph (4) of subdivision (e) of section 40-03 of title 19 of the rules of the city of New York. \n      (c) Notwithstanding the prohibition in subparagraph (b) of this paragraph against entering into an installment agreement for the subject property for five years, an applicant who has defaulted on an installment agreement and whose lien has been sold and, after the sale of the lien, whose property on which the lien was sold is subject to another tax lien that is eligible to be sold, may apply to enter into another installment agreement with respect to such other lien before the end of such five-year period, provided that such applicant makes a down payment of 20 percent, or more, of all delinquent real property taxes, assessments, sewer rents, sewer surcharges, water rents and other charges that are made a lien subject to the provisions of this chapter, including any outstanding interest and fees, prior to the date of the tax lien sale. An applicant shall not be eligible to enter an installment agreement with a down payment under this subparagraph more than once for the subject property.\n      (d) If a property owner who has entered into an installment agreement with the department pursuant to this section fails to make a payment pursuant to such agreement, the department shall, after the first missed payment, mail a letter or send an email, when such address is known, to the property owner stating that such owner is at risk of being in default of such agreement. The letter or email shall be sent after the first missed payment if the department has not received payment within two weeks of the due date. Failure by the department to mail such letter or send such email, however, shall not affect the validity of the installment agreement that has been entered into, nor shall any claim arise or exist against the commissioner of finance or any officer or agency of the city by reason of such failure to mail such letter or send such email. \n      l. Senior low-income installment agreement. 1. At the option of the applicant, a senior low-income installment agreement may provide for payments for a fixed period of time or for payments without a fixed period of time. If the applicant selects an installment agreement with a fixed time period, the applicant may select the term of the agreement. The applicant may switch from an installment agreement without a fixed time period to an installment agreement with a fixed time period, or from an installment agreement with a fixed time period to an installment agreement without a fixed time period, at any point.\n      2. A senior low-income installment agreement shall provide for the payment of both a percentage of taxes and charges that have accrued, if any, and a percentage of taxes and charges that will accrue after the date of the installment agreement. The applicant may elect to pay an installment amount based on zero percent, 25 percent, 50 percent or 75 percent of the annual taxes and charges that have accrued, if any, and that will accrue. If the applicant selects an agreement with a fixed time period, the required payment shall be based on the percentage selected and the term selected. If the applicant selects an agreement without a fixed time period, the required payment shall be based on the percentage selected for prospective taxes and charges and a partial or full payment of the percentage of taxes and charges that have accrued, if any. The applicant may adjust the payment percentage at any point during the installment agreement, but may not make more than one such adjustment during any six-month period.\n      m. Fixed length income-based installment agreement. 1. At the option of the applicant, a fixed length income-based installment agreement pursuant to this subdivision may provide for the payment of (i) only taxes and charges that have accrued or (ii) taxes and charges that have accrued and taxes and charges that will accrue over the next fiscal year. If option (i) is selected, the applicant shall pay all taxes and charges that become due on the property after the installment agreement is entered into in addition to the payment schedule provided in the installment agreement. If option (ii) is selected, the applicant shall pay all taxes and charges that will accrue on the property after the installment agreement has been in effect for one year in addition to the payment schedule provided in the installment agreement.\n      2. The annual payment amount required pursuant to an installment agreement described by this subdivision shall be based on a percentage of the combined income of all of the property owners for the income tax year immediately preceding the initial application for such installment agreement. The applicant may select a percentage of two percent, four percent, six percent or eight percent of such combined income. The installment payment shall be calculated by dividing the annual payment amount by 12 or four, depending on whether a monthly or quarterly payment schedule is selected. The term of the agreement shall be calculated by dividing the taxes and charges included in the agreement pursuant to paragraph 1 of this subdivision by the installment payment determined by the calculation described in this paragraph.\n      3. An applicant may adjust the payment percentage at any point during the installment agreement, but may not make more than one such adjustment during any six-month period. \n      n. Extenuating circumstances income-based installment agreement. 1. An extenuating circumstances income-based installment agreement shall provide for the payment, during the period of such agreement, of a percentage of taxes and charges that have accrued on the property and taxes and charges that accrue after the date of the installment agreement.\n      2. The annual payment amount required pursuant to an installment agreement described by this subdivision shall be based on a percentage of the combined income of all of the property owners for the income tax year immediately preceding the initial application for an installment agreement. The applicant may select a percentage of two percent, four percent, six percent, or eight percent of such combined income. Such installment payment shall be calculated by dividing the annual payment amount by 12 or four, depending on whether a monthly or quarterly payment schedule is selected. The installment agreement shall be for a term of one year but may be extended on a yearly basis if the department determines that the extenuating circumstances continue. \n      3. An applicant may adjust the payment percentage at any point during the installment agreement, but may not make more than one such adjustment during any six-month period. \n      o. After an applicant has entered into an installment agreement with the department pursuant to this section, the department shall record the entry of such agreement on the automated city register information access system. Failure by the department to record such agreement, however, shall in no manner affect the validity of such agreement, nor shall any claim arise or exist against the commissioner of finance or any officer or agency of the city by reason of such failure to record.\n      p. All installment agreements executed pursuant to this section on or after the effective date of the local law that added this subdivision shall include:\n      1.  a statement that if payments required from an applicant pursuant to such an agreement are not made for a period of six months, such applicant shall be in default of such agreement, and the tax lien or tax liens on the subject property may be sold, provided, however, that such default may be cured upon such applicant's bringing all installment payments and all current charges that are outstanding at the time of the default to a current status, which shall include, but not be limited to, any outstanding interest and fees, prior to the date of the tax lien sale; \n      2. a notification that if such default is not cured prior to the date of the tax lien sale, such property owner shall not be eligible to enter into an installment agreement for the subject property for five years, unless a finding of extenuating circumstances has been made by the department pursuant to the process described in paragraph (4) of subdivision (e) of section 40-03 of title 19 of the rules of the city of New York; \n      3. the definition of extenuating circumstances pursuant to such paragraph;\n      4. a statement describing the conditions under which the property owner may be eligible, after default, to enter into another installment agreement in accordance with paragraph 3 of subdivision k of this section; and\n      5. the date by which the applicant must submit a renewal application each year.\n      q.
