  "Summary": "This bill would establish a civil service exam fee task force. The task force, which would meet quarterly and hold at least two public meetings, would consist of public officials, a Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) employee with experience in developing civil service exams or setting exam fees and a civil service labor union representative. The task force would be required to submit to the Mayor and Speaker of the Council a cost analysis report on the number of people taking, for the very first time, a civil service exam administered by DCAS and the relevant exam fees. In addition, the task force would be required to submit to the Mayor and Speaker recommendations to mitigate costs for individuals taking such an exam for the very first time.",
