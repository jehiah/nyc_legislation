  "Summary": "This bill would codify the three-quarter housing task force. The task force would be comprised of representatives from the Human Resources Administration, Department of Buildings, the Fire Department, the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, and the Mayor’s Office. It would be tasked with inspecting dwellings suspected to be three-quarters houses. The task force would identify buildings where ten or more unrelated adults are living and issue violations. The task force would also be charged with offering informational assistance to individuals living in three-quarter houses in order to relocate to permanent housing. The Mayor’s Office or a city agency would be required to publish quarterly findings of the task force as well as information on whether individuals relocating from three-quarter housing were given a rental subsidy and obtained permanent or temporary housing.",
