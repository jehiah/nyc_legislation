  "Summary": "This legislation would allow individuals to change the sex designation on their birth record to conform to the individual’s gender identity. The application would be supported by a signed and notarized statement by the individual, attesting that the request for a change of gender to female, male, or “X” is to conform the person’s legal gender to the person’s gender identity. The term “X” means a gender that is not exclusively male or female.  Currently, individuals requesting to correct the gender on their birth certificates must submit affidavits from licensed physicians or medical professionals attesting that the changed sex designation more accurately reflects the applicant’s gender identity.",
