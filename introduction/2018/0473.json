  "Summary": "When 911 operators or dispatchers need to call an individual back, the number displayed is not “911” or a working phone number, which may cause individuals to miss or ignore 911 return calls. This bill would require the Department of Information Technology & Telecommunications, in its annual report on the implementation of the NextGeneration 911 system, to include a description of the feasibility of providing accurate 911 caller identification information when 911 call takers or dispatchers return 911 calls and a description of the feasibility of providing confirmation numbers for 911 calls. These features may help to promote the safety and protection of New Yorkers by allowing individuals to easily identify return calls from 911 and have a record of calls made to 911.",
