  "Summary": "The local law amends Title 24 of the New York City Administrative Code, adding a new section (h) to 24-163 to prohibit idling for more than one minute adjacent to a plainly identified senior citizen center, effective immediately. The bill provides exemptions for when a vehicle is used to operate a loading, unloading or processing device, for mechanical work when required, to maintain an appropriate temperature for passenger comfort or in emergency evacuations where necessary to operate wheelchair lifts.",
