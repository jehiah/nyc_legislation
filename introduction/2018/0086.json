  "Summary": "This bill would require persons who assemble or evaluate screening reports containing court history of residential tenants and applicants for residential housing to be licensed by the Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA). The bill would also require that all tenant screening reports contain certain information about each court proceeding referenced in the report. Finally, the bill would grant DCA enforcement authority, would establish civil penalties for violations, and would create a private right of action for tenants and prospective tenants injured by violations.",

In any action under this section, a court shall award reasonable attorney's fees and costs to a prevailing plaintiff.\n      d. The issuance of a tenant screening report that the tenant screening bureau knew or should have known contained inaccurate information or otherwise violated this subchapter constitutes an injury for purposes of this subdivision. This subdivision does not limit the types of other injuries that are legally cognizable under this section.\n      e. A tenant or prospective tenant who institutes an action pursuant to this section shall provide notice of such action to the commissioner. The corporation counsel may intervene in any such action on behalf of the city. \n      f.
