  "Summary": "This bill would amend the Administrative Code in relation to the licensing and conduct of bingo and games of chance. Many Administrative Code provisions governing bingo and games of chance are antiquated and more stringent than State law. This bill amends and repeals certain Administrative Code provisions to ease the restrictions on bingo and games of chance in New York City and to limit the regulation of such games to the broader State law requirements.",
