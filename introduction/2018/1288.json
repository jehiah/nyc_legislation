Any reference in this charter, the administrative code or any other local law to the thresholds for eligibility for public funding for participating candidates for the offices of mayor, public advocate or comptroller set forth in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of paragraph (a) of subdivision 2 of section 3-703 of the administrative code shall be deemed a reference to this subdivision.\n      ï¿½ 2.

Such statement shall be made on the date of the filing of the first disclosure report required pursuant to section 3-703 of the administrative code, provided that candidates seeking office in a covered primary, run-off primary, or general election held in the year 2021 who intend to participate in such system who filed such first disclosure report prior to January 12, 2019 shall file such non-binding written statement with the campaign finance board no later than July 15, 2019, and provided further that such non-binding written statement shall not be required if a candidate has already complied with clause (ii) of this subparagraph as of the date of the filing of the first disclosure report. Failure to file the statement required pursuant to this clause (i) shall not be deemed to preclude a candidate from choosing to participate in the voluntary system of campaign finance reform described in this section and chapter 7 of title 3 of the administrative code pursuant to paragraph (c) of subdivision 1 of section 3-703.\n      (ii) Participating candidates seeking office in covered elections held prior to the covered primary election to be held in the year 2021 and covered primary, run-off primary, and general elections held in the year 2021, shall state in the written certification filed pursuant to paragraph (c) of subdivision 1 of section 3-703 of the administrative code, whether they agree to the terms, conditions, and requirements for contribution limits and for the provision of public matching funds, including those pertaining to the matching formula, qualifying threshold, public funds cap, and distribution schedule, under Option A or Option B provided in clause (iii) of this subparagraph, provided that participating candidates seeking office in a covered primary, run-off primary, or general election held in the year 2021 who filed such certification prior to January 12, 2019 shall file an amended certification with such information with the campaign finance board no later than January 15, 2021, and further provided that participating candidates seeking office in a covered special election to fill a vacancy held in the year 2019 who filed such certification prior to January 12, 2019 and did not indicate a choice of Option A or Option B in such certification shall file an amended certification with such information with the campaign finance board no later than January 15, 2019.\n      (iii) Option A.

Subparagraph (i) of paragraph (b) of subdivision 5 of section 3-709.5 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\n      Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (ii) below, each debate for a primary, general or special election shall include only those participating candidates or limited participating candidates the sponsor of each such debate has determined meet the non-partisan, objective, and non-discriminatory criteria set forth in any agreement between the sponsor and the board; provided, however, that the criteria for the first debate for a primary[,] or general[, or special] election shall include financial criteria requiring that a participating candidate or limited participating candidate shall be eligible to participate in such debate if he or she has, by the last filing date prior to such debate, (I) raised, and (II) spent, an amount equal to or more than two and one half percent of the expenditure limitation provided in subdivision one of section 3-706 for the office for which such candidate seeks nomination for election or election; provided, further, that the criteria for the first debate for a special election shall include financial criteria requiring that a participating candidate or limited participating candidate shall be eligible to participate in such debate if he or she has, by the last filing date prior to such debate, (I) raised, and (II) spent, an amount equal to or more than one and one quarter percent of the expenditure limitation provided in subdivision one of section 3-706 for the office for which such candidate seeks election; and provided, further, that the second debate for a primary, general, or special election shall include only those participating candidates or limited participating candidates who the sponsors have also determined are leading contenders on the basis of additional non-partisan, objective, and non-discriminatory criteria set forth in any agreement between the sponsor and the board. For the purpose of determining whether a participating candidate or limited participating candidate has met the financial criteria to be eligible to participate in any debate, only contributions raised and spent in compliance with the act shall be used to determine [whether] the amount that the candidate has raised and spent [two point five percent] as a percentage of the expenditure limit provided in subdivision one of section 3-706; further, money \"raised\" and \"spent\" does not include outstanding liabilities or loans. Nothing in this provision is intended to limit the debates to the two major political parties.\n      ï¿½ 5.
