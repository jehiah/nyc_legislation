  "Summary": "This bill would apply the campaign finance system that Ballot Question #1, as approved by voters in the 2018 general election, established for the 2021 elections to covered elections prior to the 2021 primary election, including special elections held in 2019.",
  "TextID": 64557,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\tSection 1. Paragraph 18 of subdivision a of section 1052 of the New York city charter, as added by a ballot question approved by the voters in the 2018 general election, is amended to read as follows:\n      18. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the threshold for eligibility for public funding for participating candidates in a primary or general election[, or special election to fill a vacancy,] shall be in the case of: (i) mayor, not less than $250,000 in matchable contributions comprised of sums up to $250 per contributor including at least 1,000 matchable contributions of $10 or more; and (ii) public advocate and comptroller, not less than $125,000 in matchable contributions comprised of sums of up to $250 per contributor including at least 500 matchable contributions of $10 or more; provided that the threshold dollar amount of summed matchable contributions shall be halved for any special election to fill a vacancy for mayor, public advocate or comptroller. The thresholds for eligibility for public funding for participating candidates for the offices of mayor, public advocate or comptroller described in this paragraph shall replace the thresholds for eligibility for public funding for participating candidates for the offices of mayor, public advocate or comptroller set forth in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of paragraph (a) of subdivision 2 of section 3-703 of the administrative code and shall be applied to the same extent and in the same manner and subject to the same restrictions as described in this section and chapter 7 of title 3 of the administrative code.
