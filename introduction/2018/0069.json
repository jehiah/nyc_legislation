As part of the new docking permit condition, the Department would require of the proprietors that the number of designated parking spaces equal or exceed 50 percent of the legal capacity of each proprietor’s boat. The Department would also require that the designated parking spaces be located within three city blocks of each commercial recreational boat’s docking location.","TextID":60262,"Text":"Int.
