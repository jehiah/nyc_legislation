  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Correction (“DOC”) to ensure that all incarcerated individuals who require an escort to a medical facility be provided such escort within a reasonable period of time. It also requires the DOC to publish a quarterly report on its website containing both the average and median amount of time between which an escort is requested by an incarcerated individual and when such escort actually occurred.",
