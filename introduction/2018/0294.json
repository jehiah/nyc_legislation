  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) to create a pilot program on the use of low emission exhaust pipes. The pilot program would encompass twenty percent of all motor vehicles owned by the city of New York that are run not exclusively by electric power, because they are already zero emission vehicles. The bill would also require DCAS to provide a written report to the Speaker of the Council and post on its website not more than one year following the start of the pilot program. The report would include the cost of the pilot program and the emissions reduction from this program.",
