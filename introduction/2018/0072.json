  "Summary": "This bill would require operators of certain amusement park rides to notify 911 immediately any time such a ride must be evacuated. The bill would also set penalties for violations and would define “evacuate,” and would also require the Police Department and the Fire Department to notify the Department of Consumer Affairs and the Department of Buildings within 24 hours after such a 911 call is placed. \r\n\r\nThe bill would also make technical changes to existing provisions, namely alphabetizing the definitions to which the definition of “evacuate” is being added, renumbering duplicate sections in the same subchapter, and adding a heading to one such section that was adopted without one.",
