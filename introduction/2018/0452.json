  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Education to report demographic and other information concerning middle school students in grades 6-12 who attend Alternate Learning Centers (ALCs) as a result of suspensions from their originating schools lasting five or more days. Such information would include race, ethnicity, gender and languages spoken at home. It would also include data concerning pre-suspension due process, ALC teacher training credentials, and post suspension transitions back to an originating school or to other institutions, such as correctional facilities.",
