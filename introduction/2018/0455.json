Electricity for such electric vehicles shall be generated on-site. This local law further requires  that all other school buses, shall, after ten years of  use, be replaced by  compressed  natural  gas, hybrid school buses or all electric, and further provides that use of such compressed natural gas or hybrid school buses  is limited to ten years and such school buses must thereafter be replaced with all electric zero emission school buses, and as long as the particulate matter emissions  of all such school buses does not exceed emission levels permitted in  the  most  recent  diesel  engine  emissions  standards issued by the United States  Environmental Protection Agency and the mileage meets the most recent corporate average fuel economy standards for compact and large trucks.","TextID":61728,"Text":"Int.
