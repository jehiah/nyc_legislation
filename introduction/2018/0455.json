  "Summary": "This local law would require the City to ensure that  all school buses in use by September 1, 2035 shall be all-¬electric zero emission school buses. The replacement of school buses shall be subject to the commercial availability and reliability of all-electric zero emission school buses, and the technical and physical availability of related planned infrastructure, including but not limited to charging stations and bus depots for all-electric zero emission school buses. This local law would also require the DOE to report to the Mayor and the Speaker on a variety of implementation targets within three reporting deadlines: July 1 of 2023, 2028, and 2033.",
