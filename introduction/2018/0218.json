  "Summary": "This legislation would require the Department of Housing and Preservation and Development (“HPD”), in conjunction with the Department of Finance (“DOF”), to promulgate rules establishing a preservation trust program which would allow for the negotiated sale of tax liens on distressed properties to a trust created for the purpose of rehabilitating and preserving affordable housing. The legislation would also authorize DOF to sell such tax liens to a trust eligible under the preservation trust program and expand the definition of distressed property.",
