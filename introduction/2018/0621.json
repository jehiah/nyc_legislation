The number and percentage of inspections for rat activity for properties within a given sanitation district or community district that have resulted in the issuance of a notice of violation pursuant to section 3.05 or section 151.02 of the New York city health code, and the location of such properties within such sanitation or community district;\n      3. The number of rat exterminations at properties within a given sanitation district or community district executed by the department pursuant to section 17-147 of this code, following a failure to comply with an order issued pursuant to section 151.02 of the New York city health code, and the location of such properties within such sanitation or community district;\n      4.
