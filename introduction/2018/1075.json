  "TextID": 64522,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      Section 1. As used in this law, the following terms have the following meanings: \n      Commissioner. The term \"commissioner\" means the commissioner of sanitation.\n      Department. The term \"department\" means the department of sanitation.\n      Institution. The term \"institution\" means a not-for-profit corporation receiving department collection service.\n      Organic waste. The term \"organic waste\" means organic waste as defined in section 16-303 of the administrative code of the city of New York. \n      Pilot program. The term \"pilot program\" means a program established pursuant to this law by the commissioner for the curbside collection of organic waste from selected buildings wholly occupied by one or more city agencies and institutional special use buildings. \n      Special use building. The term \"special use building\" means any premise or structure during the period in which any such premise or structure is exempt from real estate taxation by the city.\n      � 2. No later than July 1, 2019, the department shall establish a pilot program, in consultation with the department of citywide administrative services, in no fewer than three boroughs. Such pilot program shall include a total of no fewer than 15 buildings wholly occupied by one or more city agencies. Such 15 buildings shall include no fewer than 10 city-owned buildings containing the administrative offices of one or more city agencies. Such pilot program may also include institutional special use buildings. Such pilot program shall continue through at least June 30, 2021.  \n      � 3. The commissioner shall have the authority, during the duration of the pilot program, to discontinue curbside collection of organic waste to a building wholly occupied by a city agency or an institutional special use building, provided, however, that the commissioner may select a replacement building wholly occupied by one or more city agencies or an institutional special use building to receive organic waste curbside collection service within 60 days of any such discontinuation. If any such discontinuation results in fewer than 15 buildings wholly occupied by one or more city agencies or fewer than 10 city-owned buildings containing the administrative offices of one or more city agencies being included in the pilot program, the commissioner shall select a replacement building of the same type as the building that was removed from the pilot program. \n      � 4. The department shall conduct outreach and education to occupants of buildings participating in the pilot program. Such outreach and education shall include, but need not be limited to, instructions on how to properly source separate organic waste for curbside collection and the environmental benefits of reducing and composting organic waste. The department shall also provide any necessary equipment, including separate bins for the disposal of organic waste, to occupants of buildings participating in such pilot program.\n      � 5. No later than October 31, 2021, the commissioner shall submit a report to the mayor and the speaker of the city council on the pilot program, which shall include, but need not be limited to, information on: (i) the number of buildings participating in the pilot program, disaggregated by buildings wholly occupied by one or more city agencies, institutional special use buildings, and city-owned buildings containing the administrative offices of one or more city agencies; (ii) amount of organic waste diverted; (iii) outreach and education conducted, including number of trainings and number of individuals who have participated in such trainings, if applicable, and materials provided; (iv) the costs associated with the pilot program, including costs for outreach, bins and labor; (v) feedback from occupants of buildings participating in the pilot program concerning such pilot program, including the adequacy of the receptacles used for such pilot program and any other issues of concern; (vi) a list of buildings that had organics collection discontinued during the pilot program and the reason for such discontinuation; and (vii) a list of buildings that were considered for the pilot program and, if applicable, the reasons such buildings were not included. The department shall disaggregate such information by agency, building address, and borough, block and lot. Such report shall include recommendations as to whether the pilot program should be expanded and, if so, a schedule for expanding such pilot program.    \n      � 6. This local law takes effect immediately and shall expire and be deemed repealed upon receipt of the report due pursuant to section five of this local law.  \n      \n\n\nLS# 4684\nNKA\n12/12/2018\n8:07p\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2",
