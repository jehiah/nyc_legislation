  "Summary": "This bill would require the department of parks and recreation to conduct a survey of the area within a 10 foot radius of a proposed tree planting site to confirm that planting a tree at such site will not interfere with usage of the street or sidewalk or interfere with water pipes, sewers, or other infrastructure near or underneath the tree.  The department of parks and recreation must make each completed tree-planting survey available online on its website.",
