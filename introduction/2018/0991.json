  "Summary": "This bill would authorize the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings (“OATH”) to dismiss a violation enforced by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (“TLC”) pertaining to a defective vehicle lights so long as two conditions are met: the driver or owner must have fixed the light no later one day after being issued a violation, and the driver must provide proof of correction, such as a statement of correction issued by a state inspection authority or auto repair shop, along with the TLC summons, to the TLC. Once the TLC, upon inspection of proof, determines that the driver or owner corrected the light, it would then recommend that OATH dismiss the violation.",
