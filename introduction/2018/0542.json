  "Summary": "The bill would require the Mayor’s Office to End Domestic and Gender Based Violence (ENDGBV) to provide individuals receiving services at Family Justice Centers (FJCs) with service satisfaction surveys. FJCs would be required to post a sign indicating the availability of the surveys in a conspicuous location, although completion of the survey by FJC clients would not be mandatory and would be anonymous. ENDGBV would be required to submit to the Speaker of the Council and post on its website on an annual basis the survey questions and all survey data, disaggregated by borough, type of service received, and language information.",
