This bill would also require mercantile occupancies that are part of a mixed-use building to create a fire and emergency preparedness plan. A fire and emergency preparedness plan provides for the procedures that can be timely implemented in the event of a fire or non-fire emergency to provide the information, guidance, direction and assistance needed to protect the safety of building occupants.","TextID":64352,"Text":"Int.
