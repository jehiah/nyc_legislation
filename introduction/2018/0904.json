  "Summary": "This bill would require the DOHMH, whenever it receives a report of a pregnant person with an elevated blood lead level, to conduct an investigation to identify potential sources of such elevated blood lead level, and after the birth of a child, monitor such child for elevated blood lead levels and assess whether the apartment where such child resides contains any lead-based paint or unsafe lead paint. In addition, DOHMH is required to conduct outreach to new and expecting parents regarding the availability of inspections for peeling paint, or a deteriorated subsurface or underlying defect in their apartment, and to provide them with information about blood lead testing for children, unsafe construction or renovation work practices, and the availability of inspections for such practices.",
