  "Summary": "The bill would require  the Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) to include in its annual report an analysis of employee response rates to the city’s efforts to collect racial demographic information of city employees, and whether changes in the racial and ethnic classification categories have had an impact on employee response rates. Further, DCAS would be required to review the racial and ethnic classification categories used to collect demographic information and provide recommendations for how to improve the use of such categories to reflect the City’s workforce.",
