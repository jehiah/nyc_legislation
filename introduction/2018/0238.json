  "Summary": "This bill would require the Commissioner of Transportation to establish a pilot program to install left-turn arrow traffic signals at 100 or more intersections in the City. The Commissioner would determine the particular intersections to be affected after considering relevant traffic guidelines and consulting with advocates and would be required to install the signals at a rate of 50 per year. The bill would also require the Commissioner to monitor the effects of the pilot program on the affected intersections and to post a report on the Department of Transportation’s website analyzing the status of the program.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n       \n      Section 1. Subchapter 2 of chapter 1 of title 19 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 19-175.6 to read as follows:\n      � 19-175.6 Left-turn arrow pilot program. a. The commissioner shall establish a pilot program to install dedicated left-turn arrow traffic signals at intersections of city streets as described in this section.\n      b. No later than 90 days after the effective date of the local law that added this section, the commissioner shall select no fewer than 50 intersections of city streets for the installation of dedicated left-turn arrow traffic signals that prohibit pedestrian crossing at the corresponding pedestrian crosswalk, in locations where the installation of such traffic signals is likely to improve traffic flow.\n      1. In determining the locations of such traffic signals, the commissioner, using all relevant data including information collected from the study conducted pursuant to subdivision c of section 19-182, shall prioritize (i) intersections that the department has identified as priority intersections based on the number of collisions involving road users and the severity of injuries to road users and (ii) intersections where New York city transit bus routes require buses to make left turns.\n      2. In selecting modes for dedicated left-turn arrow traffic signals and corresponding pedestrian crossing signals pursuant to this subdivision, the commissioner shall prioritize pedestrian safety.\n      3. In selecting both locations and modes for dedicated left-turn arrow traffic signals, the commissioner shall consult with groups that advocate on traffic-related issues and groups that represent employees who will be directly affected by the installation of such signals.\n      c. The commissioner shall post on the department's website the locations of all intersections at which dedicated left-turn arrow traffic signals will be installed pursuant to this section and the mode of each such signal and shall disaggregate such locations by community board district and by council district.\n      d. No later than 90 days after the effective date of the local law that added this section, the commissioner shall begin installing dedicated left-turn arrow traffic signals at the intersections selected pursuant to subdivision b of this section. The commissioner shall complete installation of all 50 signals no later than one year and 90 days after the effective date of the local law that added this section.\n      e. After installing a signal pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall monitor the intersection where it is installed for changes, including:\n      1. Changes in the number of fatalities and injuries occurring at such intersection;\n      2. Changes in traffic and congestion at such intersection; and\n      3. Other changes deemed relevant by the commissioner.\n      f. On or before February 1 of each year until the expiration of this section, the commissioner shall post on the department's website a report analyzing the status of the program. This report shall provide a detailed assessment of the program, including, as applicable:\n      1. The cost of the program and all funding sources;\n      2. Recommendations for improvements to the program;\n      3. Availability of any new technology that could be employed by the department for use in the program;\n      4. A comparison of pedestrian safety data at the intersections affected by this section and pedestrian safety data at similar intersections that do not have dedicated left-turn arrow traffic signals;\n      5. Safety data specific to (i) all intersections affected by this section that have pedestrian islands and (ii) all intersections affected by this section that are located along fixed bus routes;\n      6. An enumeration of any additional intersections in the city that might warrant inclusion in the program or any similar future program; and\n      7. Any conclusions drawn based on the monitoring undertaken pursuant to subdivision e of this section.\n      g. This section expires and is deemed repealed five years after the effective date of the local law that added this section.\n      � 2. This local law takes effect immediately and expires and is deemed repealed 5 years after its effective date.\n \nGZ/wcj\nLS #4398/Int. No. 875-2015\nJanuary 5, 2018\nLS# 1199",
