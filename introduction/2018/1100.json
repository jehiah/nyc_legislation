  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Youth and Community Development, in consultation with the Department of Education, to establish, subject to appropriation, a program of universal after school for all public school students in the city by September 1, 2019. This bill would also require a report on a plan to address the need for expanded after school programs for all New York City youth and steps the city will take to establish universal after school. It would also report on other issues related to after school capacity and participation rates.",
