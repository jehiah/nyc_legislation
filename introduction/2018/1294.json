  "Summary": "This bill would amend Local Law 102 of 2015 to require additional reporting on whether students with disabilities are provided with adaptive physical education including the number of students receiving each of these options per individual school. The bill would also require a summary of key findings in the report issued by the department of education and whether the department is in compliance with state physical education requirements.",
