  "Summary": "The purpose of the proposed bill is to find and eliminate instances of pay disparity within the city workforce. Pay disparity can be based on gender, race, age, or any other protected class enumerated in the City’s Human Rights Law.  The Administration, through the Mayor’s Office of Data Analytics (MODA), will be required to report on an annual basis, aggregated data from every City agency looking at gender, ethnicity and race and $2.5K, $5K and $10K pay bands to find instances of pay disparities. After receiving the data from DCAS, MODA shall issue a report to the mayor and the speaker no later than May 31st annually. This report shall aggregate data from each agency showing the frequency of full- and part-time and seasonal employees by agency, EEO-4 job group, pay band ($10K) and racial group and gender. This same report will be posted publicly on the MODA website and the Open NY website.  The Council, on an annual basis, will be given 90 day access through a computer application to employment level data for all City workers to conduct its own analysis.",
