  "Summary": "This bill requires the Department of Health and Mental Health (“DOHMH”) to review all treatment of inmates for particularly serious injuries in city jails, and report all such injuries to a number of other agencies that have the authority to investigate them. The bill would also require Department of Correction (“DOC”) to investigate all such injuries, and includes a variety of public reporting from the DOC and DOHMH. The bill also imposes parallel reporting requirements for incidents in which inmates assault Correction staff.",
