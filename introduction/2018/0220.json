  "Summary": "This bill would require the Administration for Children’s Services (ACS) to submit to the Mayor and Speaker of the Council and post on its website data related to child care enrollment and capacity, which would allow ACS to assess and track the service gaps that exist in different areas of the City. The bill would also require ACS to develop a plan to address the need for expanded child care capacity, including how to assist with the creation of additional subsidized child care slots, as well as overall child care slots, in the City. The plan must also address how to assist with the creation and maintenance of adequate subsidized and overall child care slots in areas that are experiencing significant economic transition and in higher-income areas where pockets of poverty exist. ACS would be required to submit to the Mayor and Speaker of the Council and post on its website an annual progress report, and to update the plan every four years.",
