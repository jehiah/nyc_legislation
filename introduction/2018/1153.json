  "Summary": "This bill would require the Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) to implement a penetration testing protocol for the City’s electronic systems and provide the Mayor and the Speaker with information immediately following an electronic systems security breach. This bill would also require the CISO to prepare an annual report describing the implementation of the penetration testing protocol, security breaches in the previous year, and recommendations for the improvement of existing security practices.",

The chief information security officer shall adopt a protocol relating to penetration testing of electronic systems. Such protocol shall use the penetration testing standards of national institute of standards and technology special publication 800-53, including all control enhancements, or any successor standard, for all physical electronic systems, and federal risk and authorization management program penetration test guidance version 1.0.1, or any successor standards, for all cloud systems; provided that the protocol may differ from such standards in specific instances when the chief information security officer determines, after consulting with experts in the security of electronic systems, that such differences will provide a more effective test, and that such differences are documented in such protocol. Such protocol shall be made publicly available online.\n      c. The protocol required by subdivision b shall include a standard for the testing of employees of the city as well as both internally and externally accessible electronic systems for vulnerability to social engineering exploitation.
