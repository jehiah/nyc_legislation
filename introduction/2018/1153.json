  "Summary": "This bill would require the Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) to implement a penetration testing protocol for the City’s electronic systems and provide the Mayor and the Speaker with information immediately following an electronic systems security breach. This bill would also require the CISO to prepare an annual report describing the implementation of the penetration testing protocol, security breaches in the previous year, and recommendations for the improvement of existing security practices.",

For the purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings:\n      Chief information security officer. The term \"chief information security officer\" means the head of New York city cyber command as established by executive order number 28 for the year 2017 or any other officer or administering agency designated by the mayor to perform the same functions.\n      Electronic system.

The chief information security officer shall adopt a protocol relating to penetration testing of electronic systems. Such protocol shall use the penetration testing standards of national institute of standards and technology special publication 800-53, including all control enhancements, or any successor standard, for all physical electronic systems, and federal risk and authorization management program penetration test guidance version 1.0.1, or any successor standards, for all cloud systems; provided that the protocol may differ from such standards in specific instances when the chief information security officer determines, after consulting with experts in the security of electronic systems, that such differences will provide a more effective test, and that such differences are documented in such protocol. Such protocol shall be made publicly available online.\n      c. The protocol required by subdivision b shall include a standard for the testing of employees of the city as well as both internally and externally accessible electronic systems for vulnerability to social engineering exploitation. Such standard may be adopted from federal risk and authorization management program penetration test guidance version 1.0.1 or any similar standard, provided that such standard includes provisions for recording and reporting click-through rates or similar metrics. \n      d. The chief information security officer shall develop social engineering exploitation awareness materials and shall distribute such materials to all agency employees. Such materials shall also be distributed to all agency employees upon hiring.\n      e. The standard required by subdivision c shall also establish thresholds for such metrics that, when exceeded with respect to any such systems or personnel, trigger social engineering exploitation awareness material distributions or trainings and additional testing of such systems or employees of the city. \n      f. The protocol required by subdivision b shall be implemented by the chief information security officer, or by a vendor retained for such purpose, to regularly test for security vulnerabilities in the websites or other public facing electronic systems maintained by or on behalf of the city.\n      g. The chief information security officer shall conduct an annual audit of all electronic system security practices. Such audit shall include, but not be limited to, an assessment of website security credentials, penetration vulnerabilities, and vulnerability of operating systems and firmware of electronic systems.\n      h. In the event of an electronic system security breach, the chief information security officer shall:\n      1. Immediately inform the mayor, or the mayor's designee, with a description of the date, nature and severity of the security breach, as well as a description of any data or information that may have been compromised; and\n      2.

By February 1 of each year, the chief information security officer shall submit to the speaker of the council, and make publicly available online, an electronic report that describes:\n      1. the implementation of this section;\n      2. the number of penetration vulnerabilities identified through testing performed pursuant to this section since the prior report, both citywide and by agency;\n      3. the number and scope of social engineering exploitation tests conducted, both citywide and by agency; \n      4. the percentage of such social engineering exploitation tests for which the established metric did not meet the trigger threshold established pursuant to subdivision e, both citywide and by agency;\n      5. the percentage of additional social engineering exploitation tests conducted pursuant to subdivision e, both citywide and by agency, for which the established metric did not meet the trigger threshold established pursuant to subdivision e;\n      6. a description of any social engineering exploitation awareness material distributions or trainings conducted, both citywide and by agency; \n      7. a description of the date, nature and severity of any resolved electronic system security breaches in the preceding year, as well as any information or data that may have been compromised; and\n      8. recommendations for improvement in city practices and protocols for the security of electronic systems including, but not limited to, recommendations based on the findings of the audit conducted pursuant to subdivision g.\n      � 3.
