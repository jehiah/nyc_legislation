  "Summary": "The bill would require the Department of Transportation (DOT) to conduct a study on the safety of pedestrians and bicyclists along bus routes. Based on the study, the DOT would institute measures to decrease incidents involving buses and pedestrians or bicyclists along such routes, including allowing left turns to be made only on a green left arrow signal indication and other restrictions on left turns, use of curb extensions, lane narrowing and/or removal, leading pedestrian intervals, and traffic calming devices. DOT would post online and submit to the Council the study—which must include the locations of such measures and if DOT declined to implement measures, the reasons why—to the Council no later than May 1, 2019.",
