The proposed bill would require the Department of Education (DOE) to distribute to students information regarding any existing online portal operated by DOE through which students or their parents may report bullying, harassment, intimidation or discrimination. DYCD would also provide information regarding DOE’s portal to youth participating in its programs.",
