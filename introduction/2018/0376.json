  "Summary": "The proposed bill would require the Department of Youth and Community Development (DYCD) to conduct outreach informing as many youth as practicable about the availability of bullying awareness and prevention resources, including those that provide counseling, mental health resources, mobile texting or internet chat functionality and referrals. Outreach would include disseminating resource materials through existing DYCD programs and posting information on DYCD’s website and on any other agency websites as determined by the mayor. The proposed bill would require the Department of Education (DOE) to distribute to students information regarding any existing online portal operated by DOE through which students or their parents may report bullying, harassment, intimidation or discrimination. DYCD would also provide information regarding DOE’s portal to youth participating in its programs.",
