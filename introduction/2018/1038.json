  "Summary": "This local law would increase the threshold for when an income-producing property is required to provide a certified statement of income and expense in order to receive an assessment reduction by the Tax Commission from an assessed value of $1 million to an assessed value of $5 million. The local law would also index the threshold to changes in the aggregate assessed value of all properties in tax classes two and four.",

Subdivision b of section 11-216 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\n      b. 1. No reduction shall be granted for an income-producing property unless there is submitted to the tax commission a statement of income and expenses in the form prescribed by the tax commission and which shall be, in the case of property [valued at one million dollars] with an assessed value of $5,000,000 or more, certified by a certified public accountant.
