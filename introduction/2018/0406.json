  "Summary": "Muni-meter parking receipts must be displayed on a vehicle’s dashboard, requiring motorcycle operators to purchase clear plastic devices that attach to the motorcycle to hold and display the receipt. \r\n\r\nUnder the bill, the New York City Department of Transportation (DOT) would be required to ensure that muni-meter receipts have an adhesive backing so that they may be affixed to a motorcycle or similar vehicle without an enclosed dashboard.",
