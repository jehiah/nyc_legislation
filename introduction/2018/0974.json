  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Chapter 5 of title 20 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new subchapter 20 to read as follows:\nSUBCHAPTER 20\nEMPLOYMENT ADVERTISEMENTS\n      � 20-830 Employment advertisements. a.

The term \"employment advertisement\" means any public solicitation, in print or electronic format, for applications for paid work in the city of New York.\n      Mandatory arbitration clause. The term \"mandatory arbitration clause\" means a contract clause that requires the settlement of some or all disputes through arbitration.\n      Non-disparagement clause. The term \"non-disparagement clause\" means a contract clause that restricts signatories from speaking in ways that damage a person's reputation.\n      b. Disclosure of mandatory arbitration clauses and non-disparagement clauses. Persons in the city of New York shall, in employment advertisements for which the employment will be subject to a contract that includes a mandatory arbitration clause or non-disparagement clause, clearly and plainly disclose in such advertisement that the employment will be subject to a contract with such a clause or clauses.\n      c.
