  "Summary": "This bill would gradually expand the number of permits to vend food on the streets and sidewalks of New York City. A number of new permits, now referred to as supervisory licenses, would be issued in batches each year beginning in 2022 until 2032. The new supervisory licenses require at least one supervisory licensee to be present at a pushcart at all times. This new requirement will not be applied to existing permits until 2032, at which time a supervisory licensee must be present at any cart to operate. The bill will also create a new dedicated vending law enforcement unit, which would exclusively enforce vending laws. It would focus on areas of the City with known vending enforcement challenges, but will respond to vending complaints and violations throughout the City. The bill would also create a street vendor advisory board, to assess the effectiveness of the enforcement unit and the roll-out of new permits, and examine and make recommendations pertaining to vending laws.",
