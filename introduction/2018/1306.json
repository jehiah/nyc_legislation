  "Summary": "This bill would allow persons receiving temporary housing assistance from the Department of Homeless Services, and who are subject to an Independent Living Plan (ILP), to meet to discuss or revise their ILP with Department or shelter staff via telephone.  ILPs set forth strategies for meeting an individual’s or family’s housing-related public assistance and care needs, and for obtaining permanent housing.  Pursuant to state regulations, such plans must be reviewed biweekly. This bill would give individuals flexibility to meet remotely without need to take time off from work or school.",
