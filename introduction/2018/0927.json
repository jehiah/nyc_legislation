  "Summary": "This bill would require the Police Department to create a centralized electronic tracking system for all city-issued parking permits. The system would record all summonses issued in relation to the improper use of the parking permits, and would allow the Police Department to verify in real time the validity of the permits. The Department of Transportation and the Department of Education would be required to provide information to the Police Department about parking permits that those departments issue. Finally, the Police Department would be required to issue monthly reports to agencies whose employees have parking permits about any summonses received by those employees for misuse of their parking permits.",
