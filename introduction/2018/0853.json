  "Summary": "This bill would establish a working group to study the feasibility of providing childcare for the children of City employees. The working group would include experts in the field of childcare as well as representatives from City agencies, as well as representatives appointed by the City Council and the Public Advocate. The working group would issue a feasibility study report within 12 months, to be followed by a one-year pilot project for a childcare center or centers. The working group would issue a report on its findings at the conclusion of the pilot, and may make such other recommendations, as it deems appropriate, until it is sunset after five years.",

Within 12 months after this local law takes effect, the agency or city official designated in accordance with this subdivision a of this section shall submit to the mayor and the speaker the childcare working group's feasibility study report including the findings and recommendations of the childcare working group.  \n      e. Within 24 months of the submission of the feasibility study report issued in accordance with subdivision c of this section, an agency designated by the mayor shall implement a one-year pilot project to provide or subsidize a childcare center or centers for children identified in subdivision a of this section.
