  "Text": "Int. No. 770\n\nBy Council Members Menchaca, Chin, Rosenthal, Vallone and Rivera\n\n..Title\nA Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to reducing noise caused by sightseeing helicopters that meet federal noise reduction standards\n..Body \n \nBe it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      Section 1. Legislative findings and intent. The Council finds that there is significant noise pollution caused by the dozens of sightseeing helicopters operating daily from heliports owned by the city. The heliports used by sightseeing helicopters are near water which carries the sound of those helicopters and significantly disrupts the daily lives of city residents who live and work near the heliports or across the East River. A previous local law limited sightseeing tour operators to the stage 3 noise levels as determined by the federal aviation administration, however the Council finds that no current noise reduction measures will be acceptable to ensure the quiet repose of the affected communities. Therefore the Council finds that the prohibition on sightseeing helicopters needs to be extended to include helicopters that meet the stage 3 noise levels as well. \n      � 2. Subdivision a of section 24-244.1 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by proposed introduction number 859-2015, is amended by adding a new definition of \"stage 3 noise level\" in alphabetical order to read as follows:\n      Stage 3 noise level. The term \"stage 3 noise level\" means stage 3 noise level as such term is defined by subsection (h) of section 36.1 of title 14 of the code of federal regulations. \n      � 3. Subdivision b of section 24-244.1 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by proposed introduction number 859-2015, is amended to read as follows: \n      b. Sightseeing helicopters. No person shall use or permit the use of any sightseeing helicopter that meets stage 1 noise levels, [or] stage 2 noise levels or stage 3 noise levels to take off or land from any property owned or managed by the city of New York, except in emergency situations or as otherwise directed by an aviation control tower or air traffic control center.\n      � 4. This local law takes effect 270 days after it becomes law, provided that it is approved by the United States secretary of transportation pursuant to the federal airport noise and capacity act of 1990.\n\n\nARP\nLS 1976/Int. 0858-2015\nLS 993\n1/4/2018 1:25 PM\n2",
