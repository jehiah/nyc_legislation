  "Summary": "This bill would prohibit sightseeing helicopters from taking off and landing at heliports owned by the city if those helicopters meet the stage 3 noise limits for helicopters as determined by the Federal Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990, subject to approval by the United States Secretary of Transportation.",
  "TextID": 62146,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      Section 1. Legislative findings and intent. The Council finds that there is significant noise pollution caused by the dozens of sightseeing helicopters operating daily from heliports owned by the city. The heliports used by sightseeing helicopters are near water which carries the sound of those helicopters and significantly disrupts the daily lives of city residents who live and work near the heliports or across the East River. A previous local law limited sightseeing tour operators to the stage 3 noise levels as determined by the federal aviation administration, however the Council finds that no current noise reduction measures will be acceptable to ensure the quiet repose of the affected communities. Therefore the Council finds that the prohibition on sightseeing helicopters needs to be extended to include helicopters that meet the stage 3 noise levels as well. \n      � 2. Subdivision a of section 24-244.1 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by proposed introduction number 859-2015, is amended by adding a new definition of \"stage 3 noise level\" in alphabetical order to read as follows:\n      Stage 3 noise level. The term \"stage 3 noise level\" means stage 3 noise level as such term is defined by subsection (h) of section 36.1 of title 14 of the code of federal regulations. \n      � 3.
