The amendments provide a buffer to help keep security points free from crowds and other obstructions, and allow them to maintain clear sightlines.  The current prohibited zone now extends to the southerly side of Barclay Street, and includes: 1) the easterly and westerly side of Greenwich Street between Liberty Street and Thames Street; 2) the easterly side of West Broadway between Barclay Street and Park Place; 3) the northerly and southerly side of Liberty Street from Trinity Place to West Street; 4) the easterly side of West Street between Liberty Street and Cedar Street; and 5) the westerly side of Trinity Place between Liberty Street and Cedar Street.   Street vendors may still vend on the easterly and westerly sides of Broadway between Barclay Street and Vesey Street. Additionally, they may also vend on the easterly side of West St between Barclay St and Vesey St and on the southerly side of Barclay St between Church St and Broadway.","TextID":63940,"Text":"Int.
