The Commissioner of the Department, after evaluating all of these locations, may determine to stop further installation (consistent with the Commissioner’s right to decline to install a device if they determine that doing so would endanger the safety of motorists or pedestrians, or would be noncompliant with the Department’s traffic control device guidelines), but only upon informing the Speaker of the City Council of the reasons for their determination. Any senior center or NORC created after such a determination must be evaluated for placement of a traffic calming device. The Department is further required to report to the Council by September 1, 2018 and annually thereafter on the locations where traffic calming devices have been installed.","TextID":61699,"Text":"Int.
