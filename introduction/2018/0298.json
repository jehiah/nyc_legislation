  "Summary": "The proposed local law would create a new nontransferable taxicab license to allow current taxicab owners to operate one additional vehicle under a single existing medallion license. Presumably, under this proposal, the medallion owners would have an additional stream of revenues, and thus, theoretically, make taxi medallions a more attractive investment.",

Chapter 5 of title 19 of the administrative code of the city of New York is\n amended by adding a new section 19-548 to read as follows:\n      � 19-548 Nontransferable taxicab licenses. a.
