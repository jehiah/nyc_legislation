  "Summary": "The proposed local law amends Section 24-168 (d) of the Administrative Code of the City of New York, which permits the use of No. 4 oil in buildings until 2030.  The amendment mandates the gradual phase out of the use of No. 4 oil by January 1, 2025.  The phase out commences with the buildings that can switch to natural gas use immediately, followed by the buildings that need to clean out their fuel tanks and finally addresses the buildings that need to excavate their fuel tanks and possibly undertake remediation before replacing them.",
