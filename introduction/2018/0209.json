  "Summary": "This bill would require that the City permit any person operating a vehicle when snowfall has caused the department of sanitation to suspend its street sweeping operations to be permitted to drive in bus lanes. This will enhance safety and provide clarity about the risk of receiving a violation or summons solely for driving in restricted lanes when road lines are difficult to see.",
