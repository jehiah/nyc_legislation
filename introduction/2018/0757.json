  "Summary": "The New York City School Construction Authority (SCA), through its real estate division, is responsible for finding adequate sites for new school construction and buildings that may be leased for school use.  The division employs several real estate firms to locate available land and buildings. This bill would require the mayor to create an interagency task force on school siting to identify potential city-owned properties for school siting and identify vacant lots that may be good candidates for school siting. The task force would author a report for the Mayor, Council, DOE and SCA, and provide updates as necessary.",
