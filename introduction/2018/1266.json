  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation to create a pilot program for the operation of shared electric scooters in New York City. The bill would require that the Department of Transportation issue a solicitation for such pilot by October 15, 2020, and that shared electric scooter organizations be allowed to offer shared electric scooters to the public by March 1, 2021. This bill would provide that neighborhoods unserved by existing bike share programs should be given priority in determining the geographic boundaries of the pilot program. Organizations participating in the pilot would be required to implement protocols for keeping clear paths of travel and provide accessible scooter options. The bill would also require that the Department of Transportation report to the Council on the progress of the program and would prohibit the operation of shared electric scooters without prior Department of Transportation approval.",
