  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation to create a pilot program for the operation of shared electric scooters in New York City. The bill would require that the Department of Transportation issue a solicitation for such pilot by October 15, 2020, and that shared electric scooter organizations be allowed to offer shared electric scooters to the public by March 1, 2021. This bill would provide that neighborhoods unserved by existing bike share programs should be given priority in determining the geographic boundaries of the pilot program. Organizations participating in the pilot would be required to implement protocols for keeping clear paths of travel and provide accessible scooter options. The bill would also require that the Department of Transportation report to the Council on the progress of the program and would prohibit the operation of shared electric scooters without prior Department of Transportation approval.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Shared electric scooter pilot program. a. Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings: \n      Electric scooter. The term \"electric scooter\" has the same meaning as provided in section 114-e of the vehicle and traffic law or any successor provision. \n      Shared electric scooter organizations. The term \"shared electric scooter organization\" means a natural person, organization or entity that operates a fleet of shared electric scooters available for rent to the public on a short-term basis.\n      Shared electric scooter system. The term \"shared electric scooter system\" means a network of self-service and publicly available electric scooters and related infrastructure.\n      b. Pilot program. The department of transportation shall establish a shared electric scooter pilot program that allows shared electric scooter organizations, determined by the department, to operate shared electric scooter systems. The department will issue a solicitation for such pilot no later than October 15, 2020. As part of such pilot program, the department shall determine a shared electric scooter organization or organizations to offer shared electric scooter systems to the public by March 1, 2021. Such pilot shall be of a scope and scale suitable for evaluating the efficacy of shared electric scooter systems. The department shall determine the standards and geographic boundaries of such pilot program, with priority given to neighborhoods currently unserved by existing dock-based bike share programs. Shared electric scooter organizations shall provide any information requested by the department relating to their participation in such pilot program. Any shared electric scooter organizations participating in such pilot program shall be required to have in place and implement a protocol to keep paths of travel, curb ramps, and other accessibility features unobstructed for people with disabilities. Such shared electric scooter organizations shall work with the department, other relevant organizations and city agencies, and members of the disability community to ensure that accessible electric scooter options are available for use by people with disabilities as part of the pilot program.\n      c. Duration of pilot program. The shared electric scooter pilot program described in subdivision b of this section shall exist for a duration of no less than one year and no more than two years, unless the department of transportation terminates or suspends the program on an earlier date; provided, however, the department shall notify the speaker of the council in writing of such termination or suspension within seven days of taking such action and the reasons for such action.\n      d. No shared electric scooter organization shall operate any electric scooter in the city without the prior written approval of the department of transportation. If any shared electric scooter is parked or operated on a public street without such approval, it may be impounded and shall not be released until any and all removal charges and storage fees have been paid or a bond has been posted in an amount satisfactory to the commissioner of the agency that impounded such electric scooter. Such agency shall notify the owner of such impounded electric scooter, if known, of such impoundment and the method for claiming the electric scooter. Any such electric scooter not claimed may be disposed of in accordance with applicable law relating to the disposal of abandoned property.\n      e. Report. Prior to the completion of such pilot, the department of transportation shall submit a report to the speaker of the council regarding the progress of the pilot program. Such report shall include, but need not be limited to, a determination as to whether the department recommends the implementation of a permanent shared electric scooter program, along with any recommendations as to changes in the laws, rules, regulations and policies governing the use of such electric scooters, where appropriate.\n      ï¿½ 2. This local law takes effect immediately. \n\n\n\nEL\nLS #8751\n6/25/20 10:51 AM\n      1\n      \n      \n      6",
