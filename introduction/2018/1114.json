  "Summary": "This bill would create a task force to study and issue recommendations regarding monuments, statues, public art, and historical markers on city-owned property, placing special emphasis on those that have been subject to sustained negative attention or may be viewed as inconsistent with the values of diversity, equity and inclusion. The task force would be chaired by the Commissioner of Cultural Affairs or the Executive Director of the Art Commission. The Commissioners of City Planning, Parks and Recreation, and Transportation would have seats on the task force, as well as the Executive Director of the Landmarks Preservation Commission. The remaining five members of the task force would be representatives from each of the five boroughs respectively and have expertise in one or more of the following areas: history, art and antiquities, public art and public space, preservation, cultural heritage, diversity and inclusion, or education.",
