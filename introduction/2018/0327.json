  "Summary": "Curb extensions prohibit parking near crosswalks at an intersection, increasing pedestrian visibility. Under the bill, the City would be required to identify intersections that pose the greatest danger to pedestrians, based upon incidence of traffic crashes involving pedestrians, and implement curb extensions prohibiting parking within 15 feet of a crosswalk in at least five such intersections in each borough per year.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Subchapter 3 of chapter 1 of title 19 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 19-197.3 to read as follows:\n      � 19-197.3 Curb extensions. The department shall establish a curb extensions program.  As part of such program, the department shall identify intersections or parts thereof without curb extensions where such extensions may be implemented that reflect the greatest danger for pedestrians, based upon the incidence of traffic crashes involving pedestrians occurring at such intersections. Commencing in 2019, the department shall annually implement curb extensions on all or part of a minimum of five intersections in each borough identified by the department as part of such program. For the purposes of this section, \"curb extension\" shall mean an expansion of the curb line into the lane of the roadway adjacent to the curb for at least 15 feet closest to a corner or mid-block where pedestrians are permitted to cross the roadway.\n      � 2.
