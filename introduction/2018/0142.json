  "Summary": "Under current law, certain construction sites must take measures to prevent particulate matter from becoming airborne. As such, certain construction sites are required to create dust mitigation plans. This bill would clarify the types of construction materials that must be accounted for in such a dust mitigation plan. Additionally, the bill would increase the minimum civil penalty for corporations that fail to prevent particulate matter from becoming airborne.",
