  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to assess the needs of pregnant people and the availability of doulas to meet those needs. This would be done by DOHMH assessing demand, the cost of doulas, existing doula programs, current availability of doula services, and the benefits of doula programs. DOHMH would then be required to provide the Speaker of the Council with a plan for providing access to doulas to more pregnant people who request doula services as well as an annual report with information about known organizations that provide doula services or and training and information on areas in the city that experience disproportionally high rates of maternal mortality, infant mortality, and other poor birth outcomes.",
