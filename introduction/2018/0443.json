  "Summary": "A core public policy goal of the city is that tenants have the expectation to live in well-maintained buildings that are free from unsafe and hazardous living conditions. This local law would mandate that landlords, at nominal cost to themselves, conduct periodic inspections, performed by certified home inspectors, of their properties to ensure that those properties meet Housing Maintenance Code requirements. Landlords will also be required to annually certify to the department of housing preservation and development their compliance with the Code.",
