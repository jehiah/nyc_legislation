  "Summary": "“Daylighting” is a safety measure that removes parking spaces adjacent to curbs around an intersection in order to increase visibility for drivers and pedestrians. The proposed legislation would require the Department of Transportation (“DOT”) to establish a one-year pilot program implementing daylighting at a minimum of 25 intersections across the five boroughs of the City. DOT would also be required to submit to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council, and post on its website, a report regarding the pilot program, including traffic crash data for intersections that are part of the pilot program and recommendations for permanent implementation of daylighting at any intersections in the City.",
