  "Summary": "This bill would require the Mayor to include additional geographic detail about proposed new or altered city facilities in the annual Citywide Statement of Needs that is created as part of the City’s Fair Share facility siting process. In addition, the bill would require agencies to provide affected community boards and borough presidents with additional notice if a proposed city facility was not identified with sufficient detail in the Citywide Statement of Needs but the city proceeds with the siting.",
