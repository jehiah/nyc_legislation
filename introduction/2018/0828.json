  "Summary": "The Department of Records and Information Services (DORIS) is currently required to receive and post on its website all reports required by law to be published or transmitted to the Council or Mayor. This bill would require DORIS to list on its website all such reports, including relevant information such as their frequency, the law to which they are responsive and the agency or agencies primarily responsible. Such list would also provide users with access to every instance of each such report that is received by DORIS. For any report not received, DORIS would be required to request such report from the relevant agency and post such request in lieu of such report until such report is received. Finally, it would require copies of reports to be sent to DORIS electronically, rather than by paper.",
