  "Summary": "This bill would require each city agency making use of city-issued parking permits to develop a plan regarding that agency’s distribution and use of the parking permits, including criteria for distribution, an assessment of the appropriate number of permits for that agency, and proposed steps to curb unnecessary permit issuance. These agency plans would be due to an agency or office designated by the mayor by November 1, 2020. The agency or office designated by the mayor would then be required to use those agency plans to develop a comprehensive, citywide plan for the distribution and use of city-issued parking permits. This comprehensive plan would be due December 1, 2020, and would be posted online. Finally, the comprehensive plan would be reviewed at least once every five years and revised as appropriate.",
