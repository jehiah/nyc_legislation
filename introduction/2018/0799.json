For example, it would prohibit any retaliatory action by an employer if an employee requested a reasonable accommodation on the basis of a religious observance, disability, pregnancy, childbirth, medical condition, or their status as a victim of domestic violence, a sex offense or stalking, among other possible reasons.","TextID":62196,"Text":"Int.
