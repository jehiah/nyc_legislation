  "Summary": "This proposed bill would require all ocean liners and cruise ships docking at waterfront terminals equipped with shore power to use only shore power while docked. Owners of such ocean liners and cruise ships will have a grace period of two years after the bill enactment date, during which period they may continue to dock their ships at such terminals while retrofitting their ships to use shore power. By requiring all ocean liners and cruise ships to plug in to available shore power systems, this bill would reduce pollution emitted by ships that dock for hours at such terminals and protect the health of city residents.",
