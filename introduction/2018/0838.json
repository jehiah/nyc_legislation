  "Summary": "This legislation would create a new license for providing high-volume for-hire service in the City, which would only impact for-hire services that dispatch 10,000 or more trips per day. The new license would require applicants to: (i) submit a business plan, (ii) comply with any requirement of the Taxi and Limousine Commission to assess the impact of the service on the environment, (iii) provide a description of all deductions (such as commissions and lease fees) it proposes to charge for-hire vehicle owners or drivers as well as estimates of gross hourly earnings of drivers, and (iv) provide detailed trip and revenue data. \r\nThis legislation would also set a $10,000 per day penalty for operating a high-volume for-hire service without a valid TLC license to do so.",
