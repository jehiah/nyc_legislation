Chapter five of title 19 of the administrative code of the city of New York section is amended to add a new section 19-548 to read as follows: \n\t� 19-548 Reporting of assaults on commission licensed drivers. On or before December 1, 2018 and quarterly thereafter, the commission shall for the prior quarter provide a report to the council and shall post on its website the number of complaints to a city law enforcement agency alleging assault on a driver licensed by the commission, disaggregated by the type of commission license held. No information that is otherwise required to be reported pursuant to this section shall be reported in a manner that would violate any applicable provision of federal, state, or local law relating to the privacy of information or that would interfere with law enforcement investigations or otherwise conflict with the interests of law enforcement. Where necessary, the department may use preliminary data to prepare such reports and may include an acknowledgment that such preliminary data is non-final and subject to change.
