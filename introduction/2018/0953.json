  "Summary": "The proposed legislation would require property owners to correct illegally created curb cuts—breaks in a curb that allow access from the street across the sidewalk to a parking space, like a driveway. If the property owner does not correct the illegal curb cut, the Department of Transportation must do so, recovering the cost from the property owner. Additionally, community boards would be notified of any applications for permits to create a curb cut within the community district.",
