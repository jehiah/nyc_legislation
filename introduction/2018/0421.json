  "Summary": "The Administrative Code requires the Commissioner of the Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) to purchase light-duty and medium-duty vehicles that achieve the highest fuel economy. DCAS can satisfy this requirement by purchasing vehicles that run on alternative fuels. However, the definition of “alternative fuel” does not include renewable natural gas as an option.  The proposed legislation would amend the definition of alternative fuel in § 24-163.1 to include “biomethane or renewable natural gas.” The proposed legislation would further define the term “biomethane or renewable natural gas.” \r\n\r\nThe proposed legislation would also organize the definitional section to conform to modern drafting standards.",

The term \"[B]bi-fuel motor vehicle\" means a motor vehicle that is capable of being operated by both an alternative fuel and gasoline or diesel fuel, but may be operated exclusively by any one of such fuels.\n       Equivalent carbon dioxide. The term \"[E]equivalent carbon dioxide\" means the metric measure used to compare the emissions from various greenhouse gases emitted by motor vehicles based upon their global warming potential according to the California air resources board or the United States environmental protection agency.\n      Fuel economy. The term \"[F]fuel economy\" means the United States environmental protection agency city mileage published label value for a particular motor vehicle, pursuant to section 32908(b) of title 49 of the United States code.\n      Gross vehicle weight rating.

The term \"[P]purchase\" means purchase, lease, borrow, obtain by gift or otherwise acquire.\n      Use-based fuel economy. The term \"[U]use-based fuel economy\" means the total number of miles driven by all light-duty and medium-duty vehicles in the city fleet during the previous fiscal year divided by the total amount of fuel used by such vehicles during the previous fiscal year.\n      � 2.
