  "Summary": "This bill would require the city to provide the services of blood pressure testing machines for public use at no cost. Providing free, blood pressure machines for public use would enable citizens, especially un- and under-insured, at-risk individuals, to routinely monitor their blood pressures and possibly encourage them to seek medical treatment, or make life changes to lower their blood pressures in the event self-testing consistently reveals elevated levels. This law could therefore potentially save lives.",
