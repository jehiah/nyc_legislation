  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      Section 1. Chapter 1 of title 18 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 18-155 to read as follows:\n      � 18-155 Special event permits a. No less than 20 days before granting or denying an application for a permit to use park facilities under the jurisdiction of the department for the purposes of holding an event where (i) more than 500 persons are expected to attend and (ii) revenue generating activities during such event are expected to occur, the department shall provide written notification of such application by facsimile, regular mail, electronic mail or by personal delivery to the community board for each community district where such park facilities are located and shall post such application on the website of the department. Any comments provided from such community boards regarding such proposed event shall be posted on the website of the department upon the receipt of such comments.\n      b. Where more than one person applies for a permit to hold an event on the same date and in the same location on park facilities under the jurisdiction of the department, and the department determines that such facilities cannot reasonably accommodate both such proposed events at such date and time, the department, in determining which of the applicants shall be granted such permit, shall consider the application that the department first received and also consider the following factors: (i) the proposed length of time over which such proposed events may occur; (ii) the number of attendees expected to attend such proposed events; (iii) the effect that such proposed events may have on the maintenance of the park where they may occur, including any possibility of damage to parkland or facilities; (iv) whether any of the applicants have previously been granted permits for events to be held in parks under the jurisdiction of the department and whether such event was conducted in a way that was caused damage or injury to park users, parkland or park facilities; (v) whether any of the applicants have previously been granted permits for events to be held in parks and did, on that prior occasion, knowingly violate a term or condition of the permit, or any law, ordinance, statute or regulation relating to the use of the parks; and (vi) the expected cost to the department for each proposed event. \n      � 2.
