  "Summary": "This bill would require the Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) to establish a program to provide taxi and for-hire vehicle drivers with benefits, such as health care services and disability insurance. In order to fund the program, the TLC would establish a surcharge that would be added to all taxi and for-hire vehicle fares. Medallion owners and for-hire base owners would be responsible for submitting payments to the TLC. Before the program takes effect, the TLC would be required to conduct a study assessing the feasibility and cost of providing certain benefits to drivers and report its findings to the Council.",
