  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection 1. The administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new chapter 13 to title 21-A to read as follows:  \nChapter 13. Student Attrition and Backfill Data\n\t� 21-975 Student attrition and backfill data reporting.  \n\ta. For the purposes of this section the following terms shall have the following meanings:\n\tAttrition. The term \"attrition\" means the number of students discharged from enrollment between the official first day of a school year and the official last day of a school year.\n\tBackfill. The term \"backfill\" means the replacement of students who leave the school during the school year with new students.\n\tGifted and talented programs. The term \"gifted and talented programs\" means programs that are developed for and restricted to children who excel academically or in a special talent, and that are designed to provide enhanced, accelerated, enriched or extra instruction to such students, including but not limited to honors, advanced placement, college preparatory and accelerated placement classes, and programs at schools that limit admission to students with above average grades and/or who pass specialized admission tests.\n\tSpecialized school. The term \"specialized school\" means any school where admission is based on the specialized high school admission test or an audition.\n\tb. Not later than November 1, 2018, and no later than November 1st annually thereafter, the chancellor shall prepare and submit to the speaker of the council a report on student attrition and backfill data for the prior school year.

The total number to students enrolled at each school at the beginning of the prior school year; \n\t2. The attrition number and percentage for each school for the prior school year; and\n\t3. backfill number and percentage for each school for the prior school year. \n\tc. No information that is otherwise required to be reported pursuant to this section shall be reported in a manner that would violate any applicable provision of federal, state, or local law relating to the privacy of student information or that would interfere with law enforcement investigations or otherwise conflict with the interest of law enforcement. If the category contains between 0 and 9 students, or allows another category to be narrowed to be between 0 and 9 students, the number shall be replaced with a symbol. \n\t� 2. This local law takes effect immediately. \nKW/JJD\nLS 2962/Int. 613-2015\nLS 1146\n1/3/2018",
