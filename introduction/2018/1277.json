Before approving construction documents, the commissioner is authorized to examine or cause to be examined structures or premises for which an application has been filed. The department shall conduct preliminary inspections of no less than 20 percent of buildings containing six or more units where (i) an application for construction documents is submitted to the department and (ii) the applicant has indicated that the building that is the subject of such application is unoccupied, in order to verify the occupancy status of such sites. \n\n      � 2.
