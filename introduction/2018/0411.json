  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to ensure that all senior centers and social adult day cares (SADCs) that are food service establishments under Article 81 of the New York City Health Code are inspected on an annual basis.  The bill would further require DOHMH to submit an annual report to the mayor and the speaker of the council regarding the department’s activities with respect to these inspections, including a list of all senior centers and SADCs inspected (disaggregated by council district), as well as additional information.  The bill would also require the Department for the Aging to provide DOHMH with a list of all senior centers and SADCs in the city on an annual basis and to update DOHMH monthly with any changes to that list.",
