  "Summary": "This bill requires schools to conduct regular surveys and inspections for lead-based paint hazards, the results of which will be made publicly available and delivered to parents and guardians. This bill also requires HPD to, when conducting certain inspections, determine whether there has been a violation of the requirement to remediate lead hazards when a unit turns over. Finally, this bill establishes a presumption that a building owner who is unable to provide a record of having completed required lead hazard remediation at turnover has violated the relevant provisions.",

A property owner may rebut the information provided by the tenant or another source regarding the date upon which the current tenancy of such multiple dwelling unit began by submitting documents in accordance with rules of the department.

Such owner may rebut such information provided by the tenant  or another source by submitting documents in accordance with rules of the department.\n      d. The department shall issue a violation pursuant to section 27-2056.4 to any owner who fails, in response to a demand by the department and in accordance with rules of the department, to produce within 45 days of such request such records as are required to be retained by this article pertaining to compliance with the provisions of section 27-2056.4. \n      � 8. Paragraph (1) of subdivision (l) of section 27-2115 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 1 for the year 2004, is amended to read as follows:\n      (l)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when the department serves a notice of violation to correct and certify a condition that constitutes a violation of article fourteen of subchapter two of this chapter, the notice of violation shall specify date by which the violation shall be corrected, which shall be twenty-one days after the service of the notice of violation for a class C violation and thirty days after the service of the notice of violation for a class B violation, and the procedure by which the owner, for good cause shown pursuant to this subdivision, may request a postponement. The notice of violation shall further specify that the violation shall be corrected in accordance with the work practices established in accordance with section 27-2056.11 of this code. The notice of violation shall be served by personal delivery to a person in charge of the premises or to the person last registered with the department as the owner or agent, or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or by certified mail with proof of delivery, to the person in charge of the premises or to the person last registered with the department as the owner or agent; provided that where a managing agent has registered with the department, such notice of violation shall be served on the managing agent. Service of the notice of violation shall be deemed completed three days from the date of mailing. Notification, in a form to be determined by the department, of the issuance of such violation shall be sent simultaneously by regular mail to the occupant at the dwelling unit that is the subject of such notice of violation. The department may postpone the date by which a violation shall be corrected upon a showing, made within the time set for correction in the notice, that prompt action to correct the violation has been taken but that full correction cannot be completed within the time provided because of serious technical difficulties, inability to obtain necessary materials, funds or labor, inability to gain access to the dwelling unit wherein the violation exists, or such other portion of the building as may be necessary to make the required repair. Such postponement shall not exceed fourteen days from the date of correction set forth in the notice of violation. The department may require such other conditions as are deemed necessary to insure correction of the violations within the time set for the postponement. The department may grant one additional postponement of no more than fourteen days for the reasons authorized by this section so long as the paint or other condition which is the subject of the violation has been stabilized. The department is also authorized to promulgate rules establishing criteria for a postponement of the time to correct for a longer period of time where such postponement is requested because of one or more substantial capital improvements will be made that will, when completed, significantly reduce the presence of lead-based paint in such multiple dwelling or dwelling unit including, but not limited to, a requirement that the paint which is the subject of the violation is stabilized. The department shall provide to the owner and the occupant a written statement signed and dated by the person making such decision setting forth the reasons for each postponement of the date by which a violation shall be corrected or the reason for the denial of such application for a postponement. Said written statement shall be part of the records of the department. \n      � 9. This local law takes effect 1 year after it becomes law, except that the commissioner of health and mental hygiene and the commissioner of housing preservation and development may take such measures as are necessary for its implementation, including the promulgation of rules, before such date.\n\n\n\n\n\nMPC/APB\nLS 5939\n1/15/20, 9:56 PM\n1\n\n\n",
