  "Summary": "This bill would established an air quality alert response program. The Council finds that air quality in New York City has been consistently in violation of the Clean Air Act criteria air pollutants standards since those standards were put into place. During the summer months ground level ozone and particulate matter (PM) concentrations routinely rise significantly above the national standards stated in the Clean Air Act of 0.075 parts per million (ppm) causing serious health risks, especially for the most vulnerable New York City residents. \r\n\r\nTherefore, the Council finds that it is in the best interests of the City to enact a more robust program for residents of the City, to be notified of, and protected on air quality alert days.",

The creation of a notification registry that allows city residents to sign up to receive notification of air quality alerts by telephone, electronic mail or text message. Such alerts shall provide current and forecasted ozone concentrations and recommendations on whether susceptible persons should stay home or avoid exertion out of doors. These alerts shall also contain the following language: \"If you have been diagnosed with a breathing problem or a lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma you may be entitled to a reasonable accommodation from your employer, such as, where feasible, teleworking on days identified as air quality alert days by this notification system.\"; \n      2.

The department shall encourage the reduction of vehicle use by private vehicles and businesses and teleworking on air quality alert days, and shall conduct an annual survey sampling of public and private entities and, based on such survey, estimate the citywide reduction, attributable to teleworking or other measures implemented on air quality alert days, to (i) net business expenses, (ii) vehicle miles traveled, and (iii) vehicular emissions.\n      e. The department shall initiate measures designed to protect the health of susceptible persons and public health, including the health of individuals younger than sixteen years of age and older than sixty-two years of age whether or not they meet the definition of susceptible person set forth herein, in neighborhoods with the highest morbidity and mortality rates due to lung or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and other respiratory diseases.
