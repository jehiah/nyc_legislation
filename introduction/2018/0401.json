  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to ensure that full-service animal shelters are operated in all five boroughs by July 1, 2024. The current requirement is for three boroughs, with facilities to receive lost, stray or homeless dogs and cats open in any borough without a full-service animal shelter. DOHMH would be required to submit a report detailing progress toward the opening of full-service shelters in the Bronx and Queens to the Council and the Mayor on July 1, 2020, and every two years thereafter until the shelters are open and operating.",
