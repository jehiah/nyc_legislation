The current requirement is for three boroughs, with facilities to receive lost, stray or homeless dogs and cats open in any borough without a full-service animal shelter. DOHMH would be required to submit a report detailing progress toward the opening of full-service shelters in the Bronx and Queens to the Council and the Mayor on July 1, 2020, and every two years thereafter until the shelters are open and operating.","TextID":63179,"Text":"Int.
