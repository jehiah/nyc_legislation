  "Summary": "Section §14-150 of  New York’s Administrative Code, requires the New York City Police Department to provide to the Council various statistical criteria relating to the operation of the NYPD.  This bill would amend this section to require the NYPD to report on the number of voided arrests and the number of arrest which were declined by the local prosecutor, statistics that would then be disaggregated by level of crime, precinct where crime occurred, transit district and other useful categories that assist in providing the council with a more detailed understanding of police practices.",
