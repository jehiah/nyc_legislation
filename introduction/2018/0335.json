  "Summary": "This bill would require that all newsracks register with the Department of Transportation (DOT) and affix a decal with a unique identification number issued by DOT to the newsrack. As part of such registration, the owner of a newsrack would need to annually submit information regarding the newsrack, the publications to be sold, the delivery schedule of such publications, and a certificate that the newsrack complies with existing insurance requirements.",
