  "Summary": "Local law currently requires the Department of Transportation to evaluate roadways adjacent to schools with 250 or more students for the installation of speed humps. This bill would amend existing law by requiring the Department of Transportation to evaluate roadways near schools with 150 or more students. By lowering this threshold, the proposed law could lead to the installation of speed humps near smaller schools.",
