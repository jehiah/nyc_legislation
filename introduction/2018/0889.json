This seriously limits the ability to pay bail.  This bill would require the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice (MOCJ) to make reasonable efforts to work with the New York State Office of Court Administration to secure the installation of ATMs in all courthouses in New York City where arraignments take place, to ensure that the ATMs are located and accessible at convenient places and times for individuals being arraigned and to ensure that there are signs posted near the ATMs that provide a phone number to call if the ATM ceases to work.  In addition, MOCJ would be required to make an annual report on the availability of ATMs in courthouses, including their location and hours of accessibility, and MOCJ’s efforts in the prior year to secure installation of ATMs in criminal courthouses.","TextID":62893,"Text":"Int.
