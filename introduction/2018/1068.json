Section 19-551 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by a local law of the city of New York, relating to driver assistance services, as proposed in introduction number 1081-A for the year 2018, is amended by adding a new subdivision b to read as follows:\n      b. Financial education for drivers. The commission, in consultation with the department of consumer affairs and any other agencies designated by the mayor, shall engage in outreach and education efforts that are intended to inform individuals who are considering whether to enter into purchase, rental, lease or loan agreements for the purpose of obtaining vehicles for use as for-hire vehicles, and individuals who are considering whether to purchase, refinance or lease a taxicab license, about the costs and benefits of entering into such arrangements and transactions. Such outreach and education efforts may include written materials describing the common terms of such arrangements and transactions and identifying resources intended to help an individual understand the terms of such arrangements and transactions. The commission shall make any materials designed for the purposes of conducting such outreach and education available in English and in the six languages most commonly spoken by drivers, as those languages are determined by the commission, and in any other languages the commission determines to be appropriate. The commission shall make such materials available on the commission's website.\n      � 2. This local law takes effect on the same date as a local law amending the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to driver assistance services, as proposed by introduction number 1081-A for the year 2018, takes effect.\n      \nJJD\nLS 7159, 7735\n11/5/18 6:00pm\n      2\n      \n      \n      2",
