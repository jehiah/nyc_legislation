  "Summary": "Section 27-b of the New York Labor Law requires the state and its political subdivisions and instrumentalities to develop workplace violence prevention programs for the protection of public employees. That requirement does not apply to government contractors, however. This bill would require individuals and entities that provide social services directly to the public pursuant to a contract with the City to develop and implement written programs for the prevention of workplace violence. These programs would be required to include risk-assessment and training components. The bill also would establish procedures for reporting violations, would require contractors to allow participation by workers in development of the program and any inspections, and would require integration of workplace violence prevention programs with violence-prevention programs required by state law where applicable, among other requirements.",

This requirement does not apply where an imminent danger or threat exists to the safety of a specific employee or to the general health of a specific person and the employee reasonably believes in good faith that reporting to a supervisor would not result in corrective action. \n      2. If following a referral of such matter to the employee's supervisor's attention and after a reasonable opportunity to correct the violative activity, policy or practice the matter has not been resolved and the employee or representative of employees still believes that a violation of a workplace violence prevention program exists, or that an imminent danger exists, such employee or representative of employees may request an inspection by giving notice of such violation or danger to the contracting agency with which the covered contractor contracts. Each contracting agency shall designate by rule an individual responsible for receiving and handling such complaints.

Any information obtained by a contracting agency pursuant to this subdivision shall be obtained with a minimal burden on any affected covered contractor.\n      9.

Each contracting agency shall promulgate rules as necessary to implement and carry out the provisions of this section.\n      ï¿½ 2. This local law takes effect 120 days after it becomes law, except that prior to such effective date the administration for children's services, the department for the aging, the department of homeless services and the human resources administration/department of social services shall take any steps necessary for its implementation, including the promulgation of rules.\n\nWCJ/JJ\nLS 1384/Int. 0575-2014\nLS #164 12/08/2017 10:45AM\n\n      \n      7\n      \n      \n      1",
