  "Summary": "This bill would restrict food service establishments – such as restaurants, cafes, delis, bars, grocery stores and food trucks – from providing single-use plastic straws, stirrers and splash sticks to customers. Providing single-use plastic stirrers and splash sticks of any kind would be prohibited. Providing non-compostable, single-use plastic straws would be prohibited except upon request. For customers who request a non-compostable plastic straw, food service establishments would be required to provide one free of charge, without inquiring about the reason for the request. To refuse to provide a non-compostable plastic straw or to inquire about the reason for the request could constitute a violation of the City’s Human Rights Law. Food service establishments would additionally be required to stock non-compostable plastic straws to fulfill customer requests, and would have to post signs advertising the straws’ availability at self-serve stations. Compostable plastic straws would be permitted to be given out upon request only for use on-premises, and only if the food service establishment properly separates and disposes of those straws through a commercial composting provider. Food service establishments who violate the provisions of this bill would be liable for civil penalties. This bill would also repeal Chapter 4 of Title 16 of the Administrative Code pertaining to the recycling of rechargeable batteries, which is currently governed by State law.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection 1. Chapter 4 of title 16 of the administrative code of the city of New York is REPEALED and a new chapter 4 of title 16 is added to read as follows:\n      Chapter 4. SINGLE-USE ITEMS\n      � 16-401 Restrictions on providing single-use plastic beverage straws, beverage stirrers and beverage splash sticks. \n      a. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms have the following meanings:\n      Beverage splash stick. The term \"beverage splash stick\" means a device primarily intended to be used to keep heat and liquid from escaping a lidded cup.  \n      Beverage stirrer. The term \"beverage stirrer\" means a device primarily intended to be used by a person for the purpose of stirring beverages. \n      Beverage straw.

The term \"food service establishment\" means a premises or part of a premises where food is provided directly to a person, whether such food is provided free of charge or sold, and whether consumption occurs on or off the premises or is provided from a pushcart, stand or vehicle.

A sample sign that satisfies the requirements of this paragraph shall be made available in a downloadable format on the department's website. \n      d.

Food service establishments that are not covered under section 16-306.1 that provide compostable beverage straws that are made of plastic pursuant to this subdivision shall maintain distinct and clearly labeled bins indicating where such compostable beverage straws that are made from plastic are to be separated for purposes of disposal. \n      e. This section does not apply to single-use beverage straws, beverage stirrers or beverage splash sticks that are packaged in bulk by a manufacturer and offered for retail sale. This section does not apply to pre-packaged beverage straws attached to individual beverage boxes, including but not limited to juice boxes, by the beverage manufacturer.\n      f. In consultation with other city agencies, the department shall conduct outreach and education about the requirements of this section. Such outreach and education shall be offered in multiple languages and shall employ best practices for accessibility for people with disabilities.
