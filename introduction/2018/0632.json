The New York City Commission on Human Rights, in order to help employers meet this mandate, would also be responsible for creating an online interactive training module to be posted on their website for access by employers. An employee who has received anti-sexual harassment training at one employer within the required training cycle shall not be required to receive additional anti-sexual harassment training at another employer until the next cycle.","TextID":62641,"Text":"Int.
