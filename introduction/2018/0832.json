  "Summary": "Under current law, a mobile food vending permit may, at the discretion of DOHMH, be transferred to a dependent spouse, domestic partner or child and general vending licenses may not ever be transferred. This bill would provide that both mobile food vendor permits and general vendor licenses shall, as of right, be transferrable to a dependent spouse, domestic partner or child upon the death or incapacitation of the permit or license holder.",
