  "Summary": "This proposed local law would prohibit businesses operating in New York City from setting a minimum dollar value greater than $10 for the acceptance of credit cards in selling, leasing, renting or loaning consumer goods or services to the public. Businesses would be required to post notice of such prohibition on or near any fixed point of sale terminal. The Department of Consumer Affairs would be authorized to recover civil penalties for violations. The Department would also create a web form that the public could use to report a violation.",
