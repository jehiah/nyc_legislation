  "Summary": "Federal law requires sufficient vessel waste pumpout facilities for a body of water to be designated a no-discharge zone for water protection purposes. This bill would require the Department of Environmental Protection to create a plan for establishing the city’s coastal waters as vessel no-discharge zones, to install at least three pumpout facilities per year until all coastal waters in the city are designated as no-discharge zones, to report annually on progress regarding the foregoing, and to ensure that no-discharge zones maintain their status as no-discharge zones once they are established.",
