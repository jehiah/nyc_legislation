  "Summary": "Backflow devices prevent cross-connections between potable and non-potable water.  In order to carry out its responsibility pursuant to the Public Health Law, the DEP must determine if a facility poses a potential hazard to the City’s water supply. When a facility poses a hazard due to its operations, the DEP Commissioner is required to direct the installation by the owner of an approved backflow prevention device. This proposed local law will require the Department to submit an annual report to the Mayor and the Council on the number of backflow devices needed, installed, tested and the number of violations issued for failure to install a backflow device.",
