The term \"comparative classification criteria\" means, with respect to a safety registration number holder undergoing classification pursuant to this section, each of the following: \n\n1.\tThe number of violations sustained against such holder in the calendar year preceding classification, excluding violations that have been dismissed, divided by the number of jobs undertaken by such holder during such year.\n\n2.\tThe number of immediately hazardous violations sustained against such holder in the calendar year preceding classification, excluding violations that have been dismissed, divided by the number of jobs undertaken by such holder during such year.\n\n3.\tThe number of stop work orders issued against such holder for an immediately hazardous violation in the preceding calendar year divided by the number of jobs undertaken by such holder during such year.\n\n4.\tThe current experience modification rate calculated by the New York compensation insurance rating board for such holder.\n\nPERSON IN CONTROL.

A method for evaluating such holder's implementation of such system, including documented self-inspections that occur at least weekly and involve employees of such holder.\n\n4.2. Weekly or more frequent meetings or discussions among the employees of such holder, and any contractor or subcontractor of such holder, concerning safety issues encountered by such holder.\n\n4.3.

A safety registration number holder who is not classified into any other tier shall be classified as a tier two safety registration number holder.\n\n� 28-420.5.2.4 Tier three. If a safety registration number holder satisfies item 1, 2, 3 or 4 of this section, and is not classified in tier four or five, such holder shall be classified as a tier three safety registration number holder:\n\n1.\tIn the preceding six-month period, there has been one or more fatal accidents resulting in violations sustained against such holder.\n\n2.\tTwo or more comparative classification criteria for such holder are at or above the ninety-fourth percentile for such holder's class determined under section 28-420.5.1, provided that if the number of violations sustained against such holder in the preceding calendar year, excluding violations that have been dismissed, is fewer than three, then the comparative classification criterion described by paragraph 1 of the definition of \"comparative classification criterion\" shall be deemed to be below the ninety-fourth percentile for such holder's class determined under section 28-420.5.1.\n\n3.\tSuch holder satisfies each of the following conditions:\n\n3.1.

A remediation plan shall be developed and completed for a tier four safety registration number holder as follows:\n\n1. \tWithin ten business days after notice has been provided by the commissioner under section 28-420.5.3 to safety registration number holder stating that such holder has been classified in tier four, such holder shall contact the department, in a manner to be determined by department rule, to arrange a remediation plan meeting with the department.\n\n2.\tAt such meeting, the department and such holder shall develop a remediation plan which shall include (i) physical precautions, procedural changes, training and similar initiatives to address such holder's safety and violation issues and (ii) steps that the department and such holder shall take to monitor such holder's remediation plan progress, (iii) a timeframe for implementation of such plan and (iv) such other measures as the department may require.\n\n3.\tSuch holder shall not be eligible for classification above tier four until the department determines that such holder has successfully completed such plan.\n\n4.\tThe department may by rule establish fees for development and monitoring of remediation plans.\n\n� 28-420.5.2.6 Tier five. A safety registration number holder who does not meet with the department to develop a remediation plan as required by section 28-420.5.2.5.1 or who does not comply with such plan shall be immediately classified as a tier five safety registration holder. \n\n� 28-420.5.2.6.1 Suspension of safety registration number. The safety registration number of a tier five safety registration number holder shall be suspended in accordance with this section:\n\n1.\tIf a safety registration holder is classified in tier five because such holder did not contact the department, in the manner determined by such department, to arrange a remediation plan meeting under section 28-420.5.2.5.1, the commissioner shall, after providing such holder with an opportunity to be heard and in accordance with procedures the commissioner shall establish by rule, suspend the safety registration number of such holder until such a remediation plan meeting is held and thereafter until such holder demonstrates satisfactory compliance with such plan. \n\n2.\tIf a tier five safety registration number holder has not met with the department to develop such a remediation plan within two months after provision of the notice described in item 1 of section 28-420.5.2.5.1 and the department has offered at least two dates for such meeting, the commissioner shall, after providing such holder with an opportunity to be heard and in accordance with procedures the commissioner shall establish by rule, suspend the safety registration number of such holder until such meeting is held and thereafter until such holder demonstrates satisfactory compliance with such plan.\n\n3.\tIf a tier five safety registration number holder fails to comply with a remediation plan required by section 28-420.5.2.1.5, the commissioner may, after providing an opportunity for a tier five safety registration number holder to be heard and in accordance with procedures the commissioner shall establish by rule, suspend the safety registration number of such holder until such holder demonstrates satisfactory compliance with such plan.\n\n� 28-420.5.2.6.2 Revoking or refusing to renew a safety registration number. Whenever a tier five safety registration number holder satisfies a condition for suspension described in section 28-420.5.2.6.1, the commissioner may, in lieu of suspending the safety registration number of such holder, revoke or refuse to renew the safety registration number of such holder, after providing such holder with an opportunity to be heard and in accordance with procedures the commissioner shall establish by rule.\n\n� 28-420.5.3 Notice. Within 10 business days after classifying a safety registration number holder in accordance with sections 28-420.5.2.1 and 28-420.5.2.2, the commissioner shall provide notice to such holder, in a form and manner to be determined by the commissioner. Such notice shall include, at a minimum, such holder's classification under sections 28-420.5.2.1 and 28-420.5.2.2, the meaning of such classifications, a description of the process by which such classifications were made, and a description of how such process was applied to such holder in making such classifications.
