A single person occupying a dwelling unit and maintaining a common household with not more than [two] four boarders, roomers or lodgers; or \n\n2. Two or more persons related by blood, adoption, legal guardianship, marriage or domestic partnership; occupying a dwelling unit and maintaining a common household with not more than [two] four boarders, roomers or lodgers; or \n\n3. Not more than three unrelated persons occupying a dwelling unit and maintaining a common household; or \n\n4. Not more than three unrelated persons occupying a dwelling unit in a congregate housing or shared living arrangement and maintaining a common household; or \n\n5. Members of a group home; or \n\n6. Foster children placed in accordance with provisions of the New York State Social Services Law, their foster parent(s), and other persons related to the foster parents by blood, marriage or domestic partnership; where all residents occupy and maintain a common household with not more than two boarders, roomers or lodgers; or \n\n7. Up to seven unrelated students enrolled at a single accredited college or university occupying a student apartment and maintaining a common household pursuant to a lease, sublease, or occupancy agreement directly with such college or university, provided that: \n\n7.1.

Such occupancy does not exceed the maximums contained in Section 27-2075(a) of the New York City Housing Maintenance Code; and \n\n7.3.
