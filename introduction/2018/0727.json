  "Summary": "In light of multiple accidents involving sightseeing buses that occurred in recent years, this bill expands licensing requirements for sight-seeing bus companies. Sightseeing bus drivers must meet basic requirements, such as not having accumulated nine or more points on their driving record within an 18 month period, not having their licenses suspended or revoked, and not being convicted of an alcohol or drug-related offence over the past three years.  Sightseeing bus companies must maintain driving records for each of their drivers and make them available for inspection by the Department of Consumer Affairs. Additionally, the company must notify the Department of Consumer Affairs if any of their drivers is involved in a motor accident or are charged with an alcohol or drug-related offence. The company must also register New York licensed drivers in the Department of Motor Vehicles License Event Notification System.",

Section 20-372 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new subdivision 11 to read as follows:\n\t11. \"Sight-seeing bus driver\" shall mean any natural person who operates a sight-seeing bus in the city of New York.\n\t� 2. Subdivision a of section 20-376 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\n\tA vehicle shall be licensed as a sight-seeing bus only after it shall have been examined and inspected to determine that it complies with this section, and that it also (1) complies with all the requirements of the vehicle and traffic law of the state of New York, and (2) is certified by the department of transportation of the state, as being safe and properly equipped to operate, or if the department of transportation of the state determines an inspection by that department is not required, is certified by the department of motor vehicles of the state.\n      � 3. Subchapter 21 of chapter 2 of title 20 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 20-376.2 to read as follows:\n\t� 20-376.2 Sight-seeing bus drivers. a. It shall be unlawful for an owner of a sight-seeing bus company to employ any person as a sight-seeing bus driver unless that person:\n      1.

An owner of a sight-seeing bus company shall inform the commissioner as soon as practicable if any driver employed by the sight-seeing bus company is charged with any alcohol or drug-related offense pursuant to article 31 of the vehicle and traffic law or any similar offense under the laws of any other jurisdiction or any criminal offense involving the operation of a motor vehicle.
