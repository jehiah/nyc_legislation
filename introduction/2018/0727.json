Sightseeing bus drivers must meet basic requirements, such as not having accumulated nine or more points on their driving record within an 18 month period, not having their licenses suspended or revoked, and not being convicted of an alcohol or drug-related offence over the past three years.  Sightseeing bus companies must maintain driving records for each of their drivers and make them available for inspection by the Department of Consumer Affairs. Additionally, the company must notify the Department of Consumer Affairs if any of their drivers is involved in a motor accident or are charged with an alcohol or drug-related offence. The company must also register New York licensed drivers in the Department of Motor Vehicles License Event Notification System.","TextID":63572,"Text":"Int.
