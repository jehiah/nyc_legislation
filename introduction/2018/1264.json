The bill would allow for the use of electric bicycles incapable of exceeding 25 miles per hour. The bill would also clarify that operators of electric bicycles allowed by local law are subject to State and local laws applicable to bicycle operators as well any additional provisions applicable to electric bicycle operators.","TextID":68778,"Text":"Int.
