  "Summary": "This bill would require the New York City Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) to develop a climate survey to be administered on a voluntary basis at all city agencies to ascertain the general awareness and knowledge of the city’s equal employment opportunity (“EEO”) policy, including but not limited to sexual harassment policies and prevention. The survey will be followed by a report to the mayor and speaker with the results.
