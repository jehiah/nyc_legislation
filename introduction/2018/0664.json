The survey will be followed by a report to the mayor and speaker with the results. Based on these results DCAS shall work with each city agency to develop an action plan to address the results of the surveys to be incorporated into each agency’s annual EEO plan according to the following schedule:\r\n•\tClimate survey distribution: September 31, 2018\r\n•\tReport on first survey: February 28, 2019\r\n•\tDevelopment of action plan: December 31, 2019\r\n•\tReport on Action Plan: March 31, 2020\r\n•\t2nd survey distribution: July 31, 2020\r\n•\tReport on second survey: December 31, 2021\r\n•\t2nd action plan development and report: December 31, 2022\r\n\r\nOn or before July 31, 2024 and on or before July 31 every four years thereafter, the survey will continued to be administered to all city employees.",
