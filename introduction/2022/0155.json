  "Summary": "This bill would require the Commissioner of Buildings to waive the filing fee for a permit to alter a one-, two- or three-family home when the dwelling has been damaged by fire for work to repair damage from the fire and any construction defects discovered following the fire. The fee waiver would extend to other dwellings in the same homeowner’s association or cooperative association to correct the same construction defect. The bill would also require the Department of Buildings to conduct outreach on the waiver in the designated citywide languages.",
