  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to create and maintain information and resources – available in all designated citywide languages – for a potential patient of an abortion provider, such as information outlining methods used to provide an abortion, attendant health risks, and recovery from an abortion. Additionally, this bill would require DOHMH to conduct a language access service needs assessment, which would survey abortion providers in the City to assess the availability of language access services for abortion, the demand for such services, any funding available, preferred methods of delivery of language access, and any challenges for implementation. DOHMH would report its findings to the Speaker and the Mayor with recommendations and any role the City can play in assisting abortion providers with language access services, including the feasibility of providing a City grant program.",
