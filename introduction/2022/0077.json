  "Summary": "Tenant screening lists, sometimes called “tenant blacklists,” are used to identify supposedly risky renters by naming tenants who have been involved in a Housing Court case. This bill would mirror recent state law changes by prohibiting landlords from considering refusing to rent to prospective tenants solely because they appear on a tenant screening list. The bill adds participating in a housing court proceeding to the list of protected classes in the housing accommodations section of the civil rights title of the Administrative Code.",
