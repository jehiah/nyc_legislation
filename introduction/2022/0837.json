The [fast food] employee knew or should have known of the [fast food] employer's policy, rule, [or] practice or performance standard that is the basis for progressive discipline or discharge;\n      2. The [fast food] employer provided relevant and adequate training to the [fast food] employee;\n      3.

The [fast food] employee violated the policy, rule or practice, failed to meet the performance standard or committed the misconduct that is the basis for progressive discipline or discharge.\n      c. Except where termination is for an egregious failure by the employee to perform their duties, or for egregious misconduct, a termination shall not be considered based on just cause unless (1) the [fast food] employer has utilized progressive discipline; provided, however, that the [fast food] employer may not rely on discipline issued more than one year before the purported just cause termination, and (2) the [fast food] employer had a written policy on progressive discipline in effect at the workplace or job site [fast food establishment] and that was provided to the [fast food] employee.\n      d. 1.

If the employer is relying on data collected through electronic monitoring to make the discharge decision, the employer shall also provide any aggregated data collected on employees performing the same or similar functions at the same establishment for the six months prior to the discharge in question. \n      3. In determining whether an [a fast food] employer had just cause for discharge, the fact-finder may not consider any reasons proffered by the [fast food] employer but not included in such written explanation provided to the [fast food] employee. \n      4. Where an employer fails to timely provide a written explanation to an employee, the discharge shall not be deemed to be based on just cause.\n      e.

Employers who have established practical necessity for using data from electronic monitoring for tracking and assessing employee performance may not rely solely on such data but must also use other means of assessment such as manager observation or interviewing clients, customers or other employees to solicit feedback.\n      b. Notwithstanding subdivision a, employers may use data gathered through electronic monitoring:\n      1.  To record the beginning or end of a work shift, meal break, or rest break; \n      2.

Employers may not discipline or discharge an employee based on failure to meet a daily quota if the employee did not complete their entire shift.\n      e. 1. Notwithstanding subdivision a, employers using electronic monitoring to measure increments of time within a day during which an employee is or is not meeting performance standards  may not record or rely on such data in discharging or disciplining an employee unless it is gathered during a periodic performance review and so long as the employee subject to the performance review has been given at least seven days advance notice of the exact timing of such review. \n      2. Such reviews can occur not more than once a quarter and can occur for a duration of time not longer than 3 hours. \n      f.

Whether the data gathered through electronic monitoring will be used to make or inform disciplinary or discharge decisions, and if so, the nature of that decision, including any associated benchmarks or performance standards;\n      2. Whether the data gathered through electronic monitoring will be used to assess employees' productivity performance or to set productivity standards, and if so, how;\n      3.

A notice that states electronic monitoring \"may\" take place or that the employer \"reserves the right\" to monitor shall not be considered clear and conspicuous. \n      2. An employer who engages in periodic electronic monitoring of employees for the purposes of discipline or discharge shall inform the affected employees of the specific events which are being monitored at the time the monitoring takes place. \n      3. Notice of periodic electronic monitoring may be given after electronic monitoring has occurred only if necessary to preserve the integrity of an investigation of illegal activity or protect the immediate safety of employees, customers or the public. \n      5. An employer shall provide additional notice to employees when an update or change is made to the electronic monitoring or in how the employer is using it.\n      h. Employers shall provide a copy of the disclosures required by this section to the department at the time they are required to be disseminated to employees.\n      � 20-1272.2 Data access and accuracy. a. An employer shall ensure that any data collected through electronic monitoring that may be used for the purposes of discipline or discharge is accurate and, where relevant, kept up to date.\n      b. A current employee shall have the right to request a copy of employee work speed data that may be used for the purposes of discipline and termination at least once every seven days. \n      c. 1. Employers using electronic monitoring to collect employee work speed data for the purposes of discipline or discharge must provide employees the opportunity to supplement that data to record any increments of time during which they are not performing work-related tasks and to record the reason that they are not performing work-related tasks during that time. \n      2. Such opportunity must be made available to employees both at the time of data collection and after. \n      3. Employers must give employees the option to record reasons for not performing tasks that include, at a minimum, the following: using the bathroom, taking meal breaks, responding to an emergency, injury, illness, fear of injury, disability, complying with local, state or federal laws or exercising workplace rights under local, state or federal laws. \n      d. 1. Employers using electronic monitoring to collect employee work speed data for the purposes of discipline or discharge must provide employees with the opportunity to review and request correction of such data both at the time of its collection and after.\n      2. An employer that receives an employee request to correct inaccurate data that collected through electronic monitoring shall investigate and determine whether such data is inaccurate. \n      3. If an employer, upon investigation, determines that such data is inaccurate, the employer shall:\n      (a) Promptly correct the inaccurate data and inform the employee of the employer's decision and action.\n       (b) Review and adjust, as appropriate, any disciplinary or discharge decisions that were partially or solely based on the inaccurate data and inform the employee of the adjustment.\n      (c) Inform any third parties with which the employer shared the inaccurate data, or from which the employer received the inaccurate data, and direct them to correct it, and provide the employee with a copy of such action.\n       4. If an employer, upon investigation, determines that the data is accurate, the employer shall inform the employee of the following:\n       (a) The decision not to amend the data.\n       (b) The steps taken to verify the accuracy of the data and the evidence supporting the decision not to amend the data.\n      � 20-1273 Arbitration. a.  On or after January 1, 2022, any person or organization representing persons alleging a violation of this subchapter by an [a fast food] employer may bring an arbitration proceeding.  In addition, the department may, to the extent permitted by any applicable law including the civil practice law and rules, provide by rule for persons bringing such a proceeding to serve as a representative party on behalf of all members of a class. Such a proceeding must be brought within 2 years of the date of the alleged violation.  If the arbitrator finds that the [fast food] employer violated the provisions of this subchapter, it shall (i) require the [fast food] employer to pay the reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of the [fast food] employee, (ii) require the [fast food] employer to reinstate or restore the hours of the fast food employee, unless the employee waives reinstatement, (iii) require the [fast food] employer to pay the city for the costs of the arbitration proceeding, and (iv) award all other appropriate equitable relief, which may include back pay, rescission of discipline, in addition to other relief, and such other compensatory damages or injunctive relief as may be appropriate.\n      b. A person or organization bringing an arbitration proceeding under subdivision a must serve the arbitration demand, and any amendments thereto, on the [fast food] employer either in person or via certified mail at the current or most recent [fast food establishment] workplace or job site where each [fast food] employee named in the arbitration demand is or was employed, or pursuant to the rules for service specified in article 3 of the civil practice law and rules. Such arbitration demand must include a general description of each alleged violation but need not reference the precise section alleged to have been violated.\n      c. The parties to an arbitration proceeding shall jointly select the arbitrator from a panel of arbitrators. The number of arbitrators on the panel shall be determined by the department. The arbitrators on the panel shall be chosen by a committee of eight participants established by the department and comprised of:\n      1. Four employee-side representatives, including [fast food] employees or advocates; and\n      2. Four employer-side representatives, including [fast food] employers or advocates.\n      d.

If the committee established pursuant to subdivision c of this section is unable to select a sufficient number of arbitrators for the panel as determined by the department, the department shall select the remaining arbitrators.\n      f. If the parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, the department shall select an arbitrator from the panel.\n      g. The department shall provide interpretation services to any party requiring such services for the arbitration hearing.\n      h. The arbitration hearing shall be held at a location designated by the department or a location agreed to by the parties and the arbitrator. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, such arbitration shall be subject to the labor arbitration rules established by the American Arbitration Association and the rules promulgated by the department to implement this subchapter. In case of a conflict between the rules of the American Arbitration Association and the rules of the department, the rules of the department shall govern. Any rules promulgated by the department implementing this section shall be consistent with the requirement that in any arbitration conducted pursuant to this section, the arbitrator shall have appropriate qualifications and maintain personal objectivity, and each party shall have the right to present its case, which shall include the right to be in attendance during any presentation made by the other party and the opportunity to rebut or refute such presentation.  \n      i. If an [a fast food] employee brings an arbitration proceeding, arbitration shall be the exclusive remedy for the wrongful discharge dispute and there shall be no right to bring or continue a private cause of action or administrative complaint under this subchapter, unless such arbitration proceeding has been withdrawn or dismissed without prejudice.\n      j. Each party shall have the right to apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the confirmation, modification or vacatur of an award pursuant to article 75 of the civil practice law and rules, as such article applies, pursuant to applicable case law, to review of legally mandated arbitration proceedings in accordance with standards of due process.\n      � 20-1274 Applicability of schedule change premiums. A discharged fast food employee who loses a shift on a work schedule as a result of discharge, including employees whose employment is terminated for any reason, shall be entitled to schedule change premiums for each such lost shift pursuant to section 20-1222.\t\n      � 20-1275 Exceptions.

Statute of limitations. A civil action under this section shall be commenced within two years of the date the person knew or should have known of the alleged violation.\n      e.   Relationship to department action. \n      1.   Except where the action seeks the imposition of civil penalties, any [Any] person filing a civil action shall simultaneously serve notice of such action and a copy of the complaint upon the department. Failure to so serve a notice does not adversely affect any plaintiff's cause of action.\n      2.   An employee need not file a complaint with the department pursuant to subdivision b of section 20-1207 before bringing a civil action; however, no person shall file a civil action after filing a complaint with the department unless such complaint has been withdrawn or dismissed without prejudice to further action.\n      3.   No person shall file a complaint with the department after filing a civil action unless such action has been withdrawn or dismissed without prejudice to further action.\n      4.   The commencement or pendency of a civil action by an employee does not preclude the department from investigating the employer or commencing, prosecuting or settling a case against the employer based on some or all of the same violations.\n      5. Notwithstanding the foregoing subdivisions, the comptroller or any current or former employer may initiate a public enforcement action seeking to recover civil penalties and injunctive and declaratory relief as a relator on behalf of the department for a violation affecting current or former employees by giving written notice to the department, in such manner as the department may prescribe by rule, of the provisions of this title alleged to have been violated, including the facts and theories to support the alleged violation. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, where a current or former employee is represented by a bona fide labor organization, no organization other than such labor organization may initiate a public enforcement action in relation to any violation by which they were affected. Within 65 calendar days of the postmark date of the notice, the department shall notify the relator if it intends to open an investigation. Within 60 calendar days of that decision, the department may investigate the alleged violation and take any enforcement action authorized by law. If the department determines that additional time is necessary to complete the investigation, it may extend the time by not more than 60 additional calendar days and shall notify the relator of the extension. If the department determines that no enforcement action will be taken, does not respond to the notice, or if no enforcement action is taken by the department within the time limits prescribed, a public enforcement action for civil penalties may be commenced in court. The department may intervene in a public enforcement action for civil penalties brought under this subdivision and proceed with any and all claims in the action as of right within thirty days after the filing of the public enforcement action, or for good cause, as determined by the court, at any time after the thirty-day period after the filing of the public enforcement action. \n      f. Any civil penalties imposed as a result of an enforcement action described in paragraph 5 of this subdivision shall be distributed 65 percent to the department, and 35 percent to the relator to be distributed to the employees affected by the violation, except that if the department intervenes in the action, 75 percent of the penalties shall be distributed to the department and 25 percent to the relator, including a service award that reflects the burdens and risks assumed by the relator in prosecuting the action. The share of penalties recovered for the department under this subsection shall budgeted into a separate account. Such account shall be used solely to support the department's worker protection education and enforcement activities, with 25 percent of these penalties reserved for grants to designated community groups for outreach and education about rights under the city's labor standards. \n      g. The right to bring an action as a relator under this section shall not be contravened by any private agreement. If any part of an employee relator's claim under this part is ordered or submitted to arbitration, or is resolved by way of final judgment, settlement or arbitration in favor of the employee, the employee relator retains standing to maintain an action for violations suffered by other employees in any forum having jurisdiction over the claim.\n      � 5. This local law takes effect 180 days after it becomes law, except that the commissioner of the department of consumer and worker protection shall take such measures as are necessary for the implementation of this local law, including the promulgation of rules, before such effective date.\n      \n2",

Notwithstanding the foregoing subdivisions, the comptroller or any current or former employer may initiate a public enforcement action seeking to recover civil penalties and injunctive and declaratory relief as a relator on behalf of the department for a violation affecting current or former employees by giving written notice to the department, in such manner as the department may prescribe by rule, of the provisions of this title alleged to have been violated, including the facts and theories to support the alleged violation. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, where a current or former employee is represented by a bona fide labor organization, no organization other than such labor organization may initiate a public enforcement action in relation to any violation by which they were affected. Within 65 calendar days of the postmark date of the notice, the department shall notify the relator if it intends to open an investigation. Within 60 calendar days of that decision, the department may investigate the alleged violation and take any enforcement action authorized by law. If the department determines that additional time is necessary to complete the investigation, it may extend the time by not more than 60 additional calendar days and shall notify the relator of the extension. If the department determines that no enforcement action will be taken, does not respond to the notice, or if no enforcement action is taken by the department within the time limits prescribed, a public enforcement action for civil penalties may be commenced in court. The department may intervene in a public enforcement action for civil penalties brought under this subdivision and proceed with any and all claims in the action as of right within thirty days after the filing of the public enforcement action, or for good cause, as determined by the court, at any time after the thirty-day period after the filing of the public enforcement action. \\par\nf.

The share of penalties recovered for the department under this subsection shall budgeted into a separate account. Such account shall be used solely to support the department\\rquote s worker protection education and enforcement activities, with 25 percent of these penalties reserved for grants to designated community groups for outreach and education about rights under the city\\rquote s labor standards. \\par\ng. The right to bring an action as a relator under this section shall not be contravened by any private agreement. If any part of an employee relator\\rquote s claim under this part is ordered or submitted to arbitration, or is resolved by way of final judgment, settlement or arbitration in favor of the employee, the employee relator retains standing to maintain an action for violations suffered by other employees in any forum having jurisdiction over the claim.\\ulnone\\par\n\\'a7 5. This local law takes effect 180 days after it becomes law, except that the commissioner of the department of consumer and worker protection shall take such measures as are necessary for the implementation of this local law, including the promulgation of rules, before such effective date.\\par\n\\par\n}\n",
