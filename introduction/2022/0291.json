It would also require DOT and DPR to annually report to the Mayor, Speaker and public on the implementation and updating of this plan. Additionally, this bill would require DOT and DPR to regularly engage with community boards that contain locations potentially suitable for greenway development. DOT or DPR would have to provide notice of and an opportunity to request a presentation on future greenway development proposals to affected community boards.",
