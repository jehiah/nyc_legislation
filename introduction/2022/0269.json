  "Summary": "This bill would require that if an organization or individual requests a permit for an athletic field or court for a fifth consecutive year then the Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR) shall conduct an assessment of the use of such permit by such organization or individual to determine whether they have engaged in any activity (i.e., violating DPR rules) that would preclude the issuance of permits to such applicants in the future.",

The commissioner shall conduct an assessment of any applicant who has applied for any permit for the use of an athletic field or court under the jurisdiction of the commissioner for a fifth consecutive year after having been issued a permit for the previous four consecutive years to determine whether such applicant has conducted any action that may preclude such applicant from being issued a new permit.
