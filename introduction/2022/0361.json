  "Summary": "The bill would authorize the temporary use of outdoor portable gas-fueled heating devices for healthcare facilities. Currently, the Fire Code limits such portable devices to be those fueled by piped natural gas. This bill would expand the scope of authorized equipment to include portable heating devices fueled by liquefied petroleum gas, also known as propane. The authorized use would be limited to the duration of the mayoral state of emergency declared as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
