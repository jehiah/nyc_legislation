  "Summary": "This bill would require chain restaurants with 15 or more locations to conspicuously post added sugar icons and factual warning statements on menus or menu boards next to menu items and on or near food items on display that exceed a specified level of added sugars as determined by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration or another amount specified by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH). This bill would consider food items that are identical to prepackaged food items to have the same density of added sugars as displayed on the nutrition facts of the prepackaged food item, unless demonstrated otherwise. This bill would also require such restaurants to conspicuously post an added sugar icon on or near any non-packaged food items on display or on menus or menu boards no later than 1 year after the federal regulations that require restaurants to include added sugars in nutritional information of non-packaged food items go into effect. Any covered restaurant that violates the provisions of this bill would be liable for a civil penalty of $200.",
