Under this proposal, the Department of Sanitation, the Department of Transportation and the Department of Parks and Recreation would each be required to develop and maintain a web-based application for the purpose of tracking its progress in relation to the cleaning and maintenance of the city properties under the agency’s jurisdiction.",
