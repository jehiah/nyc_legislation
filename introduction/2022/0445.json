  "Summary": "This local law would require the Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR) to create five-year capital plans for all parks on a community board by community board basis. The five-year capital plan for each community board would list all parks within the community board and detail any planned capital projects at each park. DPR would be required to submit the proposed five-year capital plan to the community board, which would be required to hold a public hearing and submit recommendations on the plan back to DPR. DPR would then create a final five-year capital plan that would be submitted to the Mayor, the Council, and the community board and posted online. DPR would be required to submit any amendments to the final five-year plan to the same parties each year.",
