The term \"street homeless\" means an individual who (i) is living on the street or in a place not meant for human habitation or (ii) is receiving services from the department of homeless services or the human resources administration because such individual is currently or was formerly living on the street or in a place not meant for human habitation.\n      Rental assistance program.
