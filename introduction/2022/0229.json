  "Summary": "This bill would prohibit the department of social services from deducting a utility allowance from the maximum rental allowance of a rental assistance voucher. The bill would also require the department, in situations where the actual rent of a household receiving a rental assistance voucher is less than the maximum rental allowance for that household, to reduce the tenant’s contribution by the difference between the maximum rental allowance and the actual rent, up to the amount of the utility allowance. If such a reduction is greater than the household rent contribution, the department would be required to issue a check to the household in the amount of such excess, within the month in which such excess is accrued. Further, this bill provides that if a household receives a shelter allowance that is reduced by accepting an apartment that is less than the maximum rental allowance, the department shall issue a check to the household in the amount of such a reduction within the month in which such reduction is accrued.",
