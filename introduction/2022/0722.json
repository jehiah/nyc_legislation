Specifically, the Department would be required to report on: (a) each fire, occurring the prior calendar year, where powered mobility devices were determined to be the suspected cause; (b) a review of fire risks posed by powered mobility devices and any design or use limitations to mitigate such risks; (c) a review of existing Fire Code provisions, and an evaluation of additional local regulatory measures, that mitigate fire risks posed by powered mobility devices; (d) an examination of regulatory approaches taken in other jurisdictions to mitigate fire risks posed by powered mobility devices; and (e) a summary of all activities taken by the fire department to decrease the occurrence of fires caused by powered mobility devices. The Fire Department would be required to submit to such reports to City Council, one due on January 30, 2023 and an update due on January 30, 2024.",
