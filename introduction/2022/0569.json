  "Summary": "This bill would require the Office of Labor Standards (OLS) within the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, in coordination with the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs and the New York City Commission on Human Rights, to create and publish an immigrant workers’ bill of rights, which would contain information on the rights and protections under federal, state and local laws that apply to all workers in the City, regardless of immigration status. Employers would be required to post the immigrant workers’ bill of rights in a conspicuous location in the workplace, and to provide the immigrant workers’ bill of rights to employees upon hiring. Employers whose business operates online or through a mobile application would also be required to post the immigrant workers’ bill of rights online or on such mobile application. OLS would be required to conduct outreach to employers and employees in the City to raise awareness about the immigrant workers’ bill of rights.",
