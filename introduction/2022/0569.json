  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP), in coordination with the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs (MOIA), the New York City Commission on Human Rights, and community and labor organizations, to create and publish a workers’ bill of rights, which would contain information on the rights and protections under federal, state, and local laws that apply to all workers in the City, regardless of immigration status. Employers would be required to post the workers’ bill of rights in a conspicuous location in the workplace, and to provide a copy to employees upon hiring. Employers whose business operates online or through a mobile application would also be required to post the workers’ bill of rights online or on such mobile application. MOIA, in coordination with DCWP and community and labor groups, would be required to conduct outreach to workers in the City to raise awareness of the workers’ bill of rights. Such outreach would also include contact information for the City’s Immigration Legal Hotline and Asylum Application Help Center, resources and contact information for immigration legal services and MOIA, information on what to expect if immigration enforcement authorities come to an individual’s workplace, and information regarding federal eligibility requirements of Temporary Protected Status following designations, extensions, and re-designations of such status.",
