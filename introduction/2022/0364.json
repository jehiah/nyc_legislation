  "Summary": "Under the HireNYC program, certain development projects that receive financial assistance from the New York City Economic Development Corporation or the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development must enroll in HireNYC to connect qualified City residents to entry and mid-level construction-related job openings generated by such development projects. The proposed legislation would supplement HireNYC by requiring covered developers to post a sign at the premises of the development project informing individuals who are interested in applying for construction job openings related to such development project that they may contact an SBS workforce career center, along with the location and contact information of the nearest SBS workforce career center.",
