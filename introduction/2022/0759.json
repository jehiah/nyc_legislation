  "Summary": "This bill would require the Police Department to establish a program to provide the public with etchings that affix or engrave identifying numbers into catalytic converters of vehicles for the purpose of assisting law enforcement investigations and deterring theft of such parts, and provides misdemeanor penalties for removing or tampering with identification numbers etched into a catalytic converter that one does not own.  Additionally, the bill creates a local misdemeanor offense of “Unlawful possession or sale of catalytic converters,” which prohibits possession or sale of five or more second-hand catalytic converters or three or more second-hand catalytic converters that demonstrate indicia of having been being unlawfully removed from a vehicle.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      Section 1. Chapter 1 of title 10 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding new sections 10-185 and 10-186 to read as follows:\n      � 10-185 Catalytic converter etching program. a.

Engage in an outreach campaign to inform the public about the etching program and the means by which etching may prevent theft of catalytic converters.\n      c. Prohibited conduct. No person shall remove, obliterate, or tamper with a unique identifying number etched onto a catalytic converter that such person does not own.
