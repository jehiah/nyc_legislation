  "Summary": "This bill would require that any dealer in second-hand articles, or anyone else purchasing a catalytic converter for commercial purposes, must first obtain from the seller information about the vehicle the catalytic converter was removed from, which shows that the seller either owns the vehicle or was otherwise authorized to remove the catalytic converter in connection with a repair. In addition, the purchaser would be required to determine if the catalytic converter presented is consistent with one removed from the identified vehicle. The purchaser would be required to retain records of this information for at least five years. A violation of these requirements would be grounds for the suspension or revocation of any license issued by a city agency.",
