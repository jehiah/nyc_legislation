  "Summary": "This bill would require the Office of Operations (OPS), the Office of Cyber Command (NYC3) and the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DOITT) to establish a program for city agencies to provide Wi-Fi to the public. OPS, NYC3 and DOITT would be required to submit a report identifying the city agencies that are able to provide public access to existing secure wireless networks being used by such agencies. City agencies identified in the report would be required to submit a plan to OPS, NYC3 and DOITT to provide public access to secure wireless networks. Subsequently, such city agencies would be required to implement such plans to provide public access to Wi-Fi, and set up a publicly accessible space for individuals to access such Wi-Fi. Finally, the bill disclaims any liability on the part of the City for any damages incurred though the use of Wi-Fi provided pursuant to this bill.",
