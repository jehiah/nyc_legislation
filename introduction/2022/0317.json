  "Summary": "This local law would require every City agency that manages capital projects to submit a monthly report to the Mayor, or an office or agency designated by the Mayor, which would detail all construction work scheduled in the ensuing three months and provide a status update on all construction work that had been scheduled during the prior six months. The Mayor, or office or agency designated by the Mayor, would be required to compile the reports of the managing agencies into a citywide which would be reviewed to promote coordination between managing agencies and to ensure that work on capital projects is being scheduled and conducted in an efficient and effective manner. The citywide report would be submitted to the Council, gas and electrical utility companies in the City, and the Empire City Subway Company, as well as be posted on the City’s website, in a machine-readable format.",
