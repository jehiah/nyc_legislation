  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) to identify 150 class A multiple dwellings per borough based on factors including number of temperature violations and heat-related complaints every two years. Such identified buildings would then be required to install internet-capable temperature reporting devices for up to four years. HPD would be required to conduct dedicated heat inspections of these buildings at least once every two weeks, and tenants would be able to opt in to providing automatic heat data transmission to HPD.",
