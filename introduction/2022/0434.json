  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) to identify 50 class A multiple dwellings per year based on factors including number of temperature violations and heat-related complaints. Such identified buildings would then be required to install internet-capable temperature reporting devices for up to four years, and owners would be required to transmit heat data to HPD once every 30 days for the duration of heat season. HPD would be required to conduct dedicated heat inspections of these buildings at least once every two weeks.",
