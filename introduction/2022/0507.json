  "Summary": "This bill would require DOHMH to provide mifepristone and misoprostol at no cost to the patient in its health centers, health stations, health clinics or other health facilities which also offer services relating to sexual and reproductive health. DOHMH would provide such mifepristone and misoprostol to patients who seek to terminate their pregnancy, when, according to the provider’s reasonable and good faith professional judgment based on the facts of the patient’s case, the patient is within 11 weeks from commencement of pregnancy, and the patient has provided informed consent. DOHMH would also provide counseling and timely referrals to other health facilities and qualified family planning providers, if needed, for other services.",
