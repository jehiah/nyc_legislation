  "Summary": "This bill would prohibit discrimination in employment, public accommodations and housing based on having a tattoo. It would create an exception in employment and apprentice training programs where covering a tattoo is a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to carrying out a job function, and there exists no less discriminatory means of satisfying the qualification. It would also create exceptions in employment and housing where the City Human Rights Commission grants an exception based on considerations of public policy. In addition, this bill would clarify that a religious observance in employment includes having a tattoo.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      Section 1. Section 8-101 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 58 for the year 2020, is amended to read as follows: \n      � 8-101 Policy.\n      In the city of New York, with its great cosmopolitan population, there is no greater danger to the health, morals, safety and welfare of the city and its inhabitants than the existence of groups prejudiced against one another and antagonistic to each other because of their actual or perceived differences, including those based on race, color, creed, age, national origin, immigration or citizenship status, gender, sexual orientation, disability, marital status, partnership status, caregiver status, sexual and reproductive health decisions, uniformed service, any lawful source of income, whether a person has a tattoo, status as a victim of domestic violence or status as a victim of sex offenses or stalking, whether children are, may be or would be residing with a person or conviction or arrest record. The council hereby finds and declares that prejudice, intolerance, bigotry, and discrimination, bias-related violence or harassment and disorder occasioned thereby threaten the rights and proper privileges of its inhabitants and menace the institutions and foundation of a free democratic state. The council further finds and declares that gender-based harassment threatens the terms, conditions and privileges of employment. A city agency is hereby created with power to eliminate and prevent discrimination from playing any role in actions relating to employment, public accommodations, and housing and other real estate, and to take other actions against prejudice, intolerance, bigotry, discrimination, sexual harassment and bias-related violence or harassment as herein provided; and the commission established hereunder is hereby given general jurisdiction and power for such purposes.\n      � 2.
