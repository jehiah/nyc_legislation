  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation (DOT) to report on motor vehicles with license plates that are unreadable by red light cameras or school speed cameras. An unreadable license plate would be defined as a license plate that a photo-violation monitoring system does not read because the camera malfunctioned, the license plate’s number was concealed or obscured, the license plate produced a distorted recorded or photographic image, or if no license plate was affixed to the motor vehicle. This bill would require DOT to post the report on its website and submit those reports to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council each quarter. The report would include information on the days and times of day when the license plates could not be read, the community districts where they could not be read, and the reason the license plate could not be read.",
