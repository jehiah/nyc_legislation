  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation (DOT) to report on evasion of red light cameras or school speed cameras by motor vehicles with unreadable license plates. An unreadable license plate would be defined as a license plate that a photo-violation monitoring system does not read because the camera malfunctioned, the license plate’s number is concealed or obscured or the license plate produces a distorted recorded or photographic image. This bill would require DOT to post the report on its website each month and submit those reports to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council as a single report by January 31 of each year.",
