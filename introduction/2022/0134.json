  "Summary": "This bill would revise Local Law 32 for 2022, the salary disclosure law, to clarify that the law applies to employees who are paid hourly or through an annual salary. The law would not apply to positions that can not or will not be performed in New York City. A person would not be able to bring a lawsuit against an employer based on this law unless that individual is a current employee who is bringing an action against their employer for advertising a job, promotion or transfer without posting a minimum and maximum hourly wage or annual salary. This bill would also clarify that the penalty for the first violation of this law would be $0 and employers would have 30 days to correct the violation. This bill would also move the effective date of Local Law 32 of 2022 to November 1, 2022.",
