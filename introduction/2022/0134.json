  "Summary": "This bill would revise Local Law 32 for 2022, the salary disclosure law, to exclude employers with fewer than fifteen employees. It would also clarify that the law applies to employees who are paid hourly or through a salary. The law would not apply to notices that an employer is hiring without specifying the position and to positions that are not required to be performed in New York City. This bill would also move the effective date of Local Law 32 of 2022 to November 1, 2022.",
