  "Summary": "The proposed bill would add a right to file a private civil action to the Earned Sick Time Act (ESTA), which allows most private employees in New York City to earn paid sick time from their employers. Under the current law, employees who are denied their rights under the ESTA are limited to filing a complaint with the Department of Consumer Affairs. This bill would allow such employees to also file a case with any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce their rights.",
