  "Summary": "This bill would allow employees who are alleging a violation of their rights under the Earned Safe and Sick Time Act (ESSTA) to commence a civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction. Filing a complaint with the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) for the same alleged violation would be neither a prerequisite nor a bar to bringing a civil action. Employees alleging a violation of their rights under ESSTA will have two years of the date they knew or should have known of the alleged violation to commence a civil action or file a complaint with DCWP.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n      \n      Section 1. Section 20-924 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 97 for the year 2020, is amended to read as follows:\n      � 20-924 Enforcement and penalties. a. The department shall enforce the provisions of this chapter. In effectuating such enforcement, the department shall establish a system utilizing multiple means of communication to receive complaints regarding non-compliance with this chapter and investigate complaints received by the department in a timely manner. The department may open an investigation upon receipt of a complaint or on its own initiative. \n      b. Any person alleging a violation of this chapter shall have the right to file a complaint with the department within [two] 2 years of the date the person knew or should have known of the alleged violation. The department shall maintain confidential the identity of any natural person providing information relevant to enforcement of this chapter unless disclosure of such person's identity is necessary to the department for resolution of its investigation or otherwise required by federal or state law. The department shall, to the extent practicable, notify such person that the department will be disclosing [his or her] such person's identity prior to such disclosure. \n      c. 1. Upon receiving a complaint alleging a violation of this chapter, the department shall investigate such complaint, provided that if the complainant commences a civil action pursuant to subdivision f of this section for the same alleged violation, the department shall stay such investigation until the department is notified such civil action is withdrawn or dismissed without prejudice. Upon notice of a final judgment or settlement in such a civil action, the department shall dismiss the complaint unless the department determines the complaint alleges a violation not resolved by such judgment or settlement. The complainant must notify the department, in a manner prescribed by the commissioner and described on the department's website, within 30 days of the date that the time for any appeal has lapsed that such complaint is withdrawn, dismissed without prejudice, or resolved by final judgment or settlement. Nothing in this paragraph shall affect the authority of the department to open an investigation on its own initiative pursuant to subdivision a of this section. \n      2. Within [fourteen] 14 days of written notification of an investigation by the department, the person or entity under investigation shall provide the department with a written response and such other information as the department may request.
