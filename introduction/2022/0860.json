  "Summary": "This bill would codify the definition of a “traffic study” and the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) process of approving or denying a traffic study request. This bill would require DOT to perform a requested traffic study, if one had not been performed within 18 months. If a traffic study was performed within 18 months, DOT may deny the request but only if the traffic conditions remain materially the same. If a traffic study is denied, upon request, DOT would be required to provide a written statement stating that traffic conditions are the same, and provide a copy of previous traffic studies and their summaries within 2 weeks of the request being made.",
