  "Summary": "The proposed legislation would require the Fire Department, in consultation with the Department of Citywide Administrative Services, to develop and implement a plan regarding the recruitment and retention of individuals from populations that are underrepresented within the rank of firefighter. In doing so, the Department must: (i) identify and remediate obstacles faced in recruitment, examination, training, hiring and retention of individuals from populations underrepresented within the rank of firefighter, including consideration of racial and gender equity; (ii) recommend recruitment plans that encourage individuals from populations underrepresented within the rank of firefighter to apply to become a firefighter; and (iii) providing support for the recruitment and retention of individuals from populations that are underrepresented within the rank of firefighter. The Fire Department would also be required to post an annual report on its website that includes an overview of its recruitment and retention efforts, including reference to all related budgetary expenditures for such efforts, and the projected change in the percentage of firefighters from populations that are underrepresented within the rank of firefighter.",
