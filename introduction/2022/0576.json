  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR), to inspect and issue a report on each public restroom under its jurisdiction that has routinely been given an unacceptable rating after having been inspected by DPR. DPR would also be required to maintain a website that would include information about the location of each restroom and the condition and functionality of features in each public restroom (i.e., the cleanliness and the conditions of fixtures like sinks and toilets in such restrooms), as determined by DPR inspections.",
