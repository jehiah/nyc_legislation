  "Summary": "The bill would require HPD to reach out to owners of multiple dwellings for which HPD has received complaints about conditions in unoccupied dwelling units that may be the cause of a hazardous or immediately hazardous condition in an occupied dwelling unit. The owner would be required to schedule an HPD inspection of such dwelling unit within 21 days. HPD would conduct an inspection of the unoccupied unit, guided by an inspection checklist, and issue violations for hazardous or immediately hazardous conditions. The bill would also allow lawful occupants of the building to apply for an order directing that HPD be provided access to the premises when necessary to correct violating conditions.",
