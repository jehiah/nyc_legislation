  "Summary": "This bill would require certain stores that sell food for off-premises consumption, such as grocery stores, to post notices on the food donation web portal regarding excess food they have available for donation, at least once per month. Stores would also be required to arrange for the retrieval of the food that they are donating and to arrange for the transportation of such food if requested by the recipient. The bill provides an exemption for stores that have agreements in place for the donation of food on at least a monthly basis. By December 1 of each year, the Department of Sanitation or other city entity designated by the Mayor, would be required to submit to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council a report detailing the results of a yearly review of available food on the web portal and whether that available food is expected to meet the demands of city residents in the coming year.",

[Within eighteen months after the effective date of the local law that added this section, t]The department or another agency or office designated by the mayor, shall, in conjunction with the department of information technology and telecommunications, create or modify and maintain a web portal that will allow prospective food donors and recipients, including but not limited to restaurants, grocery stores, produce markets, dining facilities and food rescue organizations, to post [notifications] notices concerning the availability of food, including food that would otherwise go to waste, and to arrange for the transportation or retrieval of such food. Such portal shall, at a minimum, allow (i) a prospective food donor to describe the type and amount of food available, including any information necessary to keep the food safe for human consumption, such as refrigeration requirements, as well as other information necessary to facilitate its donation, (ii) a prospective food recipient to specify the type and amount of food donations it will accept and the areas of the city from which it will accept donations and to receive prompt notification concerning the availability of food satisfying such specifications, and (iii) a prospective food donor and a prospective food recipient to communicate directly through a messaging system within such portal. \n      c.
