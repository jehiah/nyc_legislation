  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation to place temporary priority regulatory signs, such as a stop sign or yield sign, at roadway intersections within an hour of a reported traffic control signal outage or malfunction. The Department of Transportation is currently required to arrive at intersections and access traffic control signals within two hours of a reported outage or malfunction, but not to implement alternative traffic control measures unless signal repair or replacement will take greater than twenty-four hours. Requiring the placement of temporary signage within an hour rather than waiting up to twenty-four hours for alternative traffic control measures could significantly reduce the risk of pedestrian injury and vehicular collisions at intersections with malfunctioning traffic control signals.",
