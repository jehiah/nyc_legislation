Every opening in a floor used for the removal of debris shall be tightly enclosed with a shaftway, extending from floor to floor, with such shaftway enclosed with:\n\n1.  Planking not less than 2 inches (51 mm) in thickness, or equivalent solid material; [or]\n\n2.  Where  the  opening  is  used  for  the  removal  of  noncombustible  material,  wire  mesh  may  be  utilized  in  lieu  of planking, provided such mesh is not less than number 18 gauge wire mesh, with openings in the wire no longer than  1/2  inch (13  mm),  and  also provided  that  the  wire  mesh  is securely  attached, in  accordance  with drawings developed by  a  registered design professional, to the shaftway so that the wire mesh enclosure in  any  location does not deflect more than 2 inches (51 mm) when a force of at least 200 pounds (890 n) is applied along any horizontal portion of such wire mesh enclosure[.]; or\n\n3.

Horizontal safety nets shall be reinstalled immediately following the end of active loading or unloading operations, or active work, or at the end of the workday, whichever occurs sooner.\n      \n      � 8.

Unenclosed perimeter protection, or portions thereof, may be temporarily removed in the immediate area where active loading or unloading operations, including debris removal, are occurring, or to the extent necessary to facilitate active work at the perimeter, including but not limited to inspections or the relocation of unenclosed perimeter protection to a higher level, provided there is compliance with the following items:\n\n\n\n\nGuardrail systems may be temporarily removed in the immediate area where active loading or unloading operations, including debris removal, are occurring, or where perimeter work is occurring, provided that:\n\n1.

A controlled access zone is established to prevent unauthorized personnel from entering the area where the unenclosed perimeter protection has been removed; \n\n3. Prior to the removal the floor is cleared of all material, equipment, and debris to a distance of at least 10 feet (3048 mm) in all directions from the area where the unenclosed perimeter protection is to be removed, except for material or equipment that is related to the active loading or unloading operation or active work at the perimeter, or that is stored in accordance with Section 3303.4.5.2;\n\n4.  Immediately prior to removal the floor is broom-swept to a distance of at least 10 feet (3048 mm) in all directions from the area where the unenclosed perimeter protection is to be removed and, in addition, areas in the immediate vicinity of the unenclosed perimeter protection are vacuumed, including areas around zero cables, toeboards, and spaces where trapped debris may have accumulated;\n\n5.  During removal operations areas are vacuumed as required by Section 3308.9.6;\n\n6. A competent person supervises the operation as required by Section 3308.10.2;\n\n7.
