  "Summary": "This bill would require the City Chief Procurement Officer to conduct a study and issue a report on the timing and duration of the City's procurement process for human services contracts exceeding the small purchase limit. The report would identify the steps in the procurement process for these contracts and evaluate the time needed to complete each step. It would provide recommendations to the Procurement Policy Board (PPB) for setting procurement timelines as required under the City Charter. The PPB would then review the report and propose rules establishing procurement timelines for human services contracts. The bill would also mandate that the Chief Procurement Officer begin issuing biannual reports starting in October 2026 on agency compliance with the time schedules set by the PPB.",
