  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Education (DOE) to issue an annual report to the Speaker, and to post such report on the DOE website, regarding District 75 programs. DOE-designated District 75 programs provide educational, vocational, and behavioral support to students with significant challenges, such as Autism Spectrum Disorders, significant cognitive delays, emotional disturbances, sensory impairments and multiple disabilities. The required report would include the number of students in each building that provides a District 75 program, as well as the criteria DOES considers to determine where to establish a District 75 program.",
