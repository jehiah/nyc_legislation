  "Summary": "This bill would establish an Office of Healthcare Accountability. This office would audit city expenditures on employee-related health care costs, and make recommendations on how to lower these costs. It would also be required to create a publicly accessible website that provides information on the costs of hospital procedures and summarizes the cost transparency of each hospital. Finally, it would also be required to, where feasible, report on the factors external to hospitals such as the operating and profit margin of major insurance providers.",
