  "Summary": "This bill would require simultaneous interpretation in the top three most common languages among the affected population for any public meeting at which more than 65 members of the public are expected to attend, along with all Council, Community Board and Borough Board public meetings. In addition, this bill would require documents for such meetings to be translated into those languages, if practicable. Finally, this bill would allow people to request in advance that the city provide simultaneous interpretation into additional languages and at smaller public meetings.",
