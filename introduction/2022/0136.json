  "Summary": "This bill would require each agency that provides direct public or emergency services to develop a vendor resource guide of community-based translators and interpreters for at least 100 languages. Those agencies would then have discretion to utilize this list in order to fill agency contracts below the small purchase limits. The bill would also require the City’s Chief Procurement Officer to issue a quarterly report to the Mayor and the Speaker on agencies’ procurements of translation and interpretation services, including their use of vendors in in the vendor resource guide.",
