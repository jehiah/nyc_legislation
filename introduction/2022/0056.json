  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to create the Nightlife Opioid Antagonist Program to help prevent opioid overdoses in nightlife establishments. The program would permit nightlife establishments in the City to request and retain up to 5 opioid antagonist kits at a time, free of charge, to keep on premises for administration to patrons, staff or individuals on the premises experiencing an opioid overdose. This bill would also require DOHMH to offer free resources and training to staff of participating nightlife establishments on the administration of opioid antagonists.",
