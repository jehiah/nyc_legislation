  "Summary": "In general, universal design for housing involves designing an apartment or house so that it is accessible for everyone, regardless of age, physical ability or stature. This bill would require the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) to develop a list of universal design principles and require that a developer who receives City financial assistance incorporate universal design in at least 10 percent of dwelling units in each housing development project or housing preservation project. It would also require HPD to produce annual reports on the universal design list and universal design unit requirement, which HPD would post on its website.",
