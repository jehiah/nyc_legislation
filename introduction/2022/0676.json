  "Summary": "In general, universal design for housing involves designing an apartment or house so that it is accessible for everyone, regardless of age, physical ability or stature. This bill would require the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) to develop a list of universal design features and require that a developer who receives City financial assistance incorporate universal design in all dwelling units in a new housing development project. It would also require HPD to produce a report on the universal design list, which HPD would post on its website.",
