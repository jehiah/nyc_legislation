  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) to create a pilot program on the use of low emission exhaust pipes. The pilot program would encompass 20 percent of all motor vehicles owned by the City that are run not exclusively by electric power, because they are already zero emission vehicles. The bill would also require DCAS to provide a written report to the Speaker of the Council and post such report on its website not later than one year following the start of the pilot program. The report would include the cost of the pilot program and the emissions reduction from the program.",
