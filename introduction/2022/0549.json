Failure to comply with any of the provisions described in paragraph 1 of this subdivision, or as established by board of correction rule, shall constitute a due process violation warranting dismissal of the matter that led to the hearing.\n      g. Pre-hearing temporary restrictive housing. In exceptional circumstances, the department may place a person in pre-hearing temporary restrictive housing prior to conducting a restrictive housing hearing as required by subdivision f of this section.  \n      1. Such placement shall only occur upon written approval of the Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner, or another equivalent member of department senior leadership over the operations of security.

The department shall provide the incarcerated person access to such available programs, treatment and services. \n      3.

Emergency lock-ins may only be used when there are no less restrictive means available to address an emergency circumstance and only as a last resort after exhausting less restrictive measures. Emergency lock-ins must be confined to as narrow an area as possible and limited number of people as possible. The department shall lift emergency lock-ins as quickly as possible. The Commissioner, a Deputy Commissioner, or another equivalent member of department senior leadership over the operations of security shall review such lock-ins at least every hour. Such lock-ins may not last more than four hours.\n      2. Throughout an emergency lock-in, the department shall conduct visual and aural observation of every person locked in every fifteen (15) minutes, shall refer any health concerns to medical or mental health staff, and shall bring any person displaying any indications of any need for medical documentation, observation, or treatment to the medical clinic.
