  "Summary": "This bill would require that City employees who can issue summons or notices of violation, when questioning people, provide a pre-printed, handwritten, or electronic business card with identifying information upon request. If a business card is not available, employees could instead provide the identifying information verbally. The business card should include the employee’s name and agency, and a telephone number and e-mail address that can be used to contact the agency. Employees who are engaged in agency approved undercover activities, who must take immediate action, or are providing identifying information through a certificate of inspection, notice of violation, or similar document are exempt from the requirements of this bill.",
