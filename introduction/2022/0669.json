The task force would report annually on the issue of illegal housing conversions and provide recommendations for related policy changes. The task force would be composed of members from multiple city agencies with functions related to illegal housing arrangements and representatives of the Council, and would hold hearings across the boroughs to assist in the creation of its reports.",
