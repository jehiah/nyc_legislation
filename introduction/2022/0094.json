The term \"school\" means a school of the city school district of the city of New York. \n      Dress code. The term \"dress code\" means any rules or policies pertaining to how students may or may not dress during the school day, including any disciplinary consequences that might result from a violation of said rules or policies. \n      Gender.

The term \"gender presentation\" means the external appearance, dress, mannerism and behavior through which each individual presents their gender identity or the gender they wish to appear as, regardless of the sex assigned to that person at birth, and includes a person whose external gender expression is not exclusively male or female.\n      b. No later than August 1, 2020, and annually thereafter, the department of education shall submit to the speaker of the council and post on its website a report on the dress code policies, if any, followed by each school.
