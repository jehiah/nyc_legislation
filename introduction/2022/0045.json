  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation to group active transportation docking stations that serve the same general area, from all providers, together in a centralized location within that area when the installation or relocation of a new docking station occurs, except where otherwise prohibited by an existing contract. The bill would define active transportation to mean all non-vehicular methods of transportation that use a wheeled device propelled by human power, and also to include electric bicycles, electric skateboards and electric scooters.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Subchapter 2 of chapter 1 of title 19 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 19-160 to read as follows:\n      � 19-160 Active transportation siting. a. Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings:\n      Active transportation. The term \"active transportation\" means all non-vehicular methods of transportation that use a wheeled device propelled by human power. Such term also includes electric bicycles, electric skateboards and electric scooters.\n      Docking station. The term \"docking station\" means an automated self-service terminal that is used for the storage of bicycles and other forms of active transportation for rent between rentals. Such term includes areas designated by the commissioner for such purposes, whether or not they contain rental instructions, equipment for the acceptance of payment or locking mechanisms.\n      b. Where the department approves the designation, installation or relocation of a docking station within the same vicinity as another docking station that has already been installed or approved for installation, the commissioner shall require that the docking station to be designated, installed or relocated be placed within one city block of such preexisting docking station. Where placing multiple docking stations for the same vicinity within the same city block as each other is impracticable, docking stations in the same vicinity shall be placed as near to each other as the commissioner determines is practicable under the circumstances.  \n      c. Nothing in this section modifies a bike share or other active transportation operator's duties and obligations pursuant to a contract with the department in effect on the effective date of the local law that added this section.\n      � 2. This local law takes effect 120 days after it becomes law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSession 12\nNAB\nLS #3575\n1/14/22\n\nSession 11\nIS \nLS #13010\n\n\n      1\n      \n      \n      2",
