  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. a. Definitions. For the purposes of this local law, the following terms have the following meanings:\n      Commissioner. The term \"commissioner\" means the commissioner of health and mental hygiene.\n      Department. The term \"department\" means the department of health and mental hygiene.\n      Doula. The term \"doula\" means: (i) a trained person who provides continuous physical, emotional, and informational support to a pregnant person and the family before, during, or shortly after childbirth, for the purpose of assisting a pregnant person through the birth experience; or (ii) a trained person who supports the family of a newborn during the first days and weeks after childbirth, providing evidence-based information, practical help, and advice to the family on newborn care, self-care and nurturing of the new family unit.\n      � 2. No later than October 1, 2022, the commissioner shall establish a pilot program for training doulas and providing professional, no-cost doula services to residents of neighborhoods in all five boroughs. The commissioner shall determine the standard used to determine which neighborhoods will be included in the pilot and the standard for how many visits each doula shall provide, provided that each program participant is provided with the option of having at least two visits with a doula. Such pilot shall include no fewer than 50 doulas. Participating doulas shall be trained on, at minimum, the practical roles and responsibilities of a doula. Such training shall be designed in consultation with community members and may include additional topics including, but not limited to, trauma-informed care, perinatal mood and anxiety disorders, respectfully navigating the hospital environment, and support services available to low-income birthing people and their families. Within such pilot program, where a birthing person presents to the department with a possible developmental, intellectual or physical disability, the department shall assess whether such person is receiving any supportive services related to the perceived disability and coordinate with the doula to ensure that appropriate services are provided. \n      � 3. Such pilot program shall continue until January 1, 2024 and may continue past that date at the discretion of the commissioner.\n      � 4. No later than October 30, 2023, the commissioner shall submit to the mayor and the speaker of the council and post online a report on such pilot program. The report shall include, but not be limited to: (i) the number of doulas trained through the pilot, disaggregated by type of doula if they identify with a subsector of the field; (ii) an overview of topics covered in such doula training; (iii) the number of individuals served by doulas involved in the pilot; (iv) a list of the zip codes that such individuals live in; (v) an evaluation of the benefits of the pilot and how such benefits were measured or evaluated; (vi) an overview of challenges or lessons learned from the pilot, and (vii) recommendations as to whether and how such pilot program should continue or be expanded.\n      � 5.
