  "Summary": "This bill would require the mayor to establish an Office of Pedestrians, either as a stand-alone office or within a city agency. The office would be led by a director whom the mayor or, if the office is within an agency, an agency head would appoint. The director’s primary responsibilities would include issuing policy recommendations and serving as an intermediary between pedestrians and city agencies, with the goal of improving pedestrian safety in the city. The director would also be required to submit an annual report detailing the office’s activities.",
