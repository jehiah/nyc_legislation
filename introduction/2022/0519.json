  "Summary": "The proposed legislation would require the Fire Department to survey each firehouse to determine the permanent facility upgrades necessary to facilitate use by a mixed gender workforce. Upon completion of the survey, the Department would be required to submit to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council, a report on the findings of the survey detailing permanent facility upgrades necessary at each firehouse, the feasibility of implementing such upgrades and any construction plans to make such upgrades.  Additionally, the Department would be required, where practicable, to implement interim measures, including but not limited to the use of physical barriers, to accommodate a mixed gender workforce until permanent upgrades are made.",
