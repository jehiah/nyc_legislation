  "Summary": "The bill would require the City to establish an alert system to notify the public of emergencies that require law enforcement at schools.",
  "TextID": 71685,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      Section 1.  Title 10 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new chapter 12 to read as follows:\nCHAPTER 12\nSCHOOL EMERGENCY ALERT\n\t� 10-1201 Definitions. As used in this chapter, the following terms have the following meanings: \n\tAdministering agency. The term \"administering agency\" means a city agency, office, department, division, bureau or institution of government, the expenses of which are paid in whole or in part from the city treasury, that the mayor designates.\n\tSchool emergency. The term \"school emergency\" means a situation involving a threat of harm to students, personnel, or facilities, including but not limited to natural, technological, and human-caused incidents, that require response from law enforcement. Such incidents include but are not limited to school shelter-ins, lockdowns, and evacuations.\n      � 10-1202 School emergency alert system. a. The administering agency shall establish a school emergency alert system, pursuant to the provisions of this section, to provide rapid notification to the public when a school emergency occurs.\n      b. The administering agency shall develop a protocol for notifying parents and legal guardians of students when a school emergency occurs.\n      c. The administering agency shall issue a school emergency alert within one hour of the determination that a school emergency occurred. The administering agency may use its discretion to refrain from issuing such an alert if the alert is inappropriate under the circumstances or would compromise a law enforcement investigation. The school emergency alert may be issued by any appropriate means, including, but not limited to, email notifications, text messages, telephone calls, television broadcasts, or radio broadcasts. The school emergency alert may be issued at repeated intervals within the discretion of the administering agency until the emergency has been resolved, parent-student reunification is complete, or until the administering agency determines that the issuance of a school emergency alert is no longer appropriate.\n      � 2. This local law takes effect 90 days after it becomes law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSession 12\nNAB\nLS #898\n3/14/2022 5:44 PM\n\nSession 11\nBG\nLS #5392\nInt. #872-2018\n\n1",
