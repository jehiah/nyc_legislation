  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Education (DOE) to report data to the Council concerning teacher retention and turnover. This bill would also require DOE to post data on each school’s website concerning teacher retention at each school. A task force would then be convened to analyze this data and issue a report with recommendations to address the issue. The task force would dissolve after it issues the report, but the reporting requirement would remain in place indefinitely.",
