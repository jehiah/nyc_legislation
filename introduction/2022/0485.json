  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to coordinate with the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DOITT), and any other relevant agency or office, to create and maintain an online website or portal with a directory of child care programs in the city. Such directory would be available in the designated citywide languages and would include, for each child care program: the program’s name, address and telephone number; ages served by such program; and the status of any permit or license required to operate the program. The directory would also include a search function that would allow users to search for child care programs by keywords, name, or location, including by borough and zip code. It would not include, however, the address or telephone number of any child care program located in a domestic violence shelter. In addition to information on child care programs, such website or portal would also include a clear and conspicuous link to a webpage that provides information on child day cares that are run by the state, but which are located within the city, and a description of the types of such child day cares.",
