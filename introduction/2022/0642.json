Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings:\n      Children's center. The term \"children's center\" means the Nicholas Scoppetta Children's Center or a successor center that is a temporary residence for children coming into foster care until a permanent placement is found. \n      Temporary placement facility. The term \"temporary placement facility\" means a facility for children in ACS custody awaiting a longer-term foster care placement. Such temporary placement facility includes but is not limited to rapid intervention centers, youth reception centers, and the children's center.\n      b. No later than April 30, 2022, and quarterly thereafter, ACS shall submit to the mayor and the speaker of the council, and shall post conspicuously on the ACS website, a report for the immediately preceding quarter regarding the amount of time children spend in the children's center or another temporary placement facility. The information in that report shall include and, where applicable, be disaggregated by:\n      1.
