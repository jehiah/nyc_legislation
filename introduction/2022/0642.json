Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings:\n      Children's center. The term \"children's center\" means the Nicholas Scoppetta Children's Center or a successor center that is a temporary residence for children coming into foster care until a permanent placement is found. \n      Temporary placement facility.
