  "Summary": "This bill would require an agency designated by the mayor to administer a public education program that informs the public regarding maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity. Additionally, no later than December 30, 2024, the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene would be required to report on the number of total births in the city for the previous calendar year, disaggregated, to the extent available, by the number of vaginal births, the number of vaginal births after prior cesarean section, the number of first-time cesarean sections, the number of repeat cesarean sections. This data would be further disaggregated by whether or not the pregnancy was considered low risk. The report would also include recommendations by the department to reduce maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity, including efforts to reduce the risks associated with unplanned cesarean sections and efforts to address inequities across patient demographics.",
