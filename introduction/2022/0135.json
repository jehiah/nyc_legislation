  "Summary": "This bill would require the New York City Department of Transportation (DOT) to issue a parking permit for vehicles owned or operated by an individual who has been certified by a physician as experiencing a difficult or complicated pregnancy (any pregnancy which results in impaired mobility). The permit would only be used for parking a vehicle where parking is prohibited by sign or rule, or allowing a vehicle to stand where standing is prohibited by sign or rule. Furthermore, the permit would be issued within 30 days after the DOT receives an application, and would expire 30 days after the expected delivery date. The towing of a vehicle bearing this permit would be prohibited when the vehicle is being used in accordance with the purpose of the permit, except when the NYPD determines a public safety emergency exists.",
