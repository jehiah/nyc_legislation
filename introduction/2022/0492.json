  "Summary": "This bill would require third-party food delivery services to agree to cover certain costs related to vehicle crashes that happen during deliveries. Unreimbursed costs incurred by delivery workers for crash-related medical treatment and property damage would be subject to coverage by the hiring third-party food delivery service. Third-party food delivery services that do not include such agreements in their contracts would face a $500 civil penalty for each noncompliant contract and third-party food delivery workers would be entitled to $1,000 in statutory damages if they are a party to a noncompliant contract.",
