  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n            Section 1. Subdivisions a and b of section 19-182 of the administrative code of the city of New York, subdivision a as amended by local law number 12 for the year 2011, subdivision b as amended by local law number 127 for the year 2013, are amended to read as follows:  \n      \ta. Every [five] four years, the department shall conduct a comprehensive study of all traffic crashes involving a pedestrian fatality or serious injury for the most recent [five] four years where traffic crash data is available. In each such study, the department shall analyze the conditions and factors associated with each such traffic crash and identify common factors among the crashes, if any. The department shall use such studies to develop strategies to improve pedestrian safety, which may include modifying citywide traffic operations policy, developing pedestrian safety strategies geared towards specific users, including, but not limited to, installation of audible pedestrian signals and other devices to assist those with sight, hearing and mobility impairments, prioritizing locations and/or types of roadways or intersections for safety improvements and making recommendations for improving safety at such locations.\n\tb. The first comprehensive traffic study and plans, including a schedule for implementing strategies for improving pedestrian safety generated by such study, shall be submitted to the mayor and speaker of the council and posted on the department's official website by the thirtieth day of november, two thousand and fifteen. Subsequent studies and plans shall be submitted to the mayor, [and] speaker of the council, and community boards and posted on the department's official website every [five] four years thereafter by the thirtieth of november [in such years].\t\n\t� 2. Subdivision d of Section 19-182.3 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 49 for the year 2021, is amended to read as follows:\n\td. Reporting. No later than April 30, 2022, and every three months thereafter, the department shall post on its website and send to the speaker of the council and community boards a report with information on each investigation completed during the preceding three month period ending thirty days prior. Nothing contained in this subdivision shall be construed to inhibit or interfere with the ability of the police department to pursue criminal investigations, or as otherwise conflicting with any obligation under the vehicle and traffic law regarding the investigation of vehicle crashes. Furthermore, nothing required to be reported by this subdivision shall be reported in a manner that would reveal the identity of a person or persons involved in a serious vehicular crash. Each such report shall include, but need not be limited to, the following:\n\t1. The total number of investigations completed;\n\t2. All evidence and data collected pursuant to each investigation;\n\t3. Determinations as to fault, including any potential criminal wrongdoing;\n\t4. Any factors that may have contributed to each crash, or increased or mitigated the severity of each such crash; and\n\t5. Whether changes to street design or improvements to infrastructure could reduce the risk of subsequent serious vehicular crashes, at each crash location or other similar locations, and a recommendation as to any such changes or improvements that should be made. \n\t� 3.
