  "Summary": "This proposed bill would codify NYC:ATWORK, a program of the Mayor’s Office for Persons with Disabilities (MOPD) that provides resources and direct support to job seekers and employers for the purpose of promoting employment of persons with disabilities in all employment sectors. This proposed bill would require the Department of Small Business Services (SBS), the Mayor’s Office of Talent and Workforce Development (MOTWD) and MOPD to collaborate to administer a workforce development program for persons with disabilities in NYC. This proposed bill would expand the existing NYC:ATWORK program by requiring SBS, MOTWD, and MOPD to maintain an online resource to connect employers and job seekers, which would include a current list of all vacant positions from participating employers. Resources would be made publicly available to support applicants with the job search process, and to provide employers with guidance on making accommodations, including by conducting informational sessions for employers at least twice annually. Additionally, the proposed bill would require SBS, MOTWD, and MOPD to carry out a public awareness campaign targeted at potential employers to facilitate participation in the program and employment of persons with disabilities.",
