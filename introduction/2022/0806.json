  "Summary": "This bill would require the establishment of borough-based population review teams to identify people in custody of the Department of Correction (“DOC”) whose cases could be resolved or who could be safely released into the community. The Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice (“MOCJ”) would be responsible for establishing the population review teams, convening meetings, providing sufficient staff to accomplish the goals of the population review teams, and making efforts to involve the relevant courts and district attorneys in the work of the population review teams. The population review teams would be composed of representatives from DOC, MOCJ, Correctional Health Services, the Department of Probation and public defenders. Each population review team would be required to meet twice a month to review individual cases and formalize recommendations for release. MOCJ would also be required to submit an annual report detailing the outcomes of the efforts of each population review team.",
