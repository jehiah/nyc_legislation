The Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice (“MOCJ”) would be responsible for establishing the population review program, which will review established criteria and provide materials to an incarcerated individual’s defense attorney at the earliest practicable date. MOCJ would also be required to submit a biannual report detailing the outcomes of the population review program.",
