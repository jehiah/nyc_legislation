  "Summary": "This bill would require the establishment of a jail population review program to identify people in custody of the Department of Correction (“DOC”) whose cases could be resolved or who could be safely released into the community. The Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice (“MOCJ”) would be responsible for establishing the population review program, which will review established criteria and provide materials to an incarcerated individual’s defense attorney at the earliest practicable date. MOCJ would also be required to submit a biannual report detailing the outcomes of the population review program.",
