  "Summary": "This local law would create a proactive inspection program where the Department of Housing Preservation and Development and the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene would identify at least 200 residential buildings each year that may pose a risk of lead exposure to children who reside in such buildings.  Inspectors would then inspect such buildings for any lead-based paint hazards and proceed to order that any such hazards be abated.",
