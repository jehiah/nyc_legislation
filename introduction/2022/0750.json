  "Summary": "This local law would create a proactive inspection program where the Department of Housing Preservation and Development and the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene would identify at least 200 residential buildings each year that may pose a risk of lead exposure to children who reside in such buildings.  Inspectors would then inspect such buildings for any lead-based paint hazards and proceed to order that any such hazards be abated.",

The department, in coordination with the department of health and mental hygiene, shall establish a program to identify and inspect at least 200 multiple dwellings each fiscal year where children reside and where there is a risk of exposure to lead-based paint hazards.  \n      b. Any inspection of a multiple dwelling unit required pursuant to this section shall be conducted notwithstanding any other lead inspection requirements pursuant to title 17 or title 27 of the code or of any rule that addresses lead-based paint hazards or unsafe lead paint in multiple dwellings, unless such dwelling unit was inspected for lead-based paint hazards within the preceding 5 years and any such hazards were abated. \n      c. Any inspection required pursuant to this section shall include an inspection of the dwelling unit for lead-based paint hazards or unsafe lead paint, as applicable, including analysis by an x-ray fluorescence analyzer, in accordance with subdivision (7) of section 27-2056.2, of all friction surfaces, chewable surfaces, peeling paint, deteriorated subsurfaces and impact surfaces as such terms are defined in section 27-2056.2.\n      d. In determining the multiple dwelling units that shall be inspected pursuant to this section the department shall consider, but not be limited to, the following factors:\n      1. A multiple dwelling's history of orders of abatement issued pursuant to subsection d of section 173.13 of the health code or a successor rule that addresses the abatement of lead hazards;\n      2. The relative prevalence of lead poisoning within the community district where a multiple dwelling is located; and\n      3.
