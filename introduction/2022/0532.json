  "Summary": "Federal law requires sufficient vessel waste pumpout facilities for a body of water to be designated a no-discharge zone for water protection purposes. This bill would require the Department of Environmental Protection to create a plan for establishing the city’s coastal waters as vessel no-discharge zones, to install at least three pumpout facilities per year until all coastal waters in the city are designated as no-discharge zones, to report annually on progress regarding the foregoing, and to ensure that no-discharge zones maintain their status as no-discharge zones once they are established.",

Section 22-112 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new subdivision f to read as follows:\n      f. 1. Definitions. For purposes of this subdivision, the term \"pumpout facility\" has the meaning ascribed to such term in the environmental conservation law.\n      2. Plan to establish no-discharge zones.

Every calendar year until all of the city's coastal waters are designated as no-discharge zones, the department of environmental protection shall install at least three public pumpout facilities.
