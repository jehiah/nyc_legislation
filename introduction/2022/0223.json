  "Summary": "This bill would prohibit telecommunications carriers and mobile applications from sharing a user’s location data with another person, if the location is within New York City. This bill would also prohibit anyone who receives such location data from sharing it with another person. The penalty for violating this prohibition would be $1,000 per violation, with a maximum penalty of $10,000 per day per person whose location data was unlawfully shared. The Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications would enforce this prohibition. This bill would also create a private right of action against telecommunications carriers and mobile application develops who violate this prohibition.",
