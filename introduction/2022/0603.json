  "Summary": "This bill would direct the Department of Buildings (DOB), with assistance from the Department of Environmental Protection, the Fire Department, and any other relevant agency, to conduct a year-long study to determine the feasibility of implementing solar-ready measures for commercial buildings. The DOB would then be required to submit a report to the Speaker of the Council and the Mayor with the results of this study.",

Identify any barriers to implementing solar-ready measures in commercial buildings; \n3. Identify any type of commercial building by use and occupancy classification that could incorporate solar-ready measures; and\n4. Assess the estimated costs of requiring solar-ready measures in commercial buildings\nthat can incorporate such measures. \n      � 3.
