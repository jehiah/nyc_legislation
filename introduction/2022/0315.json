  "Summary": "This bill would require that the Department of Environmental Protection triennially study vacant and underutilized City-owned sites for the potential to be used for renewable energy generation.  Such sites would include closed and capped landfills and brownfields. The Department would submit a proposed feasibility study to the Mayor and Speaker of the Council at least three months before submitting their final report.",

Chapter 8 of title 24 of the administrative code is amended by adding a new section 24-806.1 to read as follows: \n      � 24-806.1 Renewable energy generation on vacant city-owned lots. a. On or before December 31, 2023, and by December 31 every three years thereafter, the department shall submit to the mayor and the speaker of the council a report identifying all vacant and underutilized municipally-owned sites, including closed- and capped-solid waste landfills and brownfields, that would be suitable for the development of renewable energy. Such report shall include an assessment of the feasibility of renewable energy generation and a cost-benefit analysis of solar or wind energy generation on such sites.\n      b.  The department shall submit to the mayor and speaker of the council a draft of such study no less than 90 days before the submission of the final report. If the study concludes that no greater use may be made from a particular vacant or underutilized site, the department shall explain its reasons therefor. \n      c. For each such vacant or underutilized site the department identifies would not be suitable for generating solar or wind energy, the department shall re-evaluate such site in the subsequent triennial report and determine whether generation of solar or wind energy from such site would be more feasible at that time.\n      � 2.
