  "Summary": "This bill would require that the Mayor designate an agency/office, in coordination with the Department of Parks and Recreation and the Department of Transportation, to report on feasible locations for public bathroom facilities in each of the City’s Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs), except in ZCTAs where the agency/office determines bathroom installation would not be suitable because the ZCTA contains only a single commercial building, education facility, or residential complex, or the ZCTA is comprised entirely of industrial zones. The report would also identify the number of currently operational public bathroom facilities in each ZCTA, accessibility and safety measures necessary for bathroom installation, and potential barriers to installation and maintenance. The bill would also require that the agency/office consider public and community board input and provide recommendations for overcoming any identified barriers regarding locations suitable for public bathrooms.",

Such report shall also include, but need not be limited to, the following information:\n      1. The factors considered in determining whether an identified location is appropriate for installing a public bathroom facility;\n      2.
