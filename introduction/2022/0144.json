  "Summary": "This bill would repeal the current Civilian Complaint Review Board and create an Elected Civilian Review Board elected by seventeen designated districts. The bill would set the term limits and eligibility requirements for board members, establish the subject matter jurisdiction of the agency, and grant the agency full control over its disciplinary process. The bill would also establish an elected independent prosecutor for criminal cases against officers acting under the color of law in New York city. Finally, the bill would repeal the independent police investigation and audit board.",
