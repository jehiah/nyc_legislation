  "Summary": "This bill would require the Office to End Domestic and Gender-Based Violence (ENDGBV) to establish a two-year pilot program to provide 1,000 pilot program participants with a stipend and the assistance of a survivor advocate, a non-attorney advocate who provides program participants with information and support, to help the participants navigate the changing of dwelling unit door locks and connect them with support services. ENDGBV, in consultation with the relevant agencies and designated organizations, would conduct a feasibility study and use the feasibility study report recommendations to design the program. ENDGBV, in consultation with the relevant agencies and designated organizations, would have the pilot advocates issue a baseline survey to the participants to assess the impact of the program on the participants’ quality of life. ENDGBV would also produce two reports on the program, a progress report and a final report.",
