  "Summary": "This bill would require nightlife establishments to post signs informing patrons about harassment and to annually train employees about harassment among patrons. The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) would enforce the penalty for failing to post signs—a civil penalty of not more than $500 for each violation. DCWP would also inspect establishments’ training records upon request.",
