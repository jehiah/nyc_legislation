  "Summary": "This bill would create a new definition for green building project, defined as a building or renovation project that will produce, from renewable resources, a decrease in carbon, or carbon equivalent, emissions in a percentage of no less than 50 percent of the building’s prior year emissions. This bill would also waive any building permit, inspection, or other service fees for a green building project undertaken on one- to three-family homes when the owner submits documentation demonstrating a sufficient decrease in emissions.",
