  "Summary": "Dynamic-parking zones are areas of high traffic congestion where a demand-based parking fee would be implemented. This bill would require the Department of Transportation (DOT) to create at least one dynamic parking zone per borough where the parking rates would rise or fall depending on real-time demand. The range in which rates can rise or fall must be set by DOT prior to implementation and can only be changed with one week’s notice. Finally, any vehicle currently exempt from metered parking requirements due to a special vehicle identification permit will also be exempt from dynamic-parking fees.",
