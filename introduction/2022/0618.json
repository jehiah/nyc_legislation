  "Summary": "This local law would prohibit the City Council from adopting a budget for the ensuing fiscal year that would require a property tax levy to be generated that is either two percent or the rate of inflation larger, whichever is less, than the prior year’s property tax levy. The Council may authorize the passage of a budget with a larger-than-authorized levy, it is passes a resolution with a two-thirds majority stating the reasons why the exception for the ensuing fiscal year is needed.",

The term \"inflation factor\" means the quotient of: (a) the average of the   national consumer price indexes determined by the United States department of labor for the twelve-month period ending six months prior to the start of the coming fiscal year minus the average of the national consumer price indexes determined by the United States department of   labor  for  the twelve-month period ending six months prior to the start of the prior fiscal year, divided by (b) the average of the national consumer price indexes determined by the United States department of labor for the twelve-month period ending six months prior to the start of the prior fiscal year, with the result expressed as a decimal to four places.\n      Tax levy limit.
