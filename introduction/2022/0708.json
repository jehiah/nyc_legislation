  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation (“DOT”) to redesign the city’s truck route network to improve safety, increase visibility, reduce traffic congestion, and reduce vehicle miles traveled.  In redesigning the network, this bill would require DOT to consult with City agencies, community boards and business improvement districts, and representatives from businesses, environmental and climate justice organizations, street safety organizations, and the trucking, logistics and last-mile delivery industries. The bill would also require that DOT assess whether daylighting or daylighting barriers should be implemented at intersections on the truck route network, and review and replace truck route signage where necessary.",
