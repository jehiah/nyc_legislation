  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation (“DOT”) to redesign the city’s truck route network to improve safety, increase visibility, reduce traffic congestion and emissions, and reduce vehicle miles traveled.  In redesigning the network, this bill would require DOT to consult with City agencies, affected residents, and representatives from businesses, environmental and climate justice organizations, street safety organizations, industrial business zone administrators, and the trucking, logistics and last-mile delivery industries. The bill would also require that DOT implement daylighting at each intersection adjacent to the truck route network, and review and replace truck route signage where necessary.",
