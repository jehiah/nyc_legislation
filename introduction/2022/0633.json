  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Environmental Protection and the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to permanently establish the COVID-19 Wastewater Testing Program initially established through Local Law 28 of 2021. This bill would also require publication of the results of wastewater testing under the program on the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene’s website on a weekly basis. Finally, the bill would also require DOHMH, in consultation with DEP, to submit a report on the COVID-19 wastewater Testing Program to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council by August 31 of each year.",

Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings:\n      PCR using N1 primer. The term \"PCR using N1 primer\" means the measurement of the copies of the targeted viral RNA segment in wastewater sample using a polymerase chain reaction based method.\n      SARS-CoV-2. The term \"SARS-CoV-2\" means severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, which is the strain of coronavirus that causes the disease COVID-19.\n      Wastewater-based epidemiology.
