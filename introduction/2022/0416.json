  "Summary": "This bill would require the Office of Emergency Management, in consultation with the Mayor’s Office of Food Policy and the Department of Education (DOE) to develop a plan to provide students with breakfast, lunch and dinner in the event that City schools are ordered closed either by the governor, mayor or chancellor, or when any form of remote learning is being used by the DOE. The DOE already provides free breakfast, lunch and afterschool meals to all NYC public school students during the school year. This bill would ensure that in the event of an emergency or public health crisis that shutters schools, students will still be able to receive the meals they would normally receive in school and thus ensure their food security.",
