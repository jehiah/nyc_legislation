  "Summary": "This bill would rename Rikers Island as Kalief Browder Island. It would also remove references to Rikers Island in the City Charter, Administrative Code and any print, online or other publications produced by New York City agencies after the effective date.",
  "TextID": 66218,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Legislative intent. As New York City works to reform its draconian and racially discriminatory criminal justice system, such work must include a review of the public markers that need to change to align with present day principles. One such opportunity is Rikers Island. The Riker name has historic ties to slavery. The correctional facility also has a reputation for the abuse and neglect of incarcerated individuals. One example is Kalief Browder, an African American man from the Bronx, who advocates cite in calling for closing the correctional facilities and reforming the city criminal justice system.\n      In 2010, at the age of 16, Browder was accused of stealing a backpack and its contents including $700, a credit card, a camera and an iPod Touch. Unable to afford bail, he was jailed on Rikers Island for three years with nearly two years in solitary confinement. The judge released Browder on May 29, 2013 after finding his case lacked evidence and the main witness left the United States. After his release, Browder passed the G.E.D. exam and enrolled at Bronx Community College where he wrote a paper, \"A Closer Look at Solitary Confinement in the United States\", which garnered national recognition. On June 6, 2015, Browder died by suicide, hanging himself outside of his mother's home. Many attribute his suicide to the mental and physical abuse he sustained during detention. He attempted suicide five times while detained and three times post detention and suffered from depression post release. \n      Accordingly, in light of the name of Rikers Island having historic ties to slavery and the life and death of Kalief Browder, the Council proposes to rename Rikers Island as Kalief Browder Island and replace Rikers Island with Kalief Browder Island in the city charter, the administrative code and any future publications produced by New York city agencies.\n      � 2. The following island, in the Borough of the Bronx, is hereby designated as hereafter indicated.  \nNew Name\n Present Name \nKalief Browder Island\n Rikers Island \n \n      � 3. The official map of the city of New York shall be amended in accordance with section two of this local law.\n      � 4. Subdivision e of section 13-c of the New York city charter, as amended by chapter 322 of the laws of 2021, is amended to read as follows:\n      e. Four-year plan. Within one year after the completion of the first biennial report required by subdivision d of this section, and in every fourth calendar year thereafter, the coordinator shall prepare and submit to the mayor and the council a four-year plan for providing reentry services to those city residents who need such services. Such plan may include recommendations for approaches to serving city residents in need of reentry services, including the establishment of an initial point of access for individuals immediately upon their release from the custody of the department of correction in a location adjacent to [Rikers Island] Kalief Browder Island or to the correctional facility that releases the most incarcerated individuals daily. Such report and plan shall also identify obstacles to making such services available to all those who need them and describe what additional resources would be necessary to do so.\n      � 5. Subdivision 2 of section 2-202 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\n      2. The borough of The Bronx shall consist of the territory known as Bronx county which shall contain all that part of the city and state bounded on the east by the middle of the main channel of Long Island sound; bounded on the south by the following described line: Beginning at a point in the middle of the channel of Long Island sound where it intersects the middle of the channel of the East river easterly of Throgg's neck; thence westerly along the middle of the channel of the East river to a point where such channel crosses a straight line from the Clason point in the borough and county of the Bronx to College point on Long Island; thence southwesterly to the most easterly point of the United States bulkhead line of [Rikers Island] Kalief Browder Island; thence generally southerly and westerly along said United States bulkhead line of [Rikers Island] Kalief Browder Island to the most southerly point of said United States bulkhead line; thence westerly still along said United States bulkhead line to the most southwesterly point of said United States bulkhead line of [Rikers Island] Kalief Browder Island; thence northwesterly in a straight line to the junction of the northerly United States bulkhead line of the Bronx kills and the northerly United States bulkhead line of the East river; thence bounded on the west by the borough of Manhattan and county of New York and by the westerly boundary of the state, and bounded on the north by the following described line: Beginning at a point in the Hudson river where the westerly boundary of the state crosses the westerly prolongation of a straight line drawn from a point on the easterly bank of the Hudson river at latitude 40 degree 54' 53.21\" north and longitude 73 degree 54' 38.64\" west of Greenwich to a point in the center of the former bed of the Bronx river at latitude 40 degree 53' 59.23\" north and longitude 73 degree 51' 35.67\" west of Greenwich; thence easterly along such line to a point formed by the intersection of such line with the center line of East Two hundred fortieth street; thence easterly along the center line of such street, a distance of 62.23 feet;

Legislative intent. As New York City works to reform its draconian and racially discriminatory criminal justice system, such work must include a review of the public markers that need to change to align with present day principles. One such opportunity is Rikers Island. The Riker name has historic ties to slavery. The correctional facility also has a reputation for the abuse and neglect of incarcerated individuals. One example is Kalief Browder, an African American man from the Bronx, who advocates cite in calling for closing the correctional facilities and reforming the city criminal justice system.\\par\nIn 2010, at the age of 16, Browder was accused of stealing a backpack and its contents including $700, a credit card, a camera and an iPod Touch. Unable to afford bail, he was jailed on Rikers Island for three years with nearly two years in solitary confinement. The judge released Browder on May 29, 2013 after finding his case lacked evidence and the main witness left the United States. After his release, Browder passed the G.E.D. exam and enrolled at Bronx Community College where he wrote a paper, \\ldblquote A Closer Look at Solitary Confinement in the United States\\rdblquote , which garnered national recognition. On June 6, 2015, Browder died by suicide, hanging himself outside of his mother\\rquote s home. Many attribute his suicide to the mental and physical abuse he sustained during detention. He attempted suicide five times while detained and three times post detention and suffered from depression post release. \\par\nAccordingly, in light of the name of Rikers Island having historic ties to slavery and the life and death of Kalief Browder, the Council proposes to rename Rikers Island as Kalief Browder Island and replace Rikers Island with Kalief Browder Island in the city charter, the administrative code and any future publications produced by New York city agencies.\\par\n\\'a7 2.

Such plan may include recommendations for approaches to serving city residents in need of reentry services, including the establishment of an initial point of access for individuals immediately upon their release from the custody of the department of correction in a location adjacent to [Rikers Island] \\ul Kalief Browder Island\\ulnone  or to the correctional facility that releases the most incarcerated individuals daily. Such report and plan shall also identify obstacles to making such services available to all those who need them and describe what additional resources would be necessary to do so.\\par\n\\'a7 5.
