  "Summary": "This bill would amend the New York City Fire Code to authorize the outdoor use of portable gas-fueled heating devices. Currently, the Fire Code limits such portable devices to be those fueled by piped natural gas. This bill would expand the scope of authorized equipment to include portable heating devices fueled by liquefied petroleum gas, also known as propane. The bill would require safety precautions related to the operation and handling of such devices.",
