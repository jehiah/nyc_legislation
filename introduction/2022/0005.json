  "Summary": "This bill would require property owners to produce records for the immediately previous year, including the annual notice, and, where appropriate, investigations conducted by such owner, including x-ray fluorescence analysis after August 1, 2025, whenever a violation for lead-based paint hazards has been issued by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (“HPD”). This bill would establish a process for building owners to correct violations for the keeping or producing of records for 10 years. When a building owner receives a violation for record keeping, they can correct the violation by submitting a violation dismissal request form with the required 10 years of records. Alternatively, the owner may submit a violation dismissal request form with documentation demonstrating the owner’s record keeping for at least 3 consecutive years and, upon the HPD finding this documentation sufficient, the owner must pay $1,000 for each year for which the documentation is not submitted.",
