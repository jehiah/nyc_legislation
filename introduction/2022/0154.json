  "Summary": "This bill would require the Mayor’s Office to End Domestic and Gender-Based Violence (ENDGBV) to establish an online portal and a written resource guide of available services for survivors of domestic or gender-based violence in New York City. The portal and guide would be available in the designated citywide languages. The guide would also be available in Braille. The portal would also include a clear and conspicuous link to any other relevant City-run websites and portals that provide information on survivor services located within the city, and a description of the types of such resources. The bill would also require ENDGBV to conduct outreach on the portal and guide and ensure the portal is secure and confidential to protect the privacy of survivors.",
