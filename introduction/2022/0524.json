  "Summary": "This bill would authorize the New York City Banking Commission to recommend, and the Council to adopt, an interest rate that would be applicable to the property tax arrears that accrue while an eligible property with an assessed value of $250,000 or less is the subject of a valid payment agreement plan with the Department of Finance. Eligible properties must be the primary resident of the homeowner(s) whose total income does not exceed $200,000. These threshold cover 82 percent on New York City primary resident homeowners. The rate recommended by the Banking Commission must be at least equal to the most recently determined federal short-term interest rate rounded to the nearest half percent. The Department of Finance must conduct outreach for the new rate and report back to the Mayor and the Speaker.  In addition, the local law would repeal provisions requiring the Banking Commission to make certain recommendations for interest rates for the nonpayment of water and sewer rents because those provisions are preempted by a State law setting such interest rates.",
  "TextID": 74237,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Subdivision (e) of section 11-224.1 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 24 for the year 2021, is amended to read as follows:\n      (e) Council adopted rates. By May thirteenth of each year, the banking commission shall send a written recommendation to the council of a proposed interest rate to be charged for nonpayment of taxes on real property. The commission shall consider the prevailing interest rates charged for commercial loans extended to prime borrowers by commercial banks operating in the city and:\n      (i) for real property with an assessed value of two hundred fifty thousand dollars or less, shall propose a rate at least equal to such prevailing prime rate, except as provided in paragraph (ii) of this subdivision;\n      (ii) for real property with an assessed value of two hundred fifty thousand dollars or less for which an owner, as defined in subdivision (h) of this section, of such real property: (A) has entered into an agreement pursuant to section 11-322 or 11-322.1 of chapter 3 of this title for the payment in installments of real property taxes, assessments or other charges that are made a lien subject to the provisions of such chapter other than water rents, sewer rents or sewer surcharges, and such installment agreement is not in default; and (B) has complied with the requirements described in subdivision (h) of this section, the commission shall consider the most recent federal short-term rate, as determined by the United States secretary of the treasury in accordance with subsection (d) of section 1247 of the internal revenue code, for use in connection with section 6621 of the internal revenue code, and shall propose a rate at least equal to such federal short-term rate rounded to the nearest half percent;\n       (iii) for real property with an assessed value of over two hundred fifty thousand dollars but no greater than four hundred fifty thousand dollars, shall propose a rate of at least four percent per annum greater than such prevailing prime rate;\n      [(iii)] (iv) for real property with an assessed value of over four hundred fifty thousand dollars, shall propose a rate of at least six percent per annum greater than such prevailing prime rate.\n      The council may by resolution adopt interest rates to be applicable to the aforementioned properties and may specify in such resolution the date that such rates will take effect.\n      � 2. Section 11-224.1 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding new subdivisions (h) and (h-1) to read as follows:\n      (h) Requirements relating to charging the interest rate described in paragraph (ii) of subdivision (e) of this section for nonpayment of taxes on real property.\n      (i) Qualification for such interest rate for certain real property without an application.
