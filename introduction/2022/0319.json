  "Summary": "This law would require the department of health and mental hygiene to make automatic external defibrillators available to primary, intermediate and high schools that do not already receive such devices. An automated external defibrillator is a device that can stop irregular heart rhythms or restart a heart after sudden cardiac arrest by conveying an electronic shock to the heart (through the chest).",

For purposes of this section, the term \"automated external defibrillator\" shall mean a medical device, approved by the United States food and drug administration, that: (i) is capable of recognizing the presence or absence in a patient of ventricular fibrillation and rapid ventricular tachycardia; (ii) is capable of determining, without intervention by an individual, whether defibrillation should be performed on a patient; (iii) upon determining that defibrillation should be performed, automatically charges and requests delivery of an electrical impulse to a patient's heart; and (iv) upon action by an individual, delivers an appropriate electrical impulse to a patient's heart to perform defibrillation.\n      b. The department shall provide automated external defibrillators to schools upon request in quantities deemed adequate in accordance with rules promulgated pursuant to subdivision c of this section and in accordance with section 3000-b of the New York state public health law to each primary, intermediate and high school located within the city of New York that is not eligible to receive automated external defibrillators under section 917 of the New York state education law or any other provision of law and that submits a written request to the department.  Any school receiving automated external defibrillators pursuant to this subdivision shall ensure that such devices are readily accessible for use during medical emergencies.  Any information regarding use of automated external defibrillators deemed necessary by the department in accordance with rules promulgated pursuant to subdivision c of this section shall accompany and be kept with each automated external defibrillator.

Nothing contained in this section shall impose any duty or obligation on any person to provide assistance with an automated external defibrillator to a victim of a medical emergency.\n      e. Any person who, in accordance with the provisions of this section, voluntarily and without expectation of monetary compensation renders first aid or emergency treatment using an automated external defibrillator that has been made available pursuant to this section, to a person who is unconscious, ill or injured, and any person, agency, school or other entity that acquires or makes available an automated external defibrillator pursuant to this section, shall be entitled to the limitation of liability provided in section 3000-a of the New York state public health law.\n                     f.
