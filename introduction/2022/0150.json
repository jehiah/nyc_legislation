  "Summary": "This bill would require that 40% of all parking spaces in existing garages and open lots be capable of supporting electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) by 2030.  This bill would also require that 10% of parking spaces in existing garages and open lots install electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) by 2030 and 20% of such spaces install EVSE by 2035.  Where an existing garage or open lot undergoes an alteration, at the time of such alteration, 40% of all parking spaces must be capable of supporting EVCS.  At the time of alteration, 10% of all spots must also install EVSE. For new garages and lots, 60% of all parking spaces and lots must be capable of supporting EVCS and 20% of all spots shall install EVSE.",
