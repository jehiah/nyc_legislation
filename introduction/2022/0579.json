  "Summary": "This bill would prohibit third-party grocery delivery services from requiring grocery delivery workers to deliver goods in a single trip if the goods weigh more than 22 pounds collectively. This bill would also prohibit third-party grocery delivery services from requiring grocery delivery workers to wear backpacks if they deliver goods by bicycle, scooter or moped. Grocery delivery workers would have the option to make heavier deliveries or to wear backpacks. Retaliation against grocery deliver workers who exercise the rights established in this bill would be prohibited, and violations would be punishable through various enforcement options.",
