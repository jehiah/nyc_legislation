  "Summary": "This bill would repeal Department of Consumer and Worker Protection sidewalk café licensing provisions in title 20 of the Administrative Code and amend provisions that created a temporary outdoor dining program in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It would create a new permanent outdoor dining program, which, in addition to sidewalk cafes, would allow seasonal roadway dining and be administered by the Department of Transportation.",

Any person owning, leasing, managing or operating a ground floor restaurant upon property which abuts upon any street may establish and operate a sidewalk cafe upon the sidewalk of such street in an area immediately adjacent to its premises, or a roadway cafe upon the roadway adjacent to the curb in front of such ground floor restaurant, or both, provided that such sidewalk cafe or roadway cafe be granted a license and a revocable consent by the commissioner.

A license to operate a sidewalk cafe shall be granted after the review and approval of a petition for a revocable consent to establish and operate such cafe pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter and the rules of the department. A license to operate a roadway cafe shall be granted after the review and approval of a petition for a revocable consent to establish and operate such cafe pursuant to chapter 14 of the charter, the provisions of this subchapter, and the rules of the department. An operator of a sidewalk cafe or roadway cafe who is licensed by the commissioner shall cause the boundary of the area licensed as a sidewalk cafe or roadway cafe to be marked in a manner prescribed pursuant to rules of the department.\n            d.

Where in accordance with applicable law alcohol may be served at a ground floor restaurant, a licensee must provide table service to patrons seated in the sidewalk cafe or roadway cafe.\n            j. The license to establish and operate a sidewalk cafe or a roadway cafe shall be personal to the applicant and may not be sold, leased or transferred and shall be deemed revoked by the sale or transfer of the lease or of title to the building or structure to which the sidewalk cafe or roadway cafe is related.\n            � 19-160.1 Review and approval of petitions for revocable consents to establish and operate roadway cafes.  \n            a. It shall be unlawful for any person to establish or operate a roadway cafe without a revocable consent granted pursuant to chapter 14 of the charter, this section and any rules adopted by the commissioner pursuant thereto. \n            b. The petition shall be in such form as prescribed by the department and established by rule and shall be reviewed by the department and other relevant agencies as determined by the department.\n            c. Revocable consents for roadway cafes shall provide for fees to be paid annually to the city during the continuance of the consent. Such fees shall be calculated pursuant to a formula established by rule, which shall apply uniformly to all revocable consents for roadway cafes.  \n            d. A roadway cafe may not be opened or operated prior to the approval of a petition for a consent therefor by the department pursuant to this section and any rules promulgated by the department. \n            e.  The department shall provide notice of a petition for a revocable consent for a roadway cafe to the affected community board, in a manner prescribed in the department's rules.\n            f. A revocable consent granted pursuant to this section may be renewed pursuant to rules of the department.\n            � 19-160.2 Review and approval of petitions for revocable consents to establish and operate sidewalk cafes. A petition for a revocable consent to establish and operate a sidewalk cafe shall be reviewed and approved in the following manner:\n            a. The petition shall be in such form as prescribed by the department. The department shall forward copies of the petition, within five days of the filing of such petition, to the president of the borough in which the cafe is proposed to be located, the speaker of the council and the council member in whose district the cafe is proposed to be located, for information purposes, and to the community board for the community district in which the cafe is proposed to be located, for review pursuant to subdivision b of this section.\n            b. The community board shall, not later than 30 days after receipt of such petition, either (i) notify the public of the petition, conduct a public hearing thereon and submit a written recommendation to the department and to the council or (ii) waive by a written statement its public hearing and recommendation on such petition and submit such statement to the department and to the council. The petitioner shall amend the petition if both the community board and the petitioner agree to modifications in writing. Such modifications shall be reflected in the written recommendations of the community board to the department and the council. If the community board submits a recommendation on a petition after the 30-day time period has expired, such recommendation may be accepted by the department at the sole discretion of the department.\n            c. Within 30 days after the expiration of the period allowed for the filing of a recommendation or waiver by the community board pursuant to subdivision b of this section, the department shall (i) hold a public hearing on the petition, provided that such hearing is required pursuant to subdivision d of this section, (ii) approve the petition, disapprove it or approve it with modifications, and (iii) file with the council any such decision to approve or approve with modifications, together with the petition.\n            d. The public hearing described by subdivision c of this section shall be held  when (i) the community board has submitted a recommendation to deny such petition or (ii) the community board has submitted a recommendation to approve such petition with modifications or conditions. Such hearing may also be held when the department determines that such hearing would be beneficial to address a concern with the effect of the proposed sidewalk cafe at the proposed location. One or more petitions may be heard at the same public hearing upon a determination that doing so is in the public interest. For a period of not less than 15 calendar days prior to the date of such public hearing, the petitioner shall post notice of the public hearing in a place conspicuous to public view at the location of the proposed sidewalk cafe. At least 15 days prior to the date of the hearing, the department will give notice to the community board for the district in which the cafe is proposed to be located, to the president of the borough in which the cafe is proposed to be located and to the council member in whose district the cafe is proposed to be located. Not less than five calendar days prior to the date of any such hearing, notice of the hearing shall be published in the City Record and in the print or online edition of one newspaper of local circulation in the community where the cafe is proposed to be located. \n            e. Within 20 days of the date the petition is received by the council pursuant to subdivision c of this section, the council may resolve by majority vote of all the council members to review the petition. If the council does not so resolve, the approval of the petition by the department shall be forwarded to the mayor for approval pursuant to subdivision g of this section, unless, in accordance with such subdivision, the petition is one for which the mayor has determined that separate and additional mayoral approval is not required.\n            f. If the council resolves to review a petition pursuant to subdivision e of this section, the council shall hold a public hearing, after giving public notice not less than five days in advance of such hearing. The council shall take final action on the petition and shall file with the mayor its resolution, if any, with respect to the petition, except that if, in accordance with subdivision g of this section, the petition is one for which the mayor has determined that separate and additional mayoral approval is not required, the council shall file its resolution with the department. Such filing of the resolution shall take place within 35 days of the filing of the petition with the council pursuant to subdivision c of this section. The affirmative vote of a majority of all the council members shall be required to approve, approve with modifications or disapprove the petition. Any modification by the council shall not affect the terms of any proposed revocable consent agreement which relate to term, compensation, revocability, exclusivity, security, insurance, indemnification, erection, operation, maintenance or removal of any structure, right of access by the city and rights of abutting property owners. If within the time period provided for in this subdivision, the council fails to act or fails to act by the required vote on a petition, the council shall be deemed to have approved the petition. If within the time period provided for in this subdivision, the council approves the petition with modifications, the petitioner shall accept such modifications within 15 days of such approval, or the council shall be deemed to have denied the petition.\n            g. (1) The term of the revocable consent shall be one license period and shall be concurrent with such license period. The term of the renewal of such revocable consent shall be two consecutive license periods and shall be concurrent with such license periods.\n            (2) The consent shall be upon such conditions as may be provided in the approval of the petition by the department, as such approval may be modified by action of the council pursuant to subdivision f of this section, but shall be revocable at any time by the department.
