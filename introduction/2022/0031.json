  "Summary": "This bill would amend the sidewalk café licensing provisions in title 20 of the Administrative Code to streamline the existing licensing and revocable consent process, and to add provisions permitting roadway dining on a seasonal basis. It would also give restaurants time to transition from the emergency outdoor dining program created in response to the COVID-19 pandemic while petitioning for a sidewalk or roadway café license. Further, the bill would update the Street Vendor Enforcement Unit’s mandate to address other street commerce activity, including sidewalk and roadway café violations.",

Any person found to be operating an unlicensed sidewalk cafe or roadway cafe shall be liable for a civil penalty of $200 for the first violation and $200 for each additional violation occurring on the same day; $500 for the second violation and for each additional violation occurring on the same day; and $1,000 for each subsequent violation at the same place of business within a two-year period, except that any person found to be operating an unlicensed small sidewalk caf� shall be liable for a civil penalty of $50 for the first violation and $50 for each additional violation occurring on the same day; $100 for the second violation and for each additional violation occurring on the same day; and $250 for each subsequent violation at the same place of business within a two-year period. \n            b. Any holder of a sidewalk cafe or roadway cafe license found to be operating a cafe in violation of: (i) this subchapter, (ii) the terms and conditions of such license, (iii) a revocable consent, or (iv) rules promulgated by the commissioner pursuant to this subchapter, shall be liable for a civil penalty of $200 for the first violation, and $200 for each additional violation occurring on the same day; and $500 for the second violation and each subsequent violation at the same place of business within a two year period, except that any holder of a license for a small sidewalk caf� found to be in violation of: (i) this subchapter, (ii) the terms and conditions of such license, (iii) a revocable consent, or (iv) rules promulgated by the commissioner pursuant to this subchapter, shall be liable for a civil penalty of $50 for the first violation and $50 for each additional violation occurring on the same day; $100 for the second violation and for each additional violation occurring on the same day; and $250 for each subsequent violation at the same place of business within a two-year period.  \n            c. In addition to any other enforcement procedures authorized by this subchapter, the department may, after providing notice and an opportunity to be heard, suspend or revoke a license to operate a sidewalk or roadway cafe and order the removal or sealing of such sidewalk or roadway cafe for three or more violations of this subchapter or rules of the department within a two year period.\n            d.  For purposes of this section, a subsequent license holder shall be liable for violations by a prior license holder unless the subsequent license holder provides the department with adequate documentation demonstrating that the subsequent license holder acquired the premises or business through an arm's length transaction and that the sale or lease was not conducted, in whole or in part, for the purpose of permitting the original license holder to avoid the effect of violations on the premises. For purposes of this subdivision, the term \"arm's length transaction\" means a sale of a fee or all undivided interests in real property, or lease of any part thereof, or a sale of a business, in good faith and for valuable consideration, that reflects the fair market value of such real property, lease or business in the open market between two informed and willing parties, where neither party is under any compulsion to participate in the transaction, unaffected by any unusual conditions indicating a reasonable possibility that the sale or lease was made for the purpose of permitting the original licensee to avoid the effect of violations on the premises. The following sales or leases shall be presumed not to be arm's length transactions unless adequate documentation is provided demonstrating that the sale or lease was not conducted, in whole or in part, for the purpose of permitting the original licensee to avoid the effect of violations on the premises:\n            (1) a sale between relatives;\n            (2) a sale between related companies or partners in a business; or\n            (3) a sale or lease affected by other facts or circumstances that would indicate that the sale or lease is entered into for the primary purpose of permitting the original licensee to avoid the effect of violations on the premises.\n            e. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of this section, any person found to be operating an unlicensed sidewalk cafe or roadway cafe or any holder of a license found to be operating a sidewalk cafe or roadway cafe in violation of this subchapter, the terms and conditions of such license or a revocable consent, or rules promulgated by the department pursuant to this subchapter shall be subject to a civil penalty of zero dollars for a first violation, if such person or holder of a license proves to the satisfaction of the department, within 30 days of the issuance of the notice of violation and prior to the commencement of an adjudication of the violation, that the violation has been cured. The submission of proof of a cure, if accepted by the department as proof that the violation has been cured, shall be deemed an admission of liability for all purposes. The option of presenting proof that the violation has been cured shall be offered as part of any settlement offer made by the department to such person or holder of a license who has received, for the first time, a notice of violation of this subchapter or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder. The department shall permit such proof to be submitted electronically or in person. Such person or holder of a license may seek review, in the department's administrative tribunal, of the determination that such person or holder of a license has not submitted proof of a cure within 15 days of receiving written notification of such determination.\n            f. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provisions of this section, the decision to suspend or revoke a license shall be waived if, upon the submission of satisfactory proof, the department determines that the person or persons who committed the violations which are the basis for the suspension or revocation acted against the licensee's instructions in committing such violations.\n            g. The commissioner may order the removal of any furniture, equipment, structure or other obstruction used in connection with the operation of an outdoor dining area on the sidewalk or in the roadway by a person who is not licensed to operate a sidewalk cafe or roadway cafe pursuant to this subchapter and has no other lawful right to operate an outdoor dining area on such sidewalk or in such roadway or where any furniture, equipment, structure or other obstruction placed on the sidewalk or roadway by a licensee is inconsistent with criteria or design for such area as set forth in the rules of the department. Such order shall be served in the manner provided by the rules of the department and shall afford the person to whom such order is directed an opportunity to be heard in accordance with such rules. Where such order has not been complied with within a reasonable period of time as set forth in such order, officers or employees of the department or the police department may remove such furniture, equipment, structure or other obstruction from the sidewalk or the roadway and convey them to a place of safety. Where the department has an address for the person to whom such order was directed, within 30 days of removal, the department shall mail to such person notice of such removal and the manner in which such furniture, equipment, structure or other obstruction may be claimed. Such furniture, equipment, structure or other obstructions shall not be released until all removal charges and storage fees have been paid or a bond or other security for such amount has been posted. Any furniture, equipment, structure or other obstructions that are not claimed shall be disposed of in accordance with applicable law and the rules of the department. Nothing in this section is intended to alter or affect the power of the commissioner to immediately remove any obstruction from the sidewalk or roadway that the commissioner determines is a danger to public safety.\n            � 8.
