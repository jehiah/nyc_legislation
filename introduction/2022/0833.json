  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of City Planning (DCP), or if the City Planning Commission (CPC) is not the lead agency, the lead agency, to report on the transportation impacts in areas affected by neighborhood rezonings.  Each study would require a comparison of the impacts in existence at the time of the study to the potential impacts identified in the final environmental impact statement (EIS) approved by the City Planning Commission in connection with such rezoning.  If there are significant disparities between the impacts identified in the study and those identified in the EIS, DCP or the lead agency shall make recommendations on how to amend the CEQR Technical Manual to more accurately forecast such impacts in future land use actions. As part of that report, DCP or the lead agency would be required to discuss whether a vehicle miles traveled model would more accurately and usefully capture project impacts. The bill would require DCP or the lead agency to submit such studies and reports four years and ten years after final approval of a neighborhood rezoning.",

In connection with each covered land use action certified by the city planning commission on or after January 1, 2019, the department or, if the city planning commission is not the lead agency, the lead agency, in coordination with the department of transportation, shall conduct studies of transportation impacts in the relevant study area for the following periods: \n      1. from the date of final approval of such covered land use action to a date four years after such final approval; and\n      2. from the date of final approval of such covered land use action to a date 10 years after such final approval. \n      c.
