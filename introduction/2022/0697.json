  "Summary": "This bill would amend the City’s Language Access Law to require that agency language access plans include language services for groups that have specific priority processing levels according to the U.S. State Department. It would also apply to languages spoken by people in countries that were designated for temporary protected status by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and languages spoken by people from a region for which the U.N High Commissioner on Human Rights has declared a level 3 emergency. This law would also apply to areas in the City that are subject to emergency or disaster declarations and also have a concentration of people that do not speak any of the designated citywide languages.",
