  "Summary": "This bill requires the Department of Transportation (DOT), in consultation with the Department for the Aging, to designate certain senior pedestrian zones in the City. DOT must annually install at least one traffic calming device in each zone, and no less than 50 devices across all zones. The Commissioner, after installing at least fifty devices across all zones, may determine to stop further installation in any zone and notify the Speaker of such determination. When any new zone is established or existing zone expanded, DOT shall evaluate the need for any new traffic calming devices in such zones. DOT must report to the Council by February 1, 2024 and annually thereafter on the locations where traffic calming devices have been installed.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the council as follows:\n      Section 1. Subchapter three of chapter 1 of title 19 of the administrative code of the city \n\nof New York is amended by adding a new section 19-183.1 to read as follows:\n \n      \n      � 19-183.1 Installation of traffic calming devices on streets in senior pedestrian zones. a. Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings:\n      Senior pedestrian zone. The term \"senior pedestrian zone\" means a geographic area designated by the commissioner, in consultation with the department for the aging, based on a consideration of factors, including but not limited to, the number of injuries to senior pedestrians in such area each year and the number of older adults residing in such area. \n      Traffic calming device. The term \"traffic calming device\" means a device, including but not limited to street redesigns, speed humps, neckdowns, and raised crosswalks, installed on a street and intended to slow, reduce, or alter motor vehicle traffic to enhance safety for pedestrians and cyclists.\n      b. Each year, the commissioner shall evaluate each senior pedestrian zone for installation of traffic calming devices, install at least one traffic calming device in each senior pedestrian zone, and install no less than 50 traffic calming devices across all senior pedestrian zones. \n      c. Notwithstanding subdivision b of this section, the commissioner shall not be required to install a traffic calming device where such installation would, in the commissioner's judgment, endanger the safety of motorists, pedestrians, or cyclists, or otherwise not be in the public interest.\n      d. After at least 50 traffic calming devices have been installed in total across all senior pedestrian zones, the commissioner may cease installing traffic calming devices in any senior pedestrian zone where the commissioner determines such installation would not meaningfully contribute to the safety of motorists, pedestrians, or cyclists. The commissioner shall inform the speaker of the council in writing of such determination and the reasons therefore, and shall specify the senior pedestrian zone or zones where the installation of traffic calming devices has ceased; provided, however, that the commissioner may continue to install traffic calming devices in senior pedestrian zones after such determination, at the commissioner's discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the department shall evaluate the need to install one or more traffic calming devices in any senior pedestrian zone newly established, or expanded after the date of any such determination. \n      e. On or before February 1, 2024, and annually thereafter, the commissioner shall submit to the speaker of the council a report detailing the locations where a traffic calming device has been installed pursuant to this section during the prior calendar year. The information required by such report may be submitted as part of the update required to be submitted by paragraph 2 of subdivision d of section 19-199.1 of this code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such report shall not be required if the commissioner has determined to cease installation of traffic calming devices in all senior pedestrian zones pursuant to subdivision d of this section.\n      � 2.
