  "Summary": "This bill would require all job centers and SNAP centers to have an expediter on site at all times in which clients are being served or waiting to be served. Expediters would be tasked with checking-in clients, performing a preliminary review of clients’ documents to ensure clients have all necessary documents, and directing clients to the appropriate line or waiting area. This bill would also require all such centers to be equipped with digital displays and an audio amplifier. This bill would also implement a queue management system at every job center and SNAP center. Such system shall allow clients to check-in for each particular service. The system will inform clients how many clients are ahead of them in the queue and the approximate time that they may expect to be called to begin an appointment for each service.",
