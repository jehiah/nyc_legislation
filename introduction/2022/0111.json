  "Summary": "This bill would require that City agencies use methods other than solely virtual methods when carrying out community engagement. However, if an agency determines that the relevant population to be addressed by community engagement does not include anyone with limited internet access, there would be an exception to this requirement that the agency use methods other than solely virtual methods for the community engagement. Agency meetings would be exempt from these requirements until the end of the New York State COVID-19 disaster emergency as declared by Governor Hochul in Executive Order 11 of 2021, as extended.",
