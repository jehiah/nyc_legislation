  "Summary": "This bill would require that all light- and medium-duty vehicles procured by the City after July 1, 2025 be zero emission vehicles such that all light- and medium-duty vehicles in the City’s fleet are zero emission vehicles by July 1, 2035. This bill would also require that all heavy-duty vehicles procured by the City after July 1, 2028 be zero emission vehicles, such that all heavy-duty vehicles in the City’s fleet are zero emission vehicles by July 1, 2038. Further, this bill would require that all motorcycles in the City’s fleet are zero emission vehicles by July 1, 2035. The requirements to procure zero emission vehicles are subject to certain exceptions, such as cost, availability, and lack of charging infrastructure.",
