The pamphlet would describe each topic and provide the name, address, contact information, and website of the relevant agency and community-based organization that an older adult may contact to obtain information to address such topics. The bill would also require such pamphlet to be posted on DFTA’s website and on the 311 website. DFTA would also be required to conduct outreach on the pamphlet and annually report on such outreach efforts.",
