  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation (DOT) to give priority to senior-only housing developments operated by the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA), followed by non-senior only NYCHA developments when determining the order of repairs to be made at sidewalks in front of or abutting properties, when the DOT is required by law or has otherwise undertaken to make these repairs.  This bill would also require DOT to report to the Council and post on the DOT website a report detailing which sidewalks have been repaired and a proposed timeline of sidewalk repairs for NYCHA developments.",
