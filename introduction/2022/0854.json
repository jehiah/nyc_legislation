  "Summary": "The proposed bill would require that the DOT implement daylighting or install daylighting features at a minimum of 100 intersections a year, and must implement daylighting at high priority intersections, those with a significantly larger number of serious vehicular crashes, whenever feasible. The proposed bill also tasks the DOT with publishing information on high priority intersections including their location, whether the department intends to implement daylighting at the intersection, and if not, what if any steps the department intends to take to reduce the incidence of serious vehicular crashes at the intersection.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Subchapter 2 of chapter 1 of title 19 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 19-175.8 to read as follows:\n      � 19-175.8 Daylighting program. a. Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings:\n      Daylighting. The term \"daylighting\" means the prohibition of parking within a minimum of 15 feet of an intersection of city streets.\n      Daylighting feature. The term \"daylighting feature\" means a physical object or installation that prevent vehicles from occupying the space within 15 feet of an intersection of a city street, but does not obstruct visibility, including but not limited to planters or bicycle corrals.\n      High priority intersection. The term \"high priority intersection\" means an intersection determined by the department to have a significantly higher rate of serious vehicular crashes, or significantly higher number of serious vehicular crashes, than the average intersection. \n      Serious vehicular crash. The term \"serious vehicular crash\" means any collision between a motor vehicle and a pedestrian, cyclist, motorist or any other person that results in significant injury to or the death of any person.\n      Significant injury. The term \"significant injury\" means any injury categorized as an \"A\" injury by the New York state department of motor vehicles, or any injury which requires hospitalization, or any other injury as determined by the department.\n      b. Each year, the department shall implement daylighting at a minimum of 100 intersections that do not already have daylighting or daylighting features. If the department eliminates daylighting from any intersection, or removes daylighting features from any intersection, the department shall implement daylighting at an intersection as a replacement for each such intersection from which daylighting or daylighting features were removed.\n      c. The department shall implement daylighting at high priority intersections prior to implementing daylighting at other intersections unless the commissioner determines it is not feasible to do so.\n      d. Whenever the commissioner determines it is feasible, in addition to daylighting an intersection, the department shall install daylighting features within 15 feet of such intersection in order to prevent vehicles from occupying the space. \n      e. The department shall identify all high priority intersections in the city, and shall establish and maintain on its website information regarding such high priority intersections. This information shall include the criteria or threshold used to identify high priority intersections, the location of all high priority intersections, whether the department intends to implement daylighting or install daylighting features at each such intersection, and if not, any changes or features the department intends to implement to reduce the incidence of serious vehicular crashes at such intersection.\n      f. No later than December 1, 2023, and annually thereafter, the commissioner shall submit to the mayor and the speaker of the council a report on its implementation of daylighting and installation of daylighting features, including but not limited to:\n      1. Every intersection, disaggregated by borough, at which the department implemented daylighting or installed daylighting features during the prior year. \n      2. For every intersection at which the department implemented daylighting but did not install daylighting features due to lack of feasibility, an explanation describing why it was not feasible to install such daylighting features.\n      3. Every intersection, disaggregated by borough, at which the department discontinued daylighting or removed daylighting features, and an explanation describing the reason for such discontinuance of daylighting or removal of daylighting features.\n      4. A description of the criteria or threshold used by the department to identify high priority intersections.\n      5. Every high priority intersection, disaggregated by borough, at which the commissioner determined it was not feasible to implement daylighting or install daylighting features and an explanation describing why it was not feasible to do so. For each such intersection, the department shall identify feasible alternative measures that may be implemented in order to reduce the incidence of serious vehicular crashes.\n      � 2.
