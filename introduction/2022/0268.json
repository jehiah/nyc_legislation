Article 207 of chapter 2 of title 28 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 28-207.2.7 to read as follows: \n� 28-207.2.7 Stop work order inspections. The department shall conduct an inspection of a worksite no more than 14 days after the issuance of a stop work order or partial stop work order in order to verify that no work has been performed since the issuance of such stop work order or partial stop work order, and to determine whether the violating condition that gave rise to such stop work order or partial stop work order still exists, where the work: (i) involves demolition of more than 50 percent of such worksite's floor area; (ii) will result in the removal of one or more floors of such worksite; or (iii) is a horizontal or vertical enlargement affecting the exterior envelope of such worksite. Subsequent inspections shall occur every 14 days after such initial inspection, and shall continue until such violating condition has been corrected. Such subsequent inspections shall be conducted jointly by an inspector from the unit that issued the stop work order and inspectors from at least two other units within the department that are related to such violating condition.\n\n      � 2.
