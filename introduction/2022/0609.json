  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to establish a pilot program, in consultation with overdose prevention centers (OPCs) operating in New York City, to offer financial incentives for the return of used needles, syringes, and sharps to overdose prevention centers for their disposal. The program would only be open to individuals who use OPCs for drug consumption. The bill would authorize DOHMH to set the buyback incentive, up to 20 cents per needle, syringe or sharp, with a cap of $10 per individual per day. Once implemented, the program would expire after one year and would require DOHMH to make a recommendation as to whether to make the pilot program permanent and whether to expand it.",
