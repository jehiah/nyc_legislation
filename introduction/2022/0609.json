  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to establish a pilot program to offer financial incentives for the return of needles, syringes, and sharps used for non-medical consumption at locations in the 5 highest-need council districts. The bill would require DOHMH to determine eligibility for participation in the program. The bill would authorize DOHMH to set the buyback incentive, up to 20 cents per needle, syringe or sharp, with a cap of $10 per individual per day. Once implemented, the program would expire after one year and would require DOHMH to submit a report no later than six months after the program has ended that includes the name and locations of all buyback locations, the number of litter returned under the program, by location, the total amount of money disbursed, and a recommendation as to whether to make the pilot program permanent and whether to expand it. The bill would also require DOHMH to create a community-based plan of action to address the opioid epidemic in communities deemed at highest risk for opioid abuse and deaths.",
