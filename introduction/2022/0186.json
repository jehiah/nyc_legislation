(a) It shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice for any creditor or any officer, agent or employee thereof to discriminate in the granting, withholding, extending or renewing, or in the fixing of the rates, terms or conditions of, any form of credit on the basis of an applicant's race, creed, religion, color, national origin, sexual orientation, age, gender, marital status, disability, partnership status, caregiver status, uniformed service or alienage or citizenship status of such applicant or applicants, or because of any lawful source of income of such applicant or applicants, or because children are, may be or would be residing with such applicant or applicants.\n      (b) Notwithstanding paragraph a of this subdivision, it  shall  not  be  considered  discriminatory  if  credit differentiations or decisions are based upon factually supportable, objective differences in applicants' overall credit worthiness, which may include reference to such factors as current income, assets and prior credit history of such applicants, as well as reference to any other relevant factually supportable data; provided, however, that no creditor shall consider, in evaluating the credit worthiness of an applicant, aggregate statistics or assumptions relating to race, creed, religion, color, national origin, sexual orientation, age, gender, marital status, disability, partnership status, caregiver status, uniformed service or alienage or citizenship status of such applicant or applicants, or any lawful source of income of such applicant or applicants, or whether children are, may be or would be residing with such applicant or applicants.\n      (c) Notwithstanding paragraph a of this subdivision, it shall not be an unlawful discriminatory practice to consider age in determining credit worthiness when age has a demonstrable and statistically sound relationship to a determination of credit worthiness.\n      (d) Notwithstanding paragraph a of this subdivision, the provisions in this subdivision, as they relate to age, shall not apply to persons under the age of eighteen years.\n      (e) Notwithstanding paragraph a of this subdivision, it shall not be an unlawful discriminatory practice for a creditor or any officer, agent or employee thereof to make inquiries concerning marital history, status and number of dependents.\n      (f) A creditor granting, withholding, extending or renewing, or fixing the rates, terms or conditions of, any form of credit shall, if requested by an applicant or applicants in writing, disclose the method by which such determinations, rates, terms or conditions were calculated.\n      � 2.

For a period of one year, the commission on human rights shall organize and conduct no fewer than five investigations of discrimination in the granting, withholding, extending or renewing, or in the fixing of the rates, terms or conditions of, any form of credit, during which the commission shall use pairs of testers to investigate creditors. Such investigations shall include but not be limited to using matched pairs of testers who shall apply for, inquire about or express interest in the same extension of credit and who shall be assigned similar credentials but who shall differ in one of the following characteristics: actual or perceived race, creed, religion, color, national origin, sexual orientation, age, gender, marital status, disability, partnership status, caregiver status, uniformed service or alienage or citizenship status of such applicant or applicants, lawful source of income, number of children who are, may be or would be residing with such applicant or applicants.
