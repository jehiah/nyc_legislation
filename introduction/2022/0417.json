  "Summary": "This bill would consolidate the community board and council member notice requirement for bike lanes with the notice process in place for major transportation projects, and would repeal the existing standalone process for bike lanes. This would create a single, uniform, process for the department of transportation to provide notice of major transportation projects and would allow the department to proceed with a project immediately after consideration of recommendations or comments it received during the notice period. This bill would also extend the period of time community boards have to respond to notice of a bike lane major transportation project if notified between June 20 and August 20.",
