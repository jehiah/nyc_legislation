Subdivisions b, c and e of section 20-723.3 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 74 for the year 2009, are amended to read as follows:\n      b. Every distressed property consultant who does business in the city of New York [City] and who advertises distressed property consulting services through the media of a newspaper, magazine, circular, pamphlet, store display, website, e-mail, letter or handbill [and/or] or via a unit or units of advertising space, or through in-person or telephonic solicitation, shall disclose in such advertising or communication, in accordance with the rules established by the commissioner, in plain language in clear and prominent letter type, in a print color that contrasts with the background against which it appears:\n      1. that the city of New York can provide referrals through 311 to community-based organizations that may be able to provide education, information or low-cost or free foreclosure prevention assistance;\n     2. that, pursuant to section 265-b of the New York state real property law, a distressed property consultant is prohibited from:\n     [i.] (a) performing consulting services without a written, fully executed contract with a homeowner;\n     [ii.] (b) charging for or accepting any payment for consulting services before the full completion of all such services, including a payment to be placed in escrow pending the completion of such services;\n     [iii.] (c) taking a power of attorney from a homeowner; [and]\n     [iv.] (d) retaining any original loan document or other original document related to the distressed home loan, the property, or the potential loss of the home for nonpayment of taxes[.];\n       (e) inducing the transfer of a deed to any person or entity, including to the distressed\nproperty consultant;\n      (f) accepting or taking ownership of a deed from a homeowner for any period of \ntime whatsoever;\n      (g) communicating with the homeowner or any member of the homeowner's family or household with such frequency or at such unusual hours or in such a manner as can reasonably be expected to abuse or harass the homeowner;\n      (h) claiming, attempting or threatening to enforce a right with knowledge or reason to know that the right does not exist; \n      (i) using a communication which simulates in any manner legal or judicial process or which gives the appearance of being authorized, issued, or approved by a government, governmental agency, or attorney at law when it is not; and\n      (j) encumbering the property with a lien without any contractual or legal basis.\n      [2.] 3. that hiring a distressed property consultant does not stop the foreclosure process, nor can a distressed property consultant guarantee any particular result with regards to a distressed property[.];\n      4. that hiring a distressed property consultant is not a replacement for hiring independent legal counsel; and\n      5. that there is no obligation to accept assistance from a distressed property consultant.\n      c.
