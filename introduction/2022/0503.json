  "Summary": "This bill would prohibit landlords and building owners from discriminating against rent-regulated and rent-subsidized tenants by limiting access to building entrances, facilities and amenities. This local law would prevent landlords from excluding rent-regulated and rent-subsidized tenants from building facilities and amenities or conditioning access to building facilities and amenities on payment of a fee that market-rate tenants are not also required to pay.",
