  "Summary": "This bill would require the Mayor’s Office for People with Disabilities (MOPD) to establish a program to help high school students with disabilities who are graduating in the current school year obtain accomodations at institutions of higher education. As part of such program, MOPD would (i) develop and implement a system to share information with institutions about students’ special education services and (ii) provide students with student advocates for related supports. This bill would also require MOPD to conduct outreach on the program and to annually submit a report on the program and the outreach to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council and post it on its website.",
