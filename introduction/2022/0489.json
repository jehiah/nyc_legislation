  "Summary": "This bill would require the Mayor to designate an administering agency to create a child care certification program by which building owners that provide space in buildings for child care programs may apply to be recognized as a child care certified building. A certification would be issued upon submission of an application and documentation that a child care program operates in the building and meeting other requirements as determined by the administering agency. The certification would be valid for three years and may be renewed. This bill would also require the administering agency to maintain a database on its website containing a list of the buildings that are certified pursuant to the program.",
