  "Summary": "This bill would require the operator of a place of entertainment to disclose the full price of a ticket whenever they display a ticket price on advertisements. The advertised price would be required to include fees such as taxes and service fees to increase transparency. By requiring early disclosure, this bill would allow consumers to make more informed decisions before beginning a transaction.",
