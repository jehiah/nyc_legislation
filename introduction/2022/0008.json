  "Summary": "This bill would require the operator of a place of entertainment or its agent to disclose service fees, along with the price of a ticket on advertising and promotional materials. Further, the bill would require operators or agents to disclose what portion of the total ticket price the service fee represents. Currently, operators or agents regularly conceal these fees until the final stages of a transaction. By requiring early disclosure, this bill would allow consumers to make more informed decisions before beginning a transaction.",
