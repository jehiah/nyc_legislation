  "Summary": "This proposed legislation would require that the mayor create an Office of Marine Debris Disposal and Vessel Surrendering. The office would be responsible for, among other things, coordinating the disposal of, or if appropriate, reuse marine debris left on public beaches, and developing a program to encourage boat owners to dispose of boats through the city rather than abandon them in the water.",
