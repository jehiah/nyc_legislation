  "Summary": "This bill would strengthen existing protections for immigrant small business owners, some of whom may have limited English proficiency. First, the bill would clarify and strengthen protections outlined in the Business Owner’s Bill of Rights and the Food Service Establishment Code of Conduct.  It would also enhance the oversight and reporting duties of the Food Service Establishment Inspection Ombuds Office.  Additionally, the bill would require the Department of Small Business Services (SBS) to work with all of the city agencies that inspect small businesses to increase the number of bi- and multi-lingual inspectors so that by July 1, 2024 a small business owner may request a bilingual inspector for all inspections.  Finally, the bill would require that by March 1, 2023, SBS and the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings (OATH) develop and implement a plan by that would provide a small business owner with a written translation of OATH’s final decision at the time such decision is issued.  The translation must include a disclaimer stating that it is strictly an informational document and that nothing within the translated text can be construed to create a cause of action or a defense in legal proceedings.",
