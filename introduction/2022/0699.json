The bill would clarify and strengthen protections outlined in the Business Owner’s Bill of Rights and the Food Service Establishment Code of Conduct, including by requiring the Bill of Rights and Code of Conduct to be translated into additional languages. In addition, the bill would require certain city agencies that regularly conduct inspections to report annually on the number of bilingual inspectors they employ and the languages spoken by those inspectors. Furthermore, the bill would require the Hearings Division of the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings to translate its written decisions upon request.",
