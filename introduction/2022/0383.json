  "Summary": "This bill would change the timeline requiring that when there is a new vacancy or change of ownership in commercial premises that requires filing a new registration statement, such supplemental registration statement must be filed 1) at the same time as the registration statement, if the change or vacancy occurs from January 1 to May 31 and 2) within 60 days of the change or vacancy if it occurs from June 1 to December 31. In addition, it would require that, for each commercial premises required to file a registration statement, the public dataset would include whether it is vacant, leased or owner-occupied and, if vacant, the expiration date of the most recent lease.",
