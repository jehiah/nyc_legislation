  "Summary": "This bill would add an optional question to the PASSPort questionnaire asking prospective city venders to voluntarily disclose the gender and race of their directors and senior executives. This data would be available for general informational purposes and to help inform future policymaking, as state law limits the information the City may consider in awarding contracts.",
