  "Summary": "This bill would amend the existing Pay Equity Law, LL 18 of 2019, by requiring the Department of Citywide Administrative Services to provide new categories of information to the Council for each City employee with respect to the reporting of employment data. This bill also expands the definition of agency to capture more of the City workforce, including pedagogues of the Department of Education. Finally, this bill will also provide the Council to pay and employment data year-round so the Council can analyze the data at its discretion and provide more robust oversight over the Administration in attempting to identify and mitigate instances of pay disparities in the City workforce.",
