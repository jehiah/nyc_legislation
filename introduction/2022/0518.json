  "Summary": "This bill would require the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice to coordinate with the New York City Police Department to conduct a study and issue an annual report to the Mayor and City Council Speaker on the trafficking of illegal firearms into New York City. Such report would be required to include information on each firearm seized or surrendered to the Police Department; such at the date and location the firearm was seized, the type of firearm, whether the firearm was connected to a crime, and other information relevant to tracking that trafficking of illegal firearms. Additionally, the study and report would include a review of the ways firearms are illegally transported into New York City; and recommendations on how municipalities, states and the federal government can better collaborate to prevent the transportation of illegal firearms; and other recommendation on efforts to reduce gun violence.",
