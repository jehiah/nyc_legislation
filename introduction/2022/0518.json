  "Summary": "This bill would require the Mayor’s Office to Prevent Gun Violence to coordinate with the Police Department to conduct a study and submit a report on the illegal transportation of firearms. The study and report would need to identify the locations where firearms have been seized or surrendered in the City, and specifically the locations where firearms that have been connected to a crime have been seized or surrendered in the City, including the type of firearm, the manufacturer of the firearm, and whether the firearm is a ghost gun or 3-D printed firearm. The study and report would also need to identify the ways states and municipalities coordinate to prevent the illegal transportation of firearms, recommendations for states and municipalities to increase collaboration to prevent the illegal transportation of firearms, and recommendations for federal, state and municipal policies to prevent the illegal transportation of firearms.",
