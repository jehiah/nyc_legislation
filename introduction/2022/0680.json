  "Summary": "This local law would require an agency or office designated by the mayor, in consultation with the Department of Environmental Protection, the Department of Parks and Recreation, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Citywide Administrative Services and any other appropriate agency, to review sites, owned by the city of New York in residential zones in each borough, on streets with dead ends and vacant land in close proximity to such streets, and land that abuts highway entrances, underpasses and exits, that are suitable for the planting of trees or other vegetation, or for establishing bioswales, small parks or other green spaces.. The survey would prioritize sites located in environmental justice communities. The survey would have to be submitted to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council by April, 1 2024, and would include an analysis of the condition of each surveyed site, as well as the feasibility of planting trees or other vegetation or the installation of bioswales, small parks or other green spaces, a description of the necessary steps associated with installing these features, as well as an estimate of the length of time and the overall cost to do so for each site.",
