  "Summary": "This local law would require the department of transportation, in conjunction with the department of environmental protection and the department of parks and recreation to conduct a survey of streets with dead ends located in residential zones in each borough, parcels of vacant land owned by the city and land that abuts highway entrance and exit ramps that are suitable for the planting of trees or other vegetation. The survey would have to be submitted to the Mayor and Council by July, 1 2023, and it would have to determine which dead ends and highway entrance and exit ramps can be converted into a bioswale or other green space that would support the planting of trees or other vegetation. The City would then be required to plant trees and other vegetation in those dead ends and highway entrance and exit ramps by July 1, 2027.",
