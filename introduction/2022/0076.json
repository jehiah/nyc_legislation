  "Summary": "This bill would require that the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) establish a financial assistance program to reduce the costs of purchasing and installing backwater valves. This bill would also require that DEP, in consultation with other agencies or offices as designated by the Mayor, complete a study that evaluates where backwater valves should be installed to mitigate damage caused by backflow. The study would be posted on the DEP website and submitted to the Mayor and Speaker of the Council.  The financial assistance program would be informed by the findings of such study and subject to appropriation.  This bill would also require DEP to prioritize neighborhoods regularly affected by backflow events and conduct outreach and education to property owners about the benefits of backwater valves.",
