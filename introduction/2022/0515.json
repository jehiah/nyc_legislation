  "Summary": "This bill would require that the agencies include an analysis of compensation data and measures to address pay disparity and occupational segregation, diversity and inclusion training, schedule and workplace accommodations and access to facilities-including for individuals with disabilities, gender appropriate bathrooms and lactation rooms-in their affirmative employment plans. The head of each agency would also be required to submit an annual report on the number of new full-time and part-time employees retained, promoted, terminated, or that resigned and their compensation. Finally, the bill would require the Equal Employment Practices Commission to conduct a comparable worth analysis annually and submit its findings to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council. The comparable worth analysis would analyze compensation within agencies and across different agencies.",
