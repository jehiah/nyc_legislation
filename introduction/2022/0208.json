  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) to establish rules to select 300 multiple dwellings, in consultation with the Fire Department (FDNY), to be inspected for self-closing door compliance. It would require HPD to submit an annual report with information about these inspections. This bill would also require HPD to provide information to FDNY regarding fire safety violations dating back to 2017, which FDNY must audit to inform its building inspection program.",
