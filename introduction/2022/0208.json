  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) to inspect self-closing doors in a building’s common areas at least once every two years. It would require HPD to notify the building owner immediately of any self-closing door violation, and requires that a building owner immediately take action to correct such violation. If such inspection reveals any immediately hazardous violation, HPD would conduct a re-inspection of the building after the building owner notifies HPD that such violation has been corrected or after 90 days since the agency identified the violation, whichever occurs first. Where a tenant or occupant of a residential building requests an inspection for an alleged violation, this bill would require that HPD inspect the immediate floor for self-closing door violations. If HPD discovers a violation, the agency would inspect all other common areas in such building to confirm any additional self-closing door violations.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Article 11 of subchapter 2 of chapter 2 of title 27 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 27-2041.2 to read as follows:\n      � 27-2041.2 Self-closing doors; required inspections. a. General. Commencing January 1, 2023, self-closing doors in occupancy groups R-1 and R-2 shall be periodically inspected in accordance with this section.\n      Exception: No inspection is required pursuant to this section for a building that contains no self-closing doors and for which the owner of such building has submitted to the commissioner, in a form and manner determined by the commissioner, a certificate of a registered design professional, or a person satisfying other qualifications that the commissioner may establish, that such building contains no self-closing doors and is not required by law to contain self-closing doors.\n      b. Inspection intervals. The department shall conduct an inspection of a building's self-closing doors at periodic intervals as set forth by rule of the commissioner, but such inspection shall be conducted at least once every two years.\n      Exception: The initial inspection for a new building shall be conducted in the third year after the earlier of (i) the issuance by the department of a letter of completion or, if applicable, a temporary or final certificate of occupancy for such building or (ii) the date such building was completed as determined by reference to an applicable rule of the department.\n      c. Inspection process. Self-closing doors shall be inspected and tested in accordance with this section and applicable rules of the department promulgated pursuant to this section. The commissioner shall develop criteria to be used during the inspection of a self-closing door for violations.\n      d. Inspection requirements. At each inspection conducted pursuant to subdivision c, the department shall, at minimum, inspect self-closing doors in common areas, public spaces, hallways and corridors, provided that such testing need only include common areas, public spaces, hallways, and corridors on floors that contain self-closing doors. \n      e. Notification and correction of violations. If an inspection reveals any violation, the department shall notify the building owner immediately and the building owner shall immediately correct such violating condition and bring such condition into compliance with applicable provisions of this code, the New York city fire code and the New York city construction codes. The building owner shall certify to the department in a time and manner determined by the commissioner that such condition has been corrected.\n      f. Re-inspection requirement. If an inspection of self-closing doors conducted pursuant to this section reveals any class C immediately hazardous violation, the department shall conduct a re-inspection of the building after receiving notification from the building owner that such violation has been corrected or after 90 days have passed since any such violation was identified to the building owner, whichever occurs first.\n      g. Conditional inspections. Where a tenant or occupant of an R-1 or R-2 occupancy group building requests an inspection for an alleged violation identified in such building's common areas, public spaces, hallways, or corridors, the department shall automatically inspect the immediate floor of such alleged violation for self-closing door violations if such floor contains self-closing doors. If the department discovers a self-closing door violation on such immediate floor, the department shall inspect all other common areas, public spaces, hallways and corridors in such building for self-closing door violations.\n      h. Annual report on self-closing doors. 1. No later than December 31, 2023, and annually thereafter, the commissioner shall submit to the mayor and the speaker of the council and shall post conspicuously on the department's website an annual report regarding self-closing doors inspected by the department pursuant to this section.\n      2. The annual report shall include a table in which each separate row references a building inspected by the department pursuant to this section in the previous year. Each such row shall include the following information, as well as any additional information the commissioner deems appropriate, set forth in separate columns:\n      (a) The address of the building where such inspection occurred;\n      (b) The building or property owner;\n      (c) The date on which an inspection of such building occurred;\n      (d) The number of floors contained in such building;\n      (e) Which floors were inspected for self-closing door violations in the previous year;\n      (f) The number of self-closing doors inspected in such building in the previous year;\n      (g) The number of self-closing door violations identified in such building in the previous year; and\n      (h) The date on which the property owner properly corrected all self-closing door violations after any such violations were identified by the department during such inspection.\n      � 2.
