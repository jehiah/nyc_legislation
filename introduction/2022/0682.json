  "Summary": "The proposed bill would require the Mayor’s Office for People with Disabilities (MOPD) to consult with each agency to develop and implement a five-year accessibility plan, to include, at minimum: (1) the steps the agency is taking and will be taking over the next 5 years to ensure accessibility to the agency’s workplace, services, and programs, and (2) information on ongoing projects and projects planned over the next 5 years related to improving physical, digital and programmatic access, and effective communications for persons with disabilities. MOPD would also be required to invite the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) to develop and submit a five-year accessibility plan. The proposed bill would require each agency to post a proposed version of their five-year accessibility plan on their website and to circulate it for public comment. The proposed bill would further require interim reporting on each agency’s progress towards accessibility until the deadline for posting the five-year accessibility plans to the respective agencies’ websites on March 15, 2024. Lastly, the proposed bill would require MOPD to conduct outreach to any agency or entity (including the MTA) to share best practices regarding accessibility. If any such agency or entity does not develop a five-year accessibility plan within 90 days of such meeting, MOPD would be required to post on its website a statement that the agency or entity failed to develop such plan, and include a summary of best practices shared with the agency or entity.",
