  "Summary": "This bill would require the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene to develop a campaign to increase low-wage workers’ awareness of and enrollment in health insurance. In establishing this campaign, the Commissioner would work with the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs, and other relevant agencies. The Commissioner would communicate with low-wage workers, industries and stakeholders about the barriers such workers face in obtaining health insurance and develop strategies and materials to enhance health insurance awareness and increase enrollment. The bill would also require the Commissioner to report annually on the campaign to the Mayor and Speaker of the Council and post such report on the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene website.",
