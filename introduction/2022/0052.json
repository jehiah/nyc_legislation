  "Summary": "Curb heights sometimes are not adequately maintained during street construction and, as a result, flooding of property has occurred. Property owners have subsequently been fined for having ponding conditions on their property. This bill would require that the Department of Transportation ensure that adequate curb heights are maintained following construction in order to prevent flooding and fines for ponding conditions that are not the fault of property owners.",
