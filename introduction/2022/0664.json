Chapter 2 of title 12 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 12-214 to read as follows:\n      � 12-214 Donation of surplus computer equipment. a. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms have the following meanings:\n      Beneficial use. The term \"beneficial use\" means the use of equipment by an eligible organization for an educational or other public purpose, provided that such organization has a demonstrated need for such equipment; and provided further that such use shall not include religious worship, instruction, or proselytization.\n      Computer. The term \"computer\" means a desktop computing device, a laptop, or other portable computing device, containing a central processing unit and any peripheral components that are connected to the central processing unit such that they may reasonably be viewed functionally as a single unit, including but not limited to motherboards, RAM, hard drives, or other storage devices, video or sound cards, and computer cases.\n      Department. The term \"department\" means the department of citywide administrative services.\n      Eligible organization. The term \"eligible organization\" means a public school, public library, other public or private educational institution, and a not-for-profit institution serving persons with disabilities, senior citizens, or low income individuals.\n      Equipment. The term \"equipment\" means a computer and its associated peripheral components, and other electronic devices that operate with or can be operated by a computer, including but not limited to floppy disk drives, CD drives, USB drives, printers, modems, networking devices, scanners, monitors, and the cables or wiring required to connect a computer with the computer equipment.\n      Surplus. The term \"surplus\" means equipment that is no longer in use, and not needed for use, by any agency. \n      b. The department shall, by rule, implement a process through which the department shall donate, at no cost except for any reasonable shipping and handling fees, surplus equipment to eligible organizations for beneficial use. Such process shall include, at a minimum:\n      1. Public notification of the department's intent to donate surplus equipment, a description of such surplus equipment, and the total shipping and handling fees, if any, for the delivery of such equipment; and\n      2. The opportunity for eligible organizations to submit to the department a specific plan for the beneficial use of such equipment.\n      c. The department shall not donate surplus equipment to an eligible organization unless such organization provides to such department a specific plan for the beneficial use of such surplus equipment. The department shall specify, by rule, how to determine priority when multiple eligible organizations provide such specific plan for the beneficial use of such equipment, except that public schools and libraries shall receive first priority. Such rule shall require consideration of the following factors:\n      1. Whether the beneficial use of such equipment facilitates services to the public for low or no cost; \n      2. Whether the beneficial use of such equipment will serve communities that are under-serviced or have difficulty receiving services; \n      3. In the event that an eligible organization has previously received a donation of surplus equipment, whether such organization has utilized such equipment to fulfill the beneficial use for which it was donated; \n      4. Whether an eligible organization has a greater need for a donation of surplus equipment due to its limited size as compared to other eligible organizations; and\n      5. Any other factor that the department deems relevant.\n      d.
