  "Summary": "The proposed bill would require all schools in the City to maintain lead levels below a water lead action level to be established by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) in all drinking water or water used for cooking. All schools would be required to test water used for drinking or cooking at least once a year, and provide the results of this analysis to the parent or guardian of each child that attends such facility. If results indicate a lead level above the level to be established by DOHMH, such facilities would be required to install water filtration or treatment systems to reduce lead concentrations in water, or to use other means to supply safe drinking and cooking water to occupants of such facilities.",
