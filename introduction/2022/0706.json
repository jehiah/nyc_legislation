  "Summary": "This bill would require the Mayor’s Office of Community Mental Health (OCMH) to maintain on its website access to a public, searchable online database of mental health services provided in New York City. To make the database more accessible and user-friendly to the public, OCMH would be required to indicate on its website that the services are searchable by subcategory, e.g. inpatient care, outpatient care, and substance use services. OCMH would also be required to indicate that the database lists the contact information of listed mental health services providers, as well as the type of services provided, payment information (including the type of insurance accepted), whether services are provided in person or remotely, whether services are provided by peers, and whether services are accessible to persons with disabilities. OCMH would also be required to coordinate with the providers of such services to conduct culturally competent outreach on how to access and use the online database.",
