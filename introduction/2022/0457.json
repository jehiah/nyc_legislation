  "Summary": "This bill would exempt New York City agencies from take-off and landing restrictions that operate to significantly restrict the permissible use of small drones in the City, for the purposes of using drones to carry out agency functions and duties. No employee or agent of a City agency would be permitted to use drones to carry out agency functions or duties before the head of such agency makes rules authorizing the use of drones by such agency, and such use would be subject to all other applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations.",
