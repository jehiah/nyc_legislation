  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection to engage in an outreach and education campaign. The purpose of the campaign would be to raise public awareness of services that are often provided for a fee by businesses but can also be obtained for free from the city government. In particular, the campaign would focus on outreach and education about services that provide assistance in applying for government benefits. It would also require reporting on the outreach and education campaign, including the neighborhoods where it was implemented, and the languages and methods used.",
