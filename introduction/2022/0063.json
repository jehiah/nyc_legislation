  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Legislative intent. As New York City works to reform its draconian and racially discriminatory criminal justice system, such work must include a review of the public markers that need to change to align with present day principles. One such opportunity is Rikers Island. The name has historic ties to slavery, and the correctional facility has a reputation for the abuse and neglect of incarcerated individuals. Accordingly, following the mayoral advisory commission on city art, monuments and markers, the Council proposes a commission to rename Rikers Island. This commission will meet formally and may solicit public input.\n      � 2. Commission to rename Rikers Island. a.
