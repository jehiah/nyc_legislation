  "Summary": "This bill would require the Administration for Children’s Services (ACS) to establish a child care program fund to award grants to child care programs in the City. To be eligible for a grant, a child care program would have to be experiencing a significant risk of closure or displacement, in addition to meeting other requirements as determined by ACS. ACS would be permitted to award grants of $1,000 per full-time employee of a child care program, up to a maximum of 20 employees. This bill would also require ACS to submit an annual report to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council on grants awarded to child care programs in the preceding fiscal year, and would require ACS to publish on its website information on child care grants, including eligibility, instructions for the application process, and required documentation.",
