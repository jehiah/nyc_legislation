  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Sanitation (DSNY) to equip street sweepers with global positioning system technology and ensure that such technology is functioning during street cleaning operations. The bill would also require DSNY to publish and maintain a page on its website that allows the public to track and confirm the completion of street cleanings, using data from global positioning system devices installed on street sweepers. This bill would also require DSNY to submit biannual reports on street cleanings to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council and post the reports on its website.",
