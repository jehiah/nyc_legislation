This bill would also require DSNY to submit biannual reports for two years on street cleanings to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council and post the reports on the DSNY website.",

The term \"global positioning system\" or \"GPS\" means the global positioning system, or a comparable location tracking technology, that uses navigational satellites to determine a location in real time and is capable of collecting, storing and transmitting geographical data.\n      Street sweeper.
