  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to develop a plan to prevent the spread of monkeypox in response to the ongoing monkeypox outbreak. DOHMH would be required to conduct an education and outreach campaign about the monkeypox outbreak, including transmission, prevention of infection, and vaccination and treatment. DOHMH would also be required to coordinate with agencies and community organizations to ensure that communities most at risk of contracting the virus and communities with low vaccine accessibility have adequate vaccine access. DOHMH would evaluate the demographics of monkeypox vaccine recipients, and adjust the hours of operation and location of vaccination sites based on such examination and the needs of communities most at risk of contracting the disease. The bill would also require DOHMH to maintain a vaccine portal that allows individuals to schedule appointments for COVID-19, monkeypox and other infectious disease vaccinations.",
