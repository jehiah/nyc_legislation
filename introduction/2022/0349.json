  "Summary": "This legislation would require the Department of Correction to screen and offer evidence-based interventions to individuals between 18 and 21 years old in custody who self-report that they do not have a high school diploma or its equivalent for dyslexia immediately. This mandate to offer screening and evidence-based intervention for dyslexia would expand to the entire jail population by December 31, 2025. The department must also coordinate with the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice and city-contracted programs that serve justice-involved individuals to provide dyslexia interventions after individuals are released from custody. On a quarterly basis, the department must issue public reports on how many individuals, disaggregated by age and zip code, are being screened for dyslexia and enrolling in available programming.",
