  "Summary": "This bill would reduce the amount of time for a landlord to correct a violation to keep or maintain self-closing doors from 21 days to 14 days. Once the 14 day window has run, it also requires inspection by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development within 20 days, regardless of whether the owner has submitted a certification of correction. It establishes a civil penalty range of $250-$500 for violation of the self-closing door requirement. It would also increase civil penalties for false certification of correction of class B and class C violations of the Housing Maintenance Code. Finally, this bill would clarify that all doors providing access to interior corridors or stairs in R-1 and R-2 occupancy groups must be self-closing or equipped with a device that will ensure such doors close shut and are latched.",
