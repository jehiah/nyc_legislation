  "Summary": "This bill would reduce the amount of time for a landlord to correct a violation to keep or maintain self-closing doors from 21 days to 10 days. Once the 10 day window has run, it also requires inspection by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development within 14 days, regardless of whether the owner has submitted a certification of correction. It would also increase civil penalties for willful false certification by landlords of completed repairs and for Class C Housing Maintenance Code violations, also known as immediately hazardous violations. Finally, this bill would clarify that all doors providing access to interior corridors or stairs in R-1 and R-2 occupancy groups must be self-closing or equipped with a device that will ensure such doors close shut and are latched.",
