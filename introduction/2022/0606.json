  "Summary": "This bill would amend the idling law to restrict idling to one minute when adjacent to or within parks that have a designated name and are identified as a park on the Department of Parks and Recreation’s website. This bill would also create an affirmative defense that the park was not easily identifiable as a park by signage or otherwise at the time a violation occurred.",
