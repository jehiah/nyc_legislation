  "Summary": "This bill would require owners of large commercial buildings that are over 500,000 gross square feet in size to produce and submit a delivery and servicing plan to the Department of Buildings (“DOB”), and to implement truck traffic mitigation interventions. The delivery and servicing plan would describe sustainability-focused efforts the building would take to reduce the total number of delivery and service trips to the site, including through delivery consolidation, off-peak deliveries and reservation systems, and providing access to loading docks and package storage facilities. The bill would also create an office of sustainable delivery systems within DOB, tasked with overseeing plan implementation and providing technical assistance to building owners developing delivery and service plans.",
