  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (“DOHMH”) to submit to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council, and make publicly available on DOHMH’s website, a semiannual report on the number of objections filed by multiple dwelling owners to DOHMH lead abatement orders. The report would be required to include the number of objections filed by the New York City Housing Authority and to specify the reasons why any objections are found to have merit, including faulty testing or paint sampling, or an exemption based on the dwelling’s construction date.",
