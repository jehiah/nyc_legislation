  "Summary": "This bill would establish a Child Care Advisory Board (“board”), which would be responsible for conducting studies on and issuing reports related to child care in the city, including, but not limited to, providing an annual assessment of the needs of child care programs in the city and the City’s progress towards providing universal child care. The board would also make recommendations to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council on legislation, regulation, policies, procedures and initiatives to help to make child care more affordable based on such assessments. The board would submit an annual report that includes its assessment of the needs of child care programs across the city and recommendations on how to improve child care and make it more affordable, including, but not limited to, any challenges child care programs face in providing quality child care; the City’s advancement towards universal child care, including any actions taken by City agencies or legislation or policies introduced; the projected annual costs for the next five years associated with implementing universal child care; and costs associated with expanding child care subsidies to families whose income equals up to 300% and 400% of the federal poverty guidelines. The board would be required to meet quarterly, and its meetings would be open to the public. The board would be comprised of the heads of the following agencies and offices, or their designees: the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, the Administration for Children’s Services, and the Department of Education. The board would additionally include, but not be limited to, one member appointed by the Mayor, one member appointed by the Speaker, one member appointed by the Comptroller, and one member appointed by the Public Advocate. The Mayor would designate one member to serve as chair of the board.",
