  "Summary": "The bill would require the New York Police Department (NYPD) to report annually on the number of officers who resign prior to becoming eligible for retirement with pension in the preceding year.  Additionally, the NYPD must report on the reason for resignation, including whether the officer resigned in order to join the fire department, a different police force, or another government agency. The data will be disaggregated by the duration of employment at the NYPD.",
