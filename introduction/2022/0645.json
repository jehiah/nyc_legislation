  "Summary": "This bill would require the Commissioner of Citywide Administrative Services to collaborate with the Commissioner of Correction to administer civil service examinations for individuals incarcerated for a period of 10 days or longer in Borough-Based Jails. This bill would authorize the Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) to waive the examination fee for any individual who sits for a civil service examination while incarcerated, or within the year following their release from the custody of the Department of Correction (DOC). Additionally, this bill would require DCAS and DOC, including the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice, to coordinate in administering informational programming about the civil service examination system to justice-involved individuals. Finally, this bill would require annual reporting in relation to participation among justice-involved individuals in civil service examinations and related programming.",
