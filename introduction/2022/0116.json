  "Summary": "This bill would require the Commissioner of Small Business Services (“SBS”) to create a “One-Stop Shop NYC Business Portal,” through which with all applications, permits, licenses, and related information needed to open and operate a small business in the City would be available in a single, easily accessible, and easy-to-navigate location on the SBS website, as well as via a mobile application. A user could submit and check on the status of applications, permits, and licenses through this portal. Before creating the portal, the Commissioner would be required to consult with the heads of other City agencies who oversee requirements related to small businesses, in order to conduct a review of all such applications, permits, licenses, and related information, as well as the processes and procedures used by individuals in interacting with City agencies in opening and operating a small business. The Commissioner and other agency heads would consider ways that such processes and procedures can be facilitated and made more efficient through the use of the One-Stop Shop NYC Business portal, with the goal of devising methods to assist small businesses in moving through application and permit processes more quickly and easily. The Commissioner also would be required to review annually the effectiveness and efficiency of the One-Stop Shop NYC Business Portal, to carry out improvements to facilitate its use, and to report on such improvements to the Mayor and the Council.",
