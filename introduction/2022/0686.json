  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Youth and Community Development (DYCD) to operate a summer youth employment program (SYEP). DYCD would coordinate with other agencies to develop summer youth employment opportunities. Each agency would have a goal of accepting SYEP participants equal to at least .5 percent of its total full-time headcount. DYCD would also coordinate with the Department of Small Business Services (SBS) to promote SYEP to businesses with which SBS has contact. DYCD would submit an annual report including the number of youth employed pursuant to SYEP each year, disaggregated by placement in each of the government, private, and nonprofit sectors. For the government sector, the report would disaggregate the number of youth employed by each agency. For any agency that does not meet the goal of employing at least .5 percent of its total full-time headcount, the report would include an explanation of why the goal was not met.",
