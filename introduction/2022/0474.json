  "Summary": "This bill would require the city to conduct a public education program to inform the public about the protections available to people and providers accessing reproductive health care facilities. It would also be required to provide information about the protections available in the City Human Rights Law (HRL) related to reproductive health decisions and stopping discriminatory harassment. The public education program would also provide information about a person’s right to bring a civil action for violating the HRL and the access to reproductive health care facilities law, as well as how to access resources to find comprehensive reproductive health care and privacy protections for people accessing reproductive health care.",
