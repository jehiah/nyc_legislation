  "Summary": "This bill would require the City Commission on Human Rights (CCHR) to conduct an outreach campaign to inform the public about the protections available to people and providers accessing reproductive health care facilities. CCHR would also be required to provide information in the city designated languages about the protections available in the City Human Rights Law (HRL) related to reproductive health decisions and stopping discriminatory harassment. The Commission would also provide information about a person’s right to bring a civil action for violating the HRL and the access to reproductive health care facilities law.",
