Human service contracts include but are not limited to day care, foster care, home care, health or medical services, housing and shelter assistance, preventive services, youth services, the operation of senior centers, employment training and assistance, vocational and educational programs, legal services and recreation programs. The bill exempts building service employees and subcontractors whose principal purpose is to provide supplies, or administrative services, technical support or other similar services that do not directly relate to the performance of human services. No later than 90 days after the award or renewal of a human services contract, the contractor would be obligated to submit an attestation that 1) the employer has entered into one or more labor peace agreements with a labor organization, or 2) no labor organization has sought to represent their employees. Such attestation shall be updated annually.",
