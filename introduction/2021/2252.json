No later than 90 days after the award or renewal of a human services contract, the contractor would be obligated to submit an attestation that 1) the employer has entered into one or more labor peace agreements with a labor organization, or 2) no labor organization has sought to represent their employees. Such attestation shall be updated annually.",
