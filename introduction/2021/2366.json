  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR) to conduct risk and health inspections of every street tree under its jurisdiction that has a caliper size greater than 6 inches at least once between each tree’s pruning cycles. DPR would be required to publicly post the criteria that it utilizes to inspect such trees and submit an annual report on how many trees are referred for inspection each year, how many are actually inspected each year and the results of such inspections. Finally, DPR would be required to maintain a regularly updated map on its website that displays each tree that was inspected, the result of such inspection and the action taken by the DPR in response to the result of such inspection.",
