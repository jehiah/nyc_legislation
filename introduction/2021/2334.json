  "Summary": "This bill would prohibit third-party food delivery services, entities that provide restaurants with online order and delivery services, from making changes to orders, including the amount a customer is charged or the amount a restaurant will receive, without first consulting the restaurant fulfilling the order. Before a third-party food delivery service makes a change to an order it would first inform the restaurant, then the customer. Additionally, this bill would prohibit third-party food delivery services from charging restaurants more than 50% of the cost of refunding an aggrieved customer for an order unless the customer’s complaint is unrelated to services provided by the third-party delivery business. Failure to comply would result in civil penalties.",
