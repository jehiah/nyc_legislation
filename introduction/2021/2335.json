  "Summary": "Some third-party food delivery services generate and advertise unique telephone numbers for the food service establishments with which they contract, and collect a fee when customers use that unique telephone number for food or beverage orders from the establishments. This bill would require these services, if listing any telephone number for an establishment, to include that establishment’s direct telephone number, and if also including a unique telephone number, to provide a description of the telephone numbers. The description must identify each type of telephone number and any fees associated with their use. The Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection would be required to promulgate rules defining the content, size and location of the description.",
