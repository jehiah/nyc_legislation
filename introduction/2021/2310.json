  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation and the Department of Parks and Recreation to submit a joint report to the Mayor and to the Speaker of the City Council, identifying at least one location in each New York City zip code suitable for installing a public bathroom. The Department of Transportation and Department of Parks and Recreation would need to consult with community boards and the public when considering the locations for installing a public bathroom. The report would also need to include the factors the agencies considered when choosing the locations for installing public bathrooms, costs and challenges associated with installing public bathrooms, and recommendations for installing public bathrooms and implementing any necessary safety measures for each location identified in the report to address any challenges associated with such installation.",
