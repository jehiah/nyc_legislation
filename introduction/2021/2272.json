  "Summary": "This bill would require the City’s Director of Environmentally Preferable Purchasing to report details on the supply chain and source of agency-purchased textile goods. Additionally, this bill would establish a task force to identify and assess agency needs for textile goods, and to make recommendations for purchasing such goods in an environmentally preferable manner. Finally, the task force would be required to identify other costs associated with city textile consumption, including the health and safety effects on laborers in the supply chain and the communities in which textile goods are produced, processed and manufactured.",
