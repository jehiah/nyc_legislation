  "Summary": "This bill would change the community board notification process for major transportation projects by defining the construction or removal of a bus lane, busway, or bike lane as a major transportation project, regardless of the number of consecutive blocks or consecutive feet of street that the project alters. This bill would also require the Department of Transportation (DOT) to affirmatively offer a presentation of any such project plan to affected community boards, and would give community boards sixty days following DOT’s presentation of any such project plan to provide recommendations or comments on such plan. Finally, this bill would require DOT to post quarterly progress reports on its website for any proposed major transportation project or installation or removal of a bus lane, busway or bike lane.",
