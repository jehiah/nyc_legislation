  "Summary": "This bill would require all third-party food delivery services that serve at least 20 different establishments with different owners or operators to provide estimated times of arrival for all their deliveries. It also would require them to provide an anticipated delivery time that will be expressed in a range of at least five minutes before and after the estimated time of arrival. If the estimated delivery time changes for any reason, the food delivery service must update the customer with a new estimated time of arrival and window of anticipated delivery time that references the original timeframe given. Finally, the bill would require that food delivery apps explicitly state that they are responsible for the delivery once the order leaves the restaurant. A violation would be subject to a civil penalty of $500 for each instance.",
