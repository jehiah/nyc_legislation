  "Summary": "This bill would apply to a contractor and a City agency or the Council that are parties to a City contract valued in excess of $100,000. It would require the City Chief Procurement Officer (CCPO) to establish standards and procedures for a contractor to use to determine the existence of a conflict of interest and certain misconduct concerning the contract on the part of its officers or employees and those of its subcontractors. The Mayor’s Office of Contract Services (MOCS) would have to require the agency or Council as party to a contract to include such standards and procedures in the contract. The contractor would be required to submit a certification of compliance with such standards and procedures, as well as that no conflict of interest or misconduct exists, to MOCS. Finally, the bill would require the CCPO to report on certifications submitted by contractors.",
