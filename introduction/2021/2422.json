  "Summary": "This bill would authorize the use of pay-by-plate parking meters in addition to pay-and-display parking meters.  Pay-by-plate parking meters would require a person to enter the vehicle’s license plate to register payment for parking, and would be capable of tracking payment by the vehicle’s license plate, rather than by paper receipt.  Before the Department of Transportation (DOT) makes changes to the parking meter rates or replaces a pay-and-display parking meter with a pay-by-plate parking meter, DOT would provide 30-days written notice to the Council Member and Community Board in whose district such change would occur and post such change on the DOT’s website.  Additionally, parking time could only be used on the blockface, or street section, for which it was purchased and could not be transferred between blockfaces.  This bill would also consolidate existing sections of the Administrative Code related to parking meters into one section.",
