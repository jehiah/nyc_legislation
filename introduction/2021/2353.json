In addition, notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of this chapter, including the provisions of section 16-503, if the commission inquires in writing of a labor union or labor organization that represents employees involved in the collection, removal, transportation or disposal of trade waste as to whether that labor union or labor organization represents employees at any company that collects, removes, transports or disposes of putrescible trade waste, such labor union or labor organization must respond to the commission within 30 days in a sworn, written statement, and, if the labor union or labor organization represents employees at any company that collects, removes, transports or disposes of putrescible waste, identify the company or companies.\n      � 4.

The commission may, after notice and the opportunity to be heard, disqualify an officer of a labor union or labor organization subject to the jurisdiction of the commission pursuant to section 16-503 from holding office when such person: (i) has failed, by the date prescribed by the commission, to be fingerprinted or to provide truthful information in connection with the reporting requirements of subdivisions c and d of section 16-505; (ii) is the subject of a pending indictment or criminal action against such officer for a crime which bears a direct relationship to the trade waste industry, in which case the commission may defer a determination until a decision has been reached by the court before which such action is pending; (iii) has been convicted of a crime which, under the standards set forth in article 23-A of the correction law, bears a direct relationship to the trade waste industry, in which case the commission shall also consider the bearing, if any, that the criminal offense or offenses will have on the fitness of the officer to perform his or her responsibilities, the time which has elapsed since the occurrence of the criminal offense or offenses; the seriousness of the offense or offenses, and any information produced by the person, or produced on his or her behalf, in regard to his or her rehabilitation or good conduct; (iv) has been convicted of a racketeering activity or associated with a person who has been convicted of a racketeering activity, including but not limited to the offenses listed in subdivision one of section nineteen hundred sixty-one of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations statute (18 U.S.C. � 1961, et seq.) or of an offense listed in subdivision one of section 460.10 of the penal law, as such statutes may be amended from time to time, when the officer knew or should have known of such conviction; or (v) has associated with any member or associate of an organized crime group, as identified by a federal, state or city law enforcement or investigative agency, when the officer knew or should have known of the organized crime associations of such person. An officer required to disclose information pursuant to subdivisions c and d of section 16-505 may submit to the commission any material or explanation which such officer believes demonstrates that such information does not reflect adversely upon the officer's good character, honesty and integrity. If the commission determines pursuant to this subdivision that there are sufficient grounds to disqualify a person from holding office in a labor union or labor organization, the commission shall suspend such person from holding office pending a final determination and, in the event such person is disqualified, such suspension shall continue pending resignation or vacatur of or removal from office.\n      � 5.
