  "Summary": "This bill would require food delivery applications and couriers to make available insulated bags to any delivery worker who has completed at least six deliveries for the company. The food delivery application or courier would not be permitted to charge their delivery worker any money for the bag. The bag would also have to comply with Section 1235 of the State Vehicle and Traffic Law, which prohibits bicyclists from carrying bags or other articles unless they can keep at least one hand on the handlebars.  The bill would add a provision to the licensing scheme passed last month allowing the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection to suspend, revoke, deny or refuse to renew a food delivery application license if any provision relating to protections for delivery workers was violated twice in the previous two years.",
