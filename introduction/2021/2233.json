It would set fixed penalties at the bottom of existing penalty ranges, lower existing penalty ceilings (or sometimes set a lower fixed amount), or lower existing fixed penalties. In certain instances, the bill would allow a cure period for a first violation, or it would eliminate the civil penalty for a first violation. This bill would also clarify that submission of proof of cure for consumer affairs and health violations is an admission of liability only if the proof is accepted by the relevant agency, repeal a number of requirements and prohibitions in the Administrative Code to provide relief for small businesses, and make an administrative change to the storefront registry filing requirement.","TextID":70327,"Text":"Int.
