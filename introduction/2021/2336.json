  "Summary": "This bill would require third-party food delivery services – entities that provide restaurants with online order and delivery services – to provide the opportunity for customers to tip employees of the restaurant with which they placed their online order. Third-party food delivery services that choose to provide separate opportunities to tip by recipient during the order transaction would be required to clearly and conspicuously label each opportunity with each corresponding recipient. The opportunity to tip would have to be provided at the same time or before the customer would be able to conclude the online transaction. Third-party food delivery services that violate the provisions of the bill would be liable for civil penalties.",
