  "Summary": "This bill completes the most recent code revision cycle with amendments to the New York City Building, Fuel Gas, Mechanical and Plumbing Codes, based on the 2015 editions of the International Building, Fuel Gas, Mechanical and Plumbing Codes published by the International Code Council, where necessary, modifying or adding new text tailored to the unique needs and characteristics of the Cityâ€™s built environment. The bill also contains provisions to modify the General Administrative Provisions and New York City Electrical Code. The proposed legislation improves building construction standards for new buildings and resolves issues relating to the application of some provisions of the new codes to the alteration of existing buildings. Focused on preserving the principles of safety, savings, and innovation, this code revision cycle upgrades these concepts to include additional levels of enhancements, such as promoting sustainability along with resiliency, economizing resources, including affordable housing elements, and enhancing the tenant protection plan.",
