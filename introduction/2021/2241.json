  "Summary": "This bill would require that employees laid off as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic be offered the same or similar position first, once the position from which they were terminated or another similar position becomes available. Managers, supervisors, confidential employees, and those required to possess an occupational license would not be covered by the rehire requirement.  Existing anti-retaliation and enforcement provisions would apply to this legislation. A private right of action would be authorized, as would enforcement by the Commissioner of Consumer and Worker Protection and the Corporation Counsel. The bill would further require that any successor business retain the rehiring requirements of the prior business.",
