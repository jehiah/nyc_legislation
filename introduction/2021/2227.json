  "Summary": "The proposed bill would require the Department of Education (DOE) to report on the policies and procedures developed between the DOE and the New York City Police Department (NYPD), that relate to (i) allowing school principals to provide input on the performance of the school safety agents (SSAs) assigned to their school, and (ii) ensuring that school leadership is made aware of any deployment changes to SSAs assigned to their schools. The proposed bill would further require the DOE to report on any changes to such policies and procedures, and to provide a description of the input principals have given regarding the performance of school safety personnel assigned to their schools.",
