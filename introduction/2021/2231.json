Pursuant to that law, this local law would allow the Department of Finance (“DOF”) to require renewal applications where there is reason to believe the property is no longer eligible to receive the exemption because the property owner: 1) changed their primary residence, (2) added another owner to the deed of the property for which such exemption was granted, (3) transferred such property to a new owner, or (4) died, and require DOF to notify the applicable property owners of this requirement.","TextID":69718,"Text":"Int.
