  "Summary": "This bill would require that city agencies provide the Council with a copy of the departmental statement of needs for city facilities that is submitted annually to the Mayor. It would also require that real property owners or real estate professionals working on their behalf notify the city 30 days before properties will be listed for sale. The notification would be submitted through a website specified by the Commissioner of Citywide Administrative Services. The website would also track whether any city agency is interested in acquiring the real property. The bill would also preserve the city’s authority to use the uniform land use review procedures or eminent domain to acquire properties if applicable.",
