  "Summary": "This bill would require the Commissioner of Consumer and Worker Protection to report on all violations of subchapter 22 of chapter 5 of title 20 of the Administrative Code and rules promulgated thereunder. Those provisions regulate certain conduct of third-party delivery services, including by placing a 15% cap on delivery fees levied on restaurants during a state of emergency and banning delivery fees charged for telephone orders during states of emergency. The report will include, but not be limited to, the company name, the date of the violation, the section of law violated, any penalties assessed such as monetary penalties, injunctive relief, or court fees and costs, and the borough where the violation occurred. The Commissioner of Consumer and Worker Protection would also be required to report on presumed violations of these provisions after June 2, 2020, during times when they are not in effect because no state of emergency is in place.",
