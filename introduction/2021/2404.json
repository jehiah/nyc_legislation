  "Summary": "This bill would extend the certification of no harassment pilot created by Local Law 1 of 2018 until September 27, 2026. Buildings discharged from Article 7-A program, unless such building is the subject of a rehabilitation loan; buildings where a full vacate order has been issued, except where such vacate order was issued due to a fire; buildings where there has been active participation in the alternative enforcement program which have been discharged from such program; buildings where a court or DHCR have made a harassment finding; and buildings indicating significant distress as determined by the Building Qualification Index (BQI) would be required to apply for the CONH for covered work. Interior demolition conducted during renovation of occupied units necessary to protect public health and safety, or repairs, replacement, modification, or partial demolition work in a building that is the minimum required to be performed to address conditions for rescission of a vacate order would not require a CONH.  A court may find that acts of harassment that caused the denial of a certification of no harassment constitute harassment and shall in those cases award to each lawful occupant of a dwelling unit that was subject to such harassment $5,000 plus reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.",
