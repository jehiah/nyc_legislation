Buildings where an Article 7-A administrator has been appointed, buildings where the department of buildings has determined there has been a failure to comply with any term of a tenant protection plan, buildings included on the speculation watch list, and buildings in any community district determined to be at a high risk for displacement by the equitable development data tool would be required to apply for the CONH for covered work. The Building Qualification Index (BQI) would be updated to include open and closed hazardous and immediately hazardous violations issued by the department of health and mental hygiene or department of buildings. Penalties for new determinations of harassment following a CONH application would include a civil penalty of not less than two thousand dollars and not more than ten thousand dollars for each dwelling unit and twice the rent charged for the month of the CONH denial for each of up to five years of occupancy.","TextID":70538,"Text":"Preconsidered Int.
