The term \"food delivery worker\" means a natural person who is hired or retained as an independent contractor by a food service establishment, as an independent contractor of a third-party food delivery service or as an independent contractor of a third-party courier service, as defined in section 20-1501, to deliver food or beverage from such establishment to a consumer in exchange for compensation.\n      Toilet facility. The term \"toilet facility\" means a toilet facility on the premises of a food service establishment that is a dedicated facility for its patrons or that is a dedicated facility for its employees to the extent such establishment does not have a dedicated facility for its patrons. \n      � 2. Subdivision b of section 20-563.6 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by a local law for the year 2021 amending the administrative code of the city of New York, relating to the licensing of third-party food delivery services, and repealing subchapter 22 of chapter 5 of title 20 of the administrative code of the city of New York, relating to third-party food delivery services, as proposed in introduction number 1897, is amended to read as follows:\n      b.

Such agreement shall not include a provision, clause, or covenant that requires a food service establishment to indemnify a third-party food delivery service, any independent contractor acting on behalf of the third-party food delivery service, or any registered agent of the third-party food delivery service, for any damages or harm by an act or omission occurring after the food service establishment's product leaves the place of business of the food service establishment. To the extent an agreement executed in accordance with this section contains such a provision, such provision shall be deemed void and unenforceable.\n      � 3.
