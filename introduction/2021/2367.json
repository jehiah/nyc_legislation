  "Summary": "This bill would create an affirmative defense to parking violations issued to vehicle owners for the failure to observe a parking sign. The defense would apply when pavement markings on the roadway designate a parking space. Such affirmative defense would not be available if Department of Transportation (DOT) installed a physical barrier in the parking space to designate no parking or where pavement markings designate a parking space, but street signs limit the times when parking is authorized or the type of vehicle authorized to park in such parking space. This bill would also require DOT to notify vehicle owners of such affirmative defense.",
