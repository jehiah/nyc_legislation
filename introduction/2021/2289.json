  "Summary": "This bill would require food delivery applications and couriers to provide delivery workers with the opportunity to set: (i) a maximum distance per trip they will travel; and (ii) that the worker will not accept trips over bridges or tunnels.  Applications and couriers would be obligated to allow workers to change parameters at any time. Applications or couriers could not offer a worker trips inconsistent with the parameters or penalize a worker for their parameters. The following information would be provided before a trip: • address where the food, beverage or other goods must be picked up; • estimated time and distance per trip; • any gratuity; and • compensation to be paid, excluding gratuity.  In addition, the bill would set forth various definitions; obligations on the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, applications and couriers; and enforcement options, including those available to the City and to workers, that would apply to all laws relating to food delivery workers.",
