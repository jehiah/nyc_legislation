  "Summary": "This bill would require food delivery applications and couriers to provide delivery workers with the opportunity to set: (i) a maximum distance per trip they will travel; and (ii) that the worker will not accept trips over bridges or tunnels.  Applications and couriers would be obligated to allow workers to change parameters at any time. Applications or couriers could not offer a worker trips inconsistent with the parameters or penalize a worker for their parameters. The following information would be provided before a trip: • address where the food, beverage or other goods must be picked up; • estimated time and distance per trip; • any gratuity; and • compensation to be paid, excluding gratuity.  In addition, the bill would set forth various definitions; obligations on the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, applications and couriers; and enforcement options, including those available to the City and to workers, that would apply to all laws relating to food delivery workers.",

The department shall keep the identity of any complainant confidential unless disclosure is necessary to resolve the investigation or is otherwise required by law.

For violations of their rights under this chapter, a food delivery worker shall be entitled to the following relief:\n      \t1. all compensatory damages and other relief required to make the worker or former worker whole;\n      \t2. an order directing compliance with the requirements set forth in this chapter; and\n      \t3. for each violation of:\n(a) section 20-1504,\n           \t \t(1) $500 for each violation not involving denial of future work opportunities;\n            \t(2) $2,500 for each violation involving denial of future work opportunities; and\n\t\t(3) any equitable relief appropriate under the circumstances, including but not limited to payment of any lost earnings resulting from such retaliation.\n         \t(b) section 20-1521, $200;\n         \t(c) section 20-1522, including any minimum payment established by rule pursuant to section 20-1522, three times the amount of any payment that should have been made and was not timely made;\n         \t(d) section 20-1523, $200; and\n      (e) section 20-1524, $200.\n   \tb. The relief authorized by this section shall be imposed on a per worker and per instance basis for each violation.\n      � 20-1509 Civil penalties. a. For each violation of this chapter, a third-party food delivery service or third-party courier service is liable for a penalty of $500 for the first violation and, for subsequent violations that occur within two years of any previous violation of this chapter, up to $750 for the second violation and up to $1,000 for each succeeding violation.\n   \tb. The penalties imposed pursuant to this section shall be imposed on a per worker and per instance basis for each violation.\n      � 20-1510 Enforcement by the corporation counsel. The corporation counsel or such other persons designated by the corporation counsel on behalf of the department may initiate in any court of competent jurisdiction any action or proceeding that may be appropriate or necessary for correction of any violation issued pursuant to sections 20-1507 through 20-1509, including actions to secure permanent injunctions, enjoining any acts or practices that constitute such violation, mandating compliance with the provisions of this chapter, or such other relief as may be appropriate.\n      � 20-1511 Private cause of action. a. Any person alleging a violation of the following provisions of this chapter may bring a civil action, in accordance with applicable law, in any court of competent jurisdiction:\n      \t1. section 20-1504;\n      \t2. section 20-1521;\n      \t3. section 20-1522, including any minimum payment established by rule pursuant to section 20-1522;\n      4. section 20-1523; and\n      5. section 20-1524.\n   \tb.

Failure to so serve a notice does not adversely affect any person's cause of action.\n      \t2. A worker need not file a complaint with the department pursuant to subdivision b of section 20-1507 before bringing a civil action; however, no person shall file a civil action after filing a complaint with the department unless such complaint has been withdrawn or dismissed without prejudice to further action.\n      \t3. No person shall file a complaint with the department after filing a civil action unless such action has been withdrawn or dismissed without prejudice to further action.\n      \t4. The commencement or pendency of a civil action by a worker does not preclude the department from investigating a third-party food delivery service  or third-party courier service or commencing, prosecuting or settling a case against a third-party food delivery service or third-party courier service based on some or all of the same violations.\n      � 20-1512 Civil action by corporation counsel for pattern or practice of violations.\n   \ta. 1.

Nothing in this section prohibits (i) the department from exercising its authority under section 20-1507 through 20-1509 or (ii) a person alleging a violation of this chapter from filing a complaint pursuant to section 20-1507 or a civil action pursuant to section 20-1511 based on the same facts pertaining to such a pattern or practice, provided that a civil action pursuant to this section shall not have previously been commenced.\n   \tb.
