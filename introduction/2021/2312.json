  "Summary": "Where a tenant vacates a residential dwelling unit in violation of the terms of a lease, subject to the mitigation provisions already provided in state law, pursuant to section 227-e of the Real Property Law, this bill would limit the resulting fees recoverable by the landlord to the fair market cost necessary to prepare the residential dwelling unit for rental. The landlord would also be required to provide an itemized list to the tenant demonstrating how such fair market cost was calculated.",
