  "Summary": "This bill would assist individuals who are in custody of the Department of Correction (“DOC”) to apply for a New York City identity card (“IDNYC”). The Human Resources Administration (“HRA”) would be required to allow a book and case number or a New York State identification number utilized by the Department of Criminal Justice Services to be used as proof of identity for the purposes of obtaining an IDNYC. HRA would also be required to designate sites at each DOC facility where an incarcerated person may apply for an IDNYC. DOC would be required to facilitate this process by providing assistance in completing the IDNYC application, including written documentation of the individual’s book and case number or a New York State identification number, a photo of the incarcerated person to submit with the application, and a letter stating that the incarcerated person has resided in New York City for at least 15 days and lacks a home address, if applicable. DOC would also be required to notify each eligible person in their custody of their ability to apply for an IDNYC.",
