  "Summary": "This bill would prohibit a person from serving with the Police Department if such person has previously been dismissed from a police force for misconduct, or has resigned from a police force during an investigation for misconduct. The Department of Citywide Administrative Services would not permit a candidate to take a civil service exam for a position with the Police Department if such candidate does not meet this qualification.",

Consistent with subdivision 4 of section 50 of the civil service law and section 813 of the charter, a person who has been a member of any police force shall not be appointed as a member of the force if such person was dismissed from such other police force due to misconduct or resigned while being investigated pursuant to a charge of misconduct. Persons who are appointed as police trainees, after examination in accordance with the civil service law and the rules of the commissioner of citywide administrative services and who have satisfactorily completed service as such trainees, may likewise be appointed as police officers without further written examination, provided that they shall have passed a medical examination at the end of their required trainee period.
