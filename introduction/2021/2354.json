  "Summary": "This bill would amend the definition of the term “veteran” to additionally include persons currently serving in the active military service, regardless of discharge status or time served. The bill would also amend the definition to include those who serve or have served in the United States Public Health Service or as a commissioned member of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. This bill would also increase the membership of the Veterans’ Advisory Board (VAB) to 13 members, two of whom must be immediate family members, spouses or domestic partners, survivors or caregivers of veterans. The Department of Veterans’ Services (DVS) would also be required to publish, and regularly update, a list of all VAB members on the department’s website including term information and appointing official.",
