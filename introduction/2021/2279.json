  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation (“DOT”) to designate as commercial loading zones at least 25% of curb space available for parking in select census tracts and zoning districts. DOT would be given discretion to determine that the designation of commercial loading zones in a particular census tract is not necessary because of local conditions such as access to existing loading berths or commercial vehicle parking, provided that such determination is explained in writing and posted on the DOT’s website, submitted to the speaker of the council and to any affected council member and community board.",
