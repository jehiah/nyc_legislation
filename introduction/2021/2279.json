  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation (“DOT”) to create a public methodology for determining where loading zones are necessary to enhance safety and reduce traffic congestion. DOT would be required to create at least five loading zones annually in each neighborhood tabulation area that meets the department’s methodology, provided that no fewer than 500 total new loading zones are created citywide annually for the first three years following the effective date of the local law. By January 1, 2023, DOT would also be required to report on its progress toward implementing loading zones, and to publicly post the location of all loading zones citywide.",
