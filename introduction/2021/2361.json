  "Summary": "Pursuant to Local Law 152 of 2016 and Department of Buildings (DOB), rules, between January 1 and December 31 of every fourth year, building gas piping systems must be inspected in community districts in all boroughs. DOB rules also require submission of a certification that all conditions identified in the inspection report have been corrected no later than 120 days, or if more time is needed, no later than 180 days following the inspection date. This bill would require DOB to create a questionnaire that could be shared with stakeholders and members of the public. Through this questionnaire, DOB could seek feedback on Local Law 152.  Starting on March 1, 2022, and on every following March 1, DOB would be required to report to the Council, the Mayor, and post on its website, the results of the questionnaires received during the prior calendar year.",
