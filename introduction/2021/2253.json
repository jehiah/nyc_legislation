  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation (“DOT”) to establish a pilot program that creates at least 12 micro-distribution centers. The micro-distribution centers would each be at least 800 square feet, and would be used exclusively for transferring goods from commercial vehicles to sustainable modes of transportation such as cargo bicycles, electric vehicles, or hand trucks for final distribution. The bill would require electric vehicle charging infrastructure at a minimum of three centers, and that DOT create a reservation system for access to the centers.",
