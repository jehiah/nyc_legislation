  "Summary": "Pursuant to Local Law 152 of 2016 and Department of Buildings (DOB), rules, between January 1 and December 31 of every fourth year, building gas piping systems must be inspected in community districts in all boroughs. DOB rules also require submission of a certification that all conditions identified in the inspection report have been corrected no later than 120 days, or if more time is needed, no later than 180 days following the inspection date. Although a late certification is permitted when additional time for a correction is needed, where a property owner is unable to timely complete an inspection, there is no way for the property owner to seek an extension of time to complete the inspection. In addition, a property owner is required to have gas piping in their building inspected, even if the building does not have active gas service. This bill would allow a property owner of a building with gas piping but not active gas service to forego their gas piping inspection so long as they provide certification from their utility company and themselves that there is no active gas service in their building.  If they resume gas service they must obtain a certificate of approval of gas installation from DOB and comply with the gas piping inspection and certification requirements of local Law 152.  This bill also allows DOB to grant additional time to submit a certification, beyond 180 days, if additional time is needed to ameliorate conditions that must be corrected. Finally, this bill provides a 180 day extension to comply with both the inspection and certification requirements of Local Law 152 for any building owner who requests an extension.",

If such certification notes that one or more conditions will take additional time to complete, such owner shall, no later than 180 days after the due date for such inspection, or by such later date as the department shall determine, submit to the department, in a form and manner determined by the department, a certification from a licensed master plumber that all conditions identified in such report have been corrected.\n\n      � 3.

Comply with the inspection and certification requirements of sections 28-318.1, 28-\n318.2 and 28-318.3 and the rules of the department before gas service is resumed, regardless of whether such inspection and certification would otherwise be required for that building at that time.\n\n      � 4. Article 318 of section of chapter 3 of title 28 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 28-318.3.7 as follows:\n� 28-318.3.7 Extension of time to complete inspection. Owners who are unable to obtain an inspection of a building pursuant to this article by the date set forth in the rules of the department may receive a 180 day extension of the due date for such inspection, and the filing of any certification required to be filed after such inspection, upon notification to the department in a manner established by the department. The department shall conduct periodic outreach to owners of buildings with gas piping systems that must be inspected pursuant to this article regarding the availability of this extension.   \n\n\n      � 5.
