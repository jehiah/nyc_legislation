DOB rules also require submission of a certification that all conditions identified in the inspection report have been corrected no later than 120 days, or if more time is needed, no later than 180 days following the inspection date. Although a late certification is permitted when additional time for a correction is needed, where a property owner is unable to timely complete an inspection, there is no way for the property owner to seek an extension of time to complete the inspection.  This bill would create a hardship program that would allow a building owner, who is unable to timely comply with the inspection by the inspection due, to apply to a hardship program. Upon acceptance to this hardship program, the property owner will receive a deferral of the due date for the inspection, and all associated due dates, for 90 days. If the property owner does not complete the inspection within that 90-day period, the property owner will be responsible for all noncompliance penalties. This bill also requires the DOB commissioner to conduct outreach to buildings with gas piping systems that must be inspected six months before the associated due dates.","TextID":70136,"Text":"Int.
