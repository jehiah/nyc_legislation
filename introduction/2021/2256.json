The reports would include the efforts DCLA and cultural institutions have made to improve access, data regarding such access and any challenges with access and the efforts to address such challenges. The plan would include recommendations regarding how to improve access and how DCLA will implement such recommendations. DCLA would provide the report and plan to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council and post it online on its website.",
