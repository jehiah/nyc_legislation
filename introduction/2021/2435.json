  "Summary": "This bill would prohibit a motor vehicle owner from affixing a speaker to the exterior of a vehicle, and would impose a civil penalty of between $100-225 for a first violation, $150-400 for a second violation, and $200-575 for a third and any subsequent violation. This bill would also increase the civil penalties for creating an unreasonable noise from a personal audio device. The Police Department would also be required to tow a vehicle for any repeat offenses of these violations.",
