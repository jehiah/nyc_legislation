  "Summary": "This bill would require the Police Department (NYPD) to train officers on responding to incidents involving domestic violence, sexual crimes, or human trafficking. The training would be developed from recommendations made by an interdisciplinary, interagency committee consisting of representatives of the NYPD, the Mayor’s Office to End Domestic and Gender-based Violence, the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice, domestic violence service providers, sexual assault service providers, and human trafficking service providers. In addition, the bill would add such service providers to the City’s domestic fatality review committee and create a fatality advisory committee to review individual case level data on gender based and domestic violence fatalities.",

Such report shall be posted on the department's website and submitted to the mayor, the speaker of the council, and the members of the committee formed pursuant to subdivision b of this section.  \n      � 2.
