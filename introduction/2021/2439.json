  "Summary": "This bill would require the Police Department (NYPD) to train officers on responding to incidents involving domestic violence, sexual crimes, or human trafficking. The training would be developed from recommendations made by an interdisciplinary, interagency committee consisting of representatives of the NYPD, the Mayorâ€™s Office to End Domestic and Gender-based Violence, the Mayorâ€™s Office of Criminal Justice, domestic violence service providers, sexual assault service providers, and human trafficking service providers. In addition, the bill would add such service providers to the Cityâ€™s domestic fatality review committee and create a fatality advisory committee to review individual case level data on gender based and domestic violence fatalities.",

Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings:\n      Domestic violence. The term \"domestic violence\" means acts or threats of violence, not including acts of self-defense, committed by a family or household member against another family or household member. \n      Family offense. The term \"family offense\" shall mean an act or threat of an act as defined in section 530.11 of the criminal procedure law.\n      Human trafficking.

The term \"sexual crimes\" means any offense in article 130 of the penal law.\n      b. Training requirement. \n      1. The department shall develop, and implement by September 30, 2022, a victim-centered, trauma-informed questioning training program designed to develop skills for the response to and investigation of incidents involving domestic violence, sexual crimes, or human trafficking. The training program shall include but not be limited to the following components: the dynamics of domestic violence, sexual assault, and human trafficking, including abuser tactics of power and control; danger and lethality factors in domestic violence, sexual assault, and human trafficking cases; the criminal law provisions of the Family Protection Domestic Violence Intervention Act of 1994, codified in chapter 222 of the laws of 1994; how to determine the primary aggressor in a domestic violence incident; the family offenses; the offense of endangering the welfare of a child; the offenses of assault in the first degree, manslaughter in the first and second degrees, criminally negligent homicide, and murder in the second degree, together with the defense of justification and the role of trauma in victims' acts of self-defense; the importance of avoiding expressions of skepticism, victim-blaming, and minimizing of the offense in early communications with victims; how to recognize signs of drug-facilitated sexual assault and preserve crucial evidence thereof; the overlap among domestic violence, sexual assault and human trafficking; victim-centered, trauma-informed questioning in domestic violence, sexual assault, human trafficking, and related cases; the effects of trauma on victims; techniques of trauma-informed policing; the resources available to victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and human trafficking, including shelter and nonresidential services, locating hospital-based sexual assault forensic exams, and domestic violence, sexual assault, and human trafficking emergency resources; and any other training deemed relevant by the commissioner, except that the commissioner may eliminate a training component or replace a training component with an alternative component in order to provide a comprehensive victim-centered, trauma-informed questioning training program. \n      2. There shall be an interdisciplinary and interagency committee that shall meet no later than May 1, 2022, and twice a year thereafter. The committee shall make recommendations to the department with respect to the training program required by this subdivision. Each member of the committee will use their insights from interactions with programs and survivors of domestic violence, sexual crimes, and human trafficking to help evaluate whether previous trainings accomplished the goals of the trainings.
