  "Summary": "The Zoning Resolution established the Inclusionary Housing Program and other affordable housing programs to ensure that the housing marketplace serves New Yorkers at a broader range of income levels. These affordable housing programs promote economic integration in areas of the City undergoing substantial new residential development by requiring a portion of the housing developed be permanently affordable to provide for long-term stability and economic diversity in neighborhoods. This bill authorizes the Department of Housing Preservation and Development to enforce the affordable housing provisions placed within its responsibility in the Zoning Resolution, and provides procedures by which enforcement is to take place. Without this authorization, the city would be limited in its ability to ensure that the Zoning Resolution’s affordable housing programs are serving their purpose and would lack the ability to penalize those who would cheat the system.",
