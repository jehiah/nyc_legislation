This report would have to include, in a searchable and machine-readable format, the following information for misconduct reports received by the Commissioner, Special Commissioner of Investigation, or Corporation Counsel in the last year or in an earlier year with an investigation remaining open: the year the report was received, the implicated agency, which paragraph of section 12-113(b) the report arose under, whether an investigation was initiated, the number of days an investigation has been open, and for closed investigations an outcome summary. The bill would further require that the Commissioner and Special Commissioner’s web applications to track compliance with investigations and recommendations also cover certain contractors and subcontractors that are investigated.",
