  "Summary": "This bill would require employers to hold a meeting with employees who are returning to the workplace after taking parental leave.

Employees who do not wish to participate in the meeting must opt out in writing.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection 1. Chapter 1 of title 8 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 8-134 to read as follows:\n\t� 8-134 Onboarding meeting after parental leave. 1. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms have the following meanings:\n\tOnboarding meeting. The term \"onboarding meeting\" means a meeting between an employer, or an employer's designee, and an employee regarding the conditions and expectations of employment after such employee returns from parental leave. The substantive agenda of such a meeting shall adhere to the guidelines promulgated by the commission.\n      Parental leave. The term \"parental leave\" means any job-protected paid or unpaid leave taken pursuant to chapter 28 of title 29 of the United States code, section 204 of the worker's compensation law or other parental leave benefit program provided by an employer that an employee may use to bond with a new child.\n\t2. Guidelines. The commission shall promulgate guidelines regarding the timeline, topics of discussion, relevant rights and responsibilities, goals, format and duration of such an onboarding meeting within 90 days of the effective date of the local law that added this section. These guidelines may be updated by the commission as needed thereafter.\n\t3. Compliance. Every employer must hold an onboarding meeting with every employee who returns from parental leave within two weeks of such employee's return. An employee may opt out of an onboarding meeting by informing the employer in writing. The employer shall keep such record for at least five years and shall make such record available for review by the commission upon the commission's request. The onboarding meeting required by this section is intended to establish a minimum threshold and shall not be construed to prohibit any employer from providing additional onboarding meetings or support for employees returning from parental leave. An employer shall keep a record of compliance with this section and retain such records for at least five years. \n\t4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this section shall not apply to employers to whom the commission grants an exemption based on bona fide considerations of public policy.\n      5. Nothing in this section shall be construed to create a protected class in itself.  \n\t� 2. This local law takes effect 180 days after it becomes law, except that the chairperson of the New York city commission on human rights may take all actions necessary for its implementation, including the promulgation of rules, prior to such date.\n\n\n\n\n\nAW/SG\nLS # 11862\n9/30/2020\n1",
