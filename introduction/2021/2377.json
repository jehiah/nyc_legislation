  "Summary": "Pursuant to Local Law 152 of 2016 and Department of Buildings (DOB), rules, between January 1 and December 31 of every fourth year, building gas piping systems must be inspected in community districts in all boroughs. DOB rules also require submission of a certification that all conditions identified in the inspection report have been corrected no later than 120 days, or if more time is needed, no later than 180 days following the inspection date. Currently, inspections conducted under Local Law 152 include exposed gas lines from point of entry up to individual tenant spaces. This bill extends the physical scope of inspection from individual tenant spaces to the point of connection for any equipment that uses gas supplied by gas piping.",
