Subchapter 22 of chapter 5 of title 20 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 20-847.2 to read as follows:\n            � 20-847.2 Unauthorized listings. a. Notwithstanding section 20-845, for the purposes of this section the term \"third-party food delivery service\" means any website, mobile application or other internet service that offers or arranges for the sale of food and beverages prepared by, and the same-day delivery or same-day pickup of food and beverages from, a food service establishment located in the city that is owned and operated by a different person.\n            b. A third-party food delivery service shall not list, advertise, promote, or sell a food service establishment's products on, or arrange for the delivery of an order of such products through, the website, mobile application or other platform of such third-party food delivery service without a written agreement between such third-party delivery service and such food service establishment to include the food service establishment's products on such website, mobile application or other platform. \n            c. An agreement executed in accordance with this section shall not include a provision, clause, or covenant that requires a food service establishment to indemnify a third-party food delivery service, any independent contractor acting on behalf of the third-party food delivery service, or any registered agent of the third-party food delivery service, for any damages or harm by an act or omission occurring after the food service establishment's product leaves the place of business of the food service establishment. To the extent an agreement executed in accordance with this section contains such a provision, such provision shall be deemed void and unenforceable.\n            d. Outreach. No more than 30 days after the effective date of the local law that added this section, and continuing for 90 days thereafter, the commissioner shall conduct outreach in the designated citywide languages, as defined in section 23-1101, to alert food service establishments and third-party food delivery services to this section. Such outreach shall include, but need not be limited to, posting information on relevant agency websites and distributing information to food service establishments, third-party food delivery services and other relevant stakeholders.\n     � 2.
