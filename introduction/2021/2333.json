  "Summary": "This bill would prohibit third-party food delivery services – defined in this bill as any website, mobile application or other internet service that sells and offers delivery or pickup of food and beverages from a food service establishment owned by another entity – from listing food service establishments on their application or website and making deliveries from such establishments, without a written agreement between the delivery service and the establishment. It would also prohibit the delivery services from requiring the establishments, in these written agreements, to indemnify the delivery service or their independent contractors or agents for certain damage that occurs after food or beverages leave the establishment. Violations of this bill would be subject to a civil penalty of not more than $500 per day per establishment with respect to which a violation was committed. The Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection would be required to conduct outreach about the requirements of this bill.",
