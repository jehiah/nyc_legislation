It would also prohibit the delivery services from requiring the establishments, in these written agreements, to indemnify the delivery service or their independent contractors or agents for certain damage that occurs after food or beverages leave the establishment. Violations of this bill would be subject to a civil penalty of not more than $500 per day per establishment with respect to which a violation was committed. The Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection would be required to conduct outreach about the requirements of this bill.","TextID":70418,"Text":"Int.
