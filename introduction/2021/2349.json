  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Sanitation (DSNY) to increase permitted capacity for transfer stations in designated community districts that demonstrate that within four years of notifying DSNY, the transfer station would transport all or the majority of its waste by rail.  The transfer station would have to submit to DSNY annual reports that detail the transfer station’s progress toward converting to rail and the number of trucks per day that transport waste from the transfer station.  If the transfer station does not complete the project or is unable to secure financing, its permitted capacity would be reduced.",
