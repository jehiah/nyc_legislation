  "Summary": "The proposed legislation would require the Department of Citywide Administrative Services (“DCAS”), in consultation with the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications, to conduct a study on the feasibility of reimbursing the use of personal devices, including but not limited to mobile devices and computers, by City agency employees in performing work for the City remotely during the COVID-19 emergency. Such study would, at a minimum, assess potential barriers to such reimbursement, including but not limited to collective bargaining, and assess the estimated costs of providing such reimbursement at varying levels. DCAS would be required to submit to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council a report of such study detailing its findings and recommendations.",
