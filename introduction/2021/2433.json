  "Summary": "This bill would require agencies that issue notices of violation (NOVs) returnable to the Environmental Control Board or a tribunal of the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings to provide their enforcement officers with portable devices capable of issuing NOVs electronically. The bill would also require enforcement officers to use such devices whenever issuing NOVs, except when doing so would lead to an inaccurate or invalid NOV under the circumstances. In addition, the bill would require each issuing agency to report annually on the proportion of NOVs it issued electronically over the preceding fiscal year.",
