  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (“DoITT”) to create a separate link for rooftop activity complaints on the 311 website and mobile app, which would then provide links to further subcategories in order that each rooftop activity complaint be referred to the appropriate City agency for handling. DoITT would also be required to report annually on how such rooftop activity complaints are resolved. The bill would further require the Department of Buildings to report annually on the number of City rooftops with recreational spaces indicated on a Certificate of Occupancy or indicated on a Place of Assembly Certificate of Operation.",
