  "Summary": "This bill would change the budget process for the New York City Campaign Finance Board (the “Board”). Currently, the Board is required to provide itemized estimates of its financial needs to the Mayor, and the Mayor is required to include such estimates in the Executive Budget without revision. This bill would allow the Mayor’s Executive Budget to include appropriations for the Board that differ from the Board’s unrevised cost estimates.",
