Written notice of layoff. A covered employer shall provide a laid-off employee with written notice of the layoff, either in person or in writing to the employee's last-known address, or to the employee's phone number or email address if authorized by the employee. Such notice shall be provided at the time of layoff or within 60 days of the effective date of the local law that added this chapter if the layoff took place before such date. A covered employer shall provide notice to each laid-off employee in a language understood by such employee. The written notice shall include:\n            1. A notice of the layoff and the layoff's effective date;\n            2. The laid off-employee's seniority at the time of layoff; and\n            3. A summary of the rights provided by this chapter, including the right to recall and to receive and accept job offers made based on seniority, the right to be free from retaliation and the right to enforce one's rights in court.\n            b. The department shall make publicly available on its website, in a downloadable format in each designated citywide language as defined in section 23-1101, a notice containing the information that a covered employer must provide to a laid-off employee pursuant to paragraph 3 of subdivision a of this section.\n            c. When laying off an employee, a covered employer shall request the employee's preferred mailing address, phone number or email address for purposes of receiving offers of open positions pursuant to section 20-1403.\n            d. Recordkeeping. Covered employers shall retain the following records for each laid-off employee, for at least two years from the date the written notice of layoff was required to be provided to such laid-off employee pursuant to subdivision a of this section: name; job classification at the time of separation from employment; date of hire; last known address; last known email address and phone number, if applicable; a copy of the written notice of layoff provided to the laid-off employee; proof of any offers of available positions to the laid-off employee; and proof of any notices of non-qualification provided to the laid-off employee.\n            � 20-1405 Retaliatory action prohibited. No person shall refuse to employ, terminate, reduce in compensation or otherwise take any adverse action against any employee for seeking information or to enforce their rights under this chapter, for participating in any proceeding related to this chapter, for opposing or reporting any practice proscribed by this chapter or for otherwise asserting any right under this chapter. This section shall apply to any employee who mistakenly, but in good faith, alleges a violation of this chapter.\n            � 20-1406 Enforcement. a. This chapter may be enforced in a civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction brought by one or more employees on their own behalf or on behalf of themselves and other similarly situated employees. An employee may designate an agent or representative to maintain such an action.\n            b. If a court finds that a covered employer violated this chapter, it may enjoin the covered employer from engaging in such violation and may award any other appropriate affirmative relief, including compensatory damages, back pay and reinstatement or hiring of employees with or without back pay including fringe benefits. Interim earnings or amounts earnable with reasonable diligence by employees prevailing in such action shall operate to reduce any back pay otherwise allowable. Before such interim earnings are deducted from such back pay, the court shall deduct from such interim earnings any reasonable amounts expended by such employees in searching for, obtaining or relocating to new employment. A court may also order punitive damages if it finds that a covered employer violated this chapter with malice or with reckless indifference to the requirements of this chapter. If a court finds that a covered employer terminated an employee in violation of section 20-1405, the court may award, in addition to reinstatement, three times the amount of back pay and compensatory damages awarded.\n            c. If a covered employer takes an adverse action against an employee within 60 days of such employee's exercise of rights pursuant to, or any other activity protected by, this chapter, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that such adverse action was taken in violation of section 20-1405.\n            d. If an employee prevails in a civil action brought under this section, the court shall award reasonable attorney's fees and costs and expert witness fees incurred in bringing such action.\n            � 20-1407 Expiration. This chapter expires on December 31, 2031.\n            � 2. This local law takes effect immediately and remains in effect until December 31, 2031, when it is deemed repealed, provided that all actions and proceedings arising from events that occurred prior to such date may be prosecuted and defended to final effect in the same manner as they might if this local law were not so repealed.\n\n#11715137v1\nLW/MA/JL/MS\n- 1 -",
