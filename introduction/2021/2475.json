  "Summary": "Current law requires a new or amended Certificate of Occupancy (“CO”) when a building or lot undergoes a change from one occupancy or zoning group to another, or is being changed in a manner inconsistent with the existing CO. This bill would provide an exception from the requirement to obtain a new or amended CO, in the case of certain hotels built on or before July 1, 1969 that had been used for transient purposes but subsequently are to be occupied by longer-term, rent-stabilized tenants. This exception would apply regardless of whether a tenant acquired rent stabilized-status after occupying a unit, or was offered a lease in advance of occupying the unit.",
