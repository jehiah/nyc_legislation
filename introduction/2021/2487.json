  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Finance (DOF) to establish a one-year program for owners to resolve outstanding reports, owed to the Department of Buildings (DOB) for the past six calendar years, and any associated unpaid civil penalties. Under the temporary program, an owner could file an outstanding report and pay $500 per report to resolve any associated unpaid civil penalties. The bill would also require DOF and DOB to conduct community outreach and to report on the results of the program.",
