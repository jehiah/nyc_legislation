  "Summary": "This bill would amend an existing law that prohibits third-party food delivery services - entities that provide food service establishments with online order and delivery services - from charging such establishments for telephone orders that did not result in a transaction during the call. Under the existing law, such charges are prohibited only when certain conditions apply. This bill would instead prohibit such charges from the anticipated end date of those conditions until February 17, 2022.",
