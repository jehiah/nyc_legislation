  "Summary": "This bill would offer expenditure limit relief to candidates participating in the City’s campaign finance program if they face high-spending independent spenders. Under the bill, when independent expenditures equal 50 percent of the expenditure limit in a particular election, the expenditure limit for all candidates in that election would increase by 50 percent. When independent expenditures equal 300 percent of the expenditure limit in a particular election, the expenditure limit for all candidates in that election would be lifted completely.",
