This would ensure that BSA decisions affecting property in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx would be available in the Automatic City Register Information System (ACRIS), and BSA decisions affecting property in Staten Island would be available in the electronic recording system maintained by the Richmond County Clerk.","TextID":69980,"Text":"Int.
