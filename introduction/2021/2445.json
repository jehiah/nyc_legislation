  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Social Services (DSS) and the Department of Homeless Services (DHS) to submit quarterly reports on requests for agency conferences, requests for fair hearings and representation at fair hearings for applicants who have been denied public benefits and temporary housing provided by the agencies. Such reports would be submitted to the Mayor, the Speaker of the Council and the Public Advocate and posted on the DSS and DHS websites. The reports would include the language that DSS and DHS provided to those denied any of the DSS-administered public benefits or DHS temporary housing. The reports would also disaggregate the number and percent of denied public benefits and temporary housing applications, by requests for agency conferences, requests for fair hearings and fair hearing representation, and by the demographics of the applicant.",
