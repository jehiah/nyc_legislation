  "Summary": "This bill would require agencies to conduct outreach and education tailored to businesses in minority- and women-owned business enterprise (M/WBE) categories for which agencies fail to achieve M/WBE utilization goals. Agencies would utilize the Office of Ethnic and Community Media and community-based organizations to conduct the outreach and education, which would inform businesses about issues related to agency procurement. This bill would also make technical amendments related to the numbering and headings of certain sections of the contracts and purchases chapter of the Administrative Code.",
