  "Summary": "This bill would require that all commercial loading zones are controlled by a muni-meter, extend the number of hours that commercial vehicles can park in loading zones from 3 to 8 hours, and set parking rates for commercial vehicles using commercial loading zones. In addition, the bill prohibits parking with a city-issued parking permit other than a permit issued to individuals with disabilities in commercial loading zones in the area south of and including 60th street in Manhattan and enables the Department of Transportation (“DOT”) to authorize cargo bicycles to park in commercial loading zones. The bill would also require construction permit applicants to either maintain access to existing commercial loading zones or create a temporary loading zone where construction staging must occupy or otherwise inhibit the use of an existing commercial loading zone.",
