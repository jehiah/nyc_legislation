  "Summary": "The bill would require that all permits of 180 days or more for a street segment with a truck loading zone carry a stipulation that such zone may not be occupied or obstructed. In the event that permitted work necessitates a loading zone obstruction, the Department of Transportation (DOT) may require that the applicant maintain a temporary loading zone, and revoke a permit or refuse to renew a permit for non-compliance. The bill would also amend the Administrative Code to prohibit the use of city-issued parking placards in certain spaces in the central business district of Manhattan, including truck-loading zones. The bill would also codify new and existing regulations for truck loading zones and commercial parking meter areas, including those related to how such spaces are metered or reserved and the lengths of time that they may be occupied, and would allow DOT to authorize cargo bicycles or other sustainable modes to use loading zones and to create reduced rates for zero emission vehicles.",
