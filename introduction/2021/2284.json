  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Social Services (DSS) to deliver a survivor-centered response to complaints of sexual assault or harassment made by a client or staff of a DSS or Department of Homeless (DHS) provider. DSS would be required to offer sexual assault and harassment resources to each survivor, follow-up with each survivor as appropriate and review each complaint to assess the next steps. The bill would require the Office to End Domestic and Gender-Based Violence to develop a survivor resource guide and provide the guide to DSS. DSS would be required to post the survivor guide and other training resources on its website, and make such materials available to contracted providers. The bill would further require DSS to review whether a provider has entered into a settlement in response to a complaint, or other actions taken in response to complaints. DSS would be required to submit an annual report to the Speaker of the Council on any steps taken to establish procedures pursuant to this bill. Finally, DHS would be required to provide resources, information, outreach materials and online training resources compiled by DSS to DHS’ contracted providers.",
