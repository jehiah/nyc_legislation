The proposed bill would require significant reforms to the program and the role of school safety agents (SSAs) by August 2021, so that SSAs no longer make arrests, carry weapons or mechanical restraints, or wear law enforcement uniforms on school grounds. Once under the jurisdiction of the Department of Education, school safety personnel would be retrained, with a focus on areas such as restorative justice, child and youth development, and de-escalation. The proposed bill would additionally expand quarterly reporting to require reporting on complaints made against SSAs and school safety personnel. The proposed bill would require the mayor, the police commissioner, and the DOE chancellor, by August 2021, to submit a plan for implementing the required transfer of all school safety or security functions from the NYPD to the DOE.","TextID":69664,"Text":"Int.
