  "Summary": "This bill would clarify Department of Buildings (“DOB”) enforcement requirements with respect to one- to four-family homes. This bill would allow DOB to issue a request corrective action in lieu of a notice of violation to one- and two-family homes, with some exceptions. This bill clarifies that the penalty issued for failure to submit a certification of correction of an immediately hazardous violation and the re-inspection requirement for such violation apply only at construction sites, and do not apply to one- to four-family homes.",

Section 28-219.2 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by chapter 250 of the laws of 2009 and renumbered by local law 51 for the year 2014, is amended to read as follows:\n� 28-219.2 Reinspection. Where an immediately hazardous condition at a construction site has been identified as posing a threat of imminent danger to public safety or property and a violation has been issued, the commissioner shall re-inspect the condition that gave rise to the violation within 60 days of the date of the notice of a violation, unless:\n1.
