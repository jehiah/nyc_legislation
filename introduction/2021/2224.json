  "Summary": "This bill would require the department of transportation to create a crash investigation and analysis unit tasked with investigating, analyzing and reporting on all vehicle crashes involving significant injury. In addition to its crash investigation functions, the unit created by this legislation would be required to make recommendations for safety-improving changes to street design and infrastructure, and to post reports regarding its crash reviews on the department of transportation website.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      Section 1. Subchapter 3 of chapter 1 of title 19 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 19-182.3 to read as follows: \n      � 19-182.3 Crash investigation and analysis unit. a. Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings: \n      Serious vehicular crash. The term \"serious vehicular crash\" means any collision between a motor vehicle and a pedestrian, cyclist, motorist or any other person that results in significant injury to or the death of any person. \n      Significant injury. The term \"significant injury\" means any injury categorized as an \"A\" injury by the New York state department of motor vehicles, or any injury which requires hospitalization, or any other injury as determined by the department.\n      b. Powers and duties. No later than January 1, 2022, the department shall establish a crash investigation and analysis unit, which shall have the duty to analyze and report on serious vehicular crashes. In coordination with the police department, such unit shall have all powers necessary to investigate serious vehicular crashes or any other crash, including but not limited to, inspecting crash sites, documenting vehicle and party positions, measuring and collecting data, interviewing witnesses, and conducting collision reconstructions. The unit shall also have the primary responsibility for all public statements, press releases or any other public communications regarding serious vehicular crashes and related investigations. Nothing contained in this subdivision shall be construed to inhibit or interfere with the ability of the police department to pursue criminal investigations, or as otherwise conflicting with any obligation under the vehicle and traffic law regarding the investigation of vehicle crashes.  \n      c. Review of street design. As part of any investigation undertaken pursuant to subdivision b of this section in which the department determines that street design or infrastructure contributed to a serious vehicular crash, the crash investigation and analysis unit shall review the existing street design, infrastructure and driver behavior at the location of each such crash, and as part of each such review, any available crash data or reports on locations with similar street design or infrastructure. In conducting the review, the unit may coordinate with the police department, the department of health and mental hygiene, the office of the chief medical examiner, or any other agency, office or organization deemed relevant by the department. Following each such review, the unit shall determine whether changes to street design or improvements to infrastructure could reduce the risk of subsequent serious vehicular crashes and make recommendations, if any, for safety maximizing changes to street design or infrastructure at the location of such crash, or citywide. \n      d. Reporting. No later than April 30, 2022, and every three months thereafter, the department shall post on its website a report with information on each investigation completed during the preceding three month period ending thirty days prior. Nothing contained in this subdivision shall be construed to inhibit or interfere with the ability of the police department to pursue criminal investigations, or as otherwise conflicting with any obligation under the vehicle and traffic law regarding the investigation of vehicle crashes. Furthermore, nothing required to be reported by this subdivision shall be reported in a manner that would reveal the identity of a person or persons involved in a serious vehicular crash. Each such report shall include, but need not be limited to, the following: \n      1. The total number of investigations completed; \n      2. All evidence and data collected pursuant to each investigation;\n      3. Determinations as to fault, including any potential criminal wrongdoing;\n      4. Any factors that may have contributed to each crash, or increased or mitigated the severity of each such crash; and\n      5. Whether changes to street design or improvements to infrastructure could reduce the risk of subsequent serious vehicular crashes, at each crash location or other similar locations, and a recommendation as to any such changes or improvements that should be made. \n      � 2. This local law takes effect immediately.\n \nEL\nLS 16854\n3/17/10:40PM\n2",
