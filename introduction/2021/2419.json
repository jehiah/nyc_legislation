Chapter 9 of title 21 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 21-918 to read as follows: \n      � 21-918 Children's center and temporary placement facility reporting. a. Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings:\n      Children's center.
