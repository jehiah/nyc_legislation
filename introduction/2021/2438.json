  "Summary": "This bill would expand upon CFB‚Äôs obligations when it comes to developing and publishing the voter guide. Specifically, the bill would require both the print and online voter guides to be published in English and in each of the top ten non-English languages spoken in New York City. In addition, the bill would require each online version of the voter guide to include a video statement from each candidate for Mayor, Comptroller, Public Advocate, Borough President, or City Council Member. Such videos would need to be made available with captioning and American Sign Language translation. Any candidate who participates in the public matching funds programs and does not create a candidate video for inclusion in the online voter guide would be subject to non-payment of 5% of their public matching funds.",
