  "Summary": "Pursuant to Local Law 152 of 2016 and Department of Buildings (DOB) rules, between January 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021, building gas piping systems must be inspected in community districts (CD) 2, 5, 7, 13, and 18 in all boroughs. DOB rules also require submission of a certification that all conditions identified in the inspection report have been corrected no later than 120 days or if more time is needed no later than 180 days following the inspection date. This bill would extend the December 31, 2021 inspection deadline for buildings in CD 2, 5, 7, 13, and 18 in all boroughs until June 30, 2022. The bill provides that for such buildings inspected between January 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021, the certification of correction may be submitted later than 120 days or later than 180 days following the inspection date, as applicable, but no later than June 30, 2022. This bill would also require DOB to conduct targeted outreach regarding complying with the requirements of Local Law 152 of 2016 by December 1, 2021.",
