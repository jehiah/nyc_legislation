  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Education (DOE) to publicly post, daily, on their website attendance data aggregated citywide and disaggregated by school for the previous day and previous week. The DOE is also required to publicly post, every two weeks, in the aggregate and disaggregated by school: * the number of students partially vaccinated for COVID-19 in attendance;  * the number of students fully and partially vaccinated for COVID-19;  * the number of COVID-19 testing consent forms received from families;  * the number of consent forms withdrawn; and * the number of unvaccinated students required to quarantine because of exposure in school to an individual who tested positive for COVID-19.  The data, to the extent such information is collected, would be disaggregated by grade level, gender, race or ethnicity, individualized education program status, English language learner status, status as a student residing in shelter and status as a student in temporary housing that is not a shelter.",
