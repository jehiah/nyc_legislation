  "Summary": "This bill would amend an existing law that prohibits third-party food delivery services - entities that provide food service establishments with online order and delivery services - from charging such establishments more than 15% per order for delivery and more than 5% per order for all other fees only when certain conditions apply. This bill would instead prohibit such charges from the anticipated end date of those conditions until February 17, 2022. It would also clarify the types of transaction fees exempted from these limits on charges.",
