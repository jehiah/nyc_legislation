  "Summary": "This bill would amend the City’s Earned Safe and Sick Time Act. Under the bill, an employee who is a parent or legal guardian of a child would be entitled to four hours of COVID-19 child vaccination time per vaccine injection for each child. The parent would be permitted to be absent to accompany their child to receive the vaccine, or care for the child due to side effects from the vaccine. COVID-19 child vaccination time would be paid at the employee’s regular rate of pay and would be in addition to the employee’s accrual or use of existing safe/sick time. It would be required to be paid by the next regular pay date. An employer could require that within seven days an employee provide documentation that their child was vaccinated. An employer could not require the employee to work additional hours to make up for the original hours the employee was unavailable, or find a replacement employee to cover the their hours, because the employee used COVID-19 child vaccination time. The bill’s requirements could not be waived, notwithstanding certain collective bargaining agreements. The bill would provide for relief and penalties for a failure to provide COVID-19 child vaccination time. It contains a 60-day phase-in period during which the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection would give written notice and a cure period before enforcing against employers who do not provide the new COVID-19 vaccination leave. The bill would expire and be deemed repealed on December 31, 2022.",

Where such need is not foreseeable, an employer may require an employee to provide notice of the need for the use of [safe/sick] such time as soon as practicable.\n            e. An employer shall not require an employee, as a condition of taking safe/sick time or COVID-19 child vaccination time, to search for or find a replacement worker to cover the hours during which such employee is utilizing time.\n            f. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit an employer from taking disciplinary action, up to and including termination, against a worker who uses safe/sick time provided pursuant to this chapter for purposes other than those described in this section or uses COVID-19 child vaccination time provided pursuant to this chapter for purposes other than those described in section 20-914.1.\n            � 4. Chapter 8 of title 20 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 20-914.1 to read as follows:\n            � 20-914.1 COVID-19 child vaccination time. a.

Accompanying such child to receive a COVID-19 vaccine injection; or \n            2.  Caring for such child who is experiencing temporary side effects from a COVID-19 vaccine injection.\n            b. COVID-19 child vaccination time shall be paid at an employee's regular rate of pay at the time the time is taken, provided that the rate of pay shall not be less than the highest applicable rate of pay to which the employee would be entitled pursuant to subdivision 1 of section 652 of the labor law, or any other applicable federal, state, or local law, rule, contract, or agreement. Such rate of pay shall be calculated without allowing for any tip credit or tip allowance set forth in any federal, state, or local law, rule, contract, or agreement and shall not be charged against an employee's accrual or use of safe/sick time under this chapter. COVID-19 child vaccination time must be paid no later than the payday for the next regular payroll period beginning after the COVID-19 child vaccination time was used by the employee.\n            c. An employer may require that within seven days of an employee's use of COVID-19 child vaccination time, the employee provide reasonable documentation that the child for whose care the COVID-19 vaccine time is claimed has received a COVID-19 vaccine injection. \n            d.  An employer shall not require an employee to work additional hours to make up for the original hours for which such employee was absent or to search for or find a replacement employee to cover the hours during which the employee is absent pursuant to this section. \n            � 5. Section 20-916 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new subdivision c to read as follows:\n            c. Notwithstanding subdivisions a and b of this section, the requirement to provide COVID-19 child vaccination time as set forth in section 20-914.1 cannot be waived. \n            � 6.
