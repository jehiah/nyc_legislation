  "Summary": "This bill would require applicants seeking to rent out rooms in dwelling units, or housing accommodations within a building, for fewer than 30 consecutive days, as short-term rentals, to register annually with the Mayor’s Office of Special Enforcement and obtain a registration number before being permitted to rent out rooms in such a manner. Booking services would be required to obtain a registration from the Mayor’s Office of Special Enforcement and verify the short-term rental registration number of any accommodation before listing it on their service.",
