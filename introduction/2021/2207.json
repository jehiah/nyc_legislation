Investigations shall be undertaken at least once a year and more often if necessary, such as when, in the exercise of reasonable care, an owner knows or should have known of a condition that is reasonably foreseeable to cause an indoor allergen hazard, or an occupant makes a complaint concerning a condition that is likely to cause an indoor allergen hazard or requests an inspection, or the department issues a notice of violation or orders the correction of a violation that is likely to cause an indoor allergen hazard. An occupant may request postponement of such an investigation during the state of emergency declared by the mayor in response to the 2019 novel coronavirus and for up to one year after such state of emergency is lifted; however, an owner is not relieved of the requirement to cause an investigation to be made absent such a request for postponement by an occupant.\n      � 2.
