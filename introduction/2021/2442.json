  "Summary": "This bill would require the Mayor to establish an Office of Community Mental Health (OCMH) within the Executive Office of the Mayor, or as a separate office, or within any other agency or office headed by a mayoral appointee. OCMH would be charged with the following duties and operations: request and receive the assistance of any other agency or office; develop and support the implementation of strategies to close gaps in mental health care; develop interagency policies and practices to promote mental health; decrease any barriers to mental health care that may prevent access among groups identified as being under-served; and perform any other relevant duties as the mayor may assign. Additionally, OCMH would be responsible to ensure interagency coordination with DOHMH or any other office or agency. This bill would also require the establishment of a Mental Health Council to advise OCMH on issues relating to mental health and mental health care and facilitate coordination and cooperation among city agencies. Finally, OCMH would be required to annually report to the Mayor and Speaker of the Council, and post to OCMH’s website, a report identifying critical gaps in mental health care that are preventing New Yorkers with mental health needs from accessing and staying connected to care.",
