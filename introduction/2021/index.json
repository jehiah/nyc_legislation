DOB rules also require submission of a certification that all conditions identified in the inspection report have been corrected no later than 120 days, or if more time is needed, no later than 180 days following the inspection date. Although a late certification is permitted when additional time for a correction is needed, where a property owner is unable to timely complete an inspection, there is no way for the property owner to seek an extension of time to complete the inspection. In addition, a property owner is required to have gas piping in their building inspected, even if the building does not have active gas service. This bill would allow a property owner of a building with gas piping but not active gas service to forego their gas piping inspection so long as they provide certification from their utility company and themselves that there is no active gas service in their building.  If they resume gas service they must obtain a certificate of approval of gas installation from DOB and comply with the gas piping inspection and certification requirements of local Law 152.  This bill also allows DOB to grant additional time to submit a certification, beyond 180 days, if additional time is needed to ameliorate conditions that must be corrected. Finally, this bill provides a 180 day extension to comply with both the inspection and certification requirements of Local Law 152 for any building owner who requests an extension.","LastModified":"2021-11-22T23:14:44.19Z"}
