Once under the jurisdiction of the Department of Education, school safety personnel would be retrained, with a focus on areas such as restorative justice, child and youth development, and de-escalation. The proposed bill would additionally expand quarterly reporting to require reporting on complaints made against SSAs and school safety personnel.

DOB rules also require submission of a certification that all conditions identified in the inspection report have been corrected no later than 120 days, or if more time is needed, no later than 180 days following the inspection date. Although a late certification is permitted when additional time for a correction is needed, where a property owner is unable to timely complete an inspection, there is no way for the property owner to seek an extension of time to complete the inspection. In addition, a property owner is required to have gas piping in their building inspected, even if the building does not have active gas service. This bill would allow a property owner of a building with gas piping but not active gas service to forego their gas piping inspection so long as they provide certification from their utility company and themselves that there is no active gas service in their building.  If they resume gas service they must obtain a certificate of approval of gas installation from DOB and comply with the gas piping inspection and certification requirements of local Law 152.  This bill also allows DOB to grant additional time to submit a certification, beyond 180 days, if additional time is needed to ameliorate conditions that must be corrected. Finally, this bill provides a 180 day extension to comply with both the inspection and certification requirements of Local Law 152 for any building owner who requests an extension.","LastModified":"2021-11-22T23:14:44.19Z"}

This requirement would apply through December 31, 2024.  Covered employers would include airport hospitality operations, airport service providers, food service contractors and restaurants and private entities whose employees are regularly scheduled to work at event centers. The bill also defines a laid-off employee to include an employee who was employed by a covered employer for six months or more between January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2020, and whose most recent separation from employment (i) was initiated by the covered employer, (ii) occurred after January 31, 2020 and before January 1, 2022 and (iii) was due to a government order, layoff, lack of business, reduction in force or other economic, non-disciplinary reason.  Covered employers would be required to offer employees who were laid-off with available positions for which they are qualified before they can hire new employees, ensuring that such laid-offs employees have priority to return to work. Laid-off employees would have 10 days to accept or decline the offer of employment. Covered employers would also be required to provide laid-off employees with a notice of their right to recall under this legislation. The requirements of the bill would be enforceable by workers through a private right of action in civil court, including reasonable attorney’s fees and costs if the employee prevails.","LastModified":"2021-12-07T15:58:04.647Z"}

With some exceptions, the bill would mandate that if 5,000 or more New York residents must be notified at one time pursuant to Section 10-502 of the City’s Administrative Code, the notifying agency must also notify consumer reporting agencies as to the timing, content and distribution of the notices, and approximate number of affected individuals. Certain agencies would have to coordinate and keep records on data breaches. The bill would mandate that Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and Taxi and Limousine Commission licensees required to make a data breach notification pursuant to State law, promptly submit a copy of the notification to their licensing agencies.","LastModified":"2021-12-13T15:21:02.477Z"}

This bill authorizes the Department of Housing Preservation and Development to enforce the affordable housing provisions placed within its responsibility in the Zoning Resolution, and provides procedures by which enforcement is to take place.

Under the bill, an employee who is a parent or legal guardian of a child would be entitled to four hours of COVID-19 child vaccination time per vaccine injection for each child. The parent would be permitted to be absent to accompany their child to receive the vaccine, or care for the child due to side effects from the vaccine. COVID-19 child vaccination time would be paid at the employee’s regular rate of pay and would be in addition to the employee’s accrual or use of existing safe/sick time. It would be required to be paid by the next regular pay date. An employer could require that within seven days an employee provide documentation that their child was vaccinated. An employer could not require the employee to work additional hours to make up for the original hours the employee was unavailable, or find a replacement employee to cover the their hours, because the employee used COVID-19 child vaccination time. The bill’s requirements could not be waived, notwithstanding certain collective bargaining agreements. The bill would provide for relief and penalties for a failure to provide COVID-19 child vaccination time. It contains a 60-day phase-in period during which the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection would give written notice and a cure period before enforcing against employers who do not provide the new COVID-19 vaccination leave. The bill would expire and be deemed repealed on December 31, 2022.","LastModified":"2021-12-12T19:49:00.6Z"}
