  "Summary": "This bill would prohibit the combustion of substances with certain emissions profiles in buildings within the City. This bill would also direct the Commissioner of Buildings to deny construction documents and permits in connection with a building that would require the combustion of these substances, with some exceptions. This bill would further require the Mayor‚Äôs Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability to conduct two studies: (1) a study regarding the use of heat pump technology; and (2) a study of the impact of this bill on the City‚Äôs electrical grid.",

Subchapter 8 of chapter 1 of title 24 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 24-177.1 to read as follows:\n      ÔøΩ 24-177.1 Prohibited emissions a. Buildings shall be subject to the emission limits set forth in this section in accordance with section 28-506.1.\n      b. No person shall permit the combustion of any substance that emits 25 kilograms or more of carbon dioxide per million British thermal units of energy, as determined by the United States energy information administration, within such building. \n      c. Notwithstanding the prohibition in subdivision b, combustion of a substance that emits 25 kilograms of carbon dioxide per million British thermal units of energy or more shall be permitted for use within such a building where the combustion of such substance occurs in connection with a device that contains no connection to a building's gas supply line or fuel oil piping system, is used on an intermittent basis, and is not used to supply a building with heat or hot water.\n      d. This section may be enforced by the department or the department of buildings.\n\tÔøΩ 2.
