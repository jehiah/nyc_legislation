  "Summary": "This bill would prohibit the combustion of substances with certain emissions profiles in buildings within the City. This bill would also direct the Commissioner of Buildings to deny construction documents and permits in connection with a building that would require the combustion of these substances, with some exceptions. This bill would further require the Mayor’s Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability to conduct two studies: (1) a study regarding the use of heat pump technology; and (2) a study of the impact of this bill on the City’s electrical grid.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Subchapter 8 of chapter 1 of title 24 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 24-177.1 to read as follows:\n      � 24-177.1 Prohibited emissions a. Buildings shall be subject to the emission limits set forth in this section in accordance with section 28-506.1.\n      b. No person shall permit the combustion of any substance that emits 25 kilograms or more of carbon dioxide per million British thermal units of energy, as determined by the United States energy information administration, within such building. \n      c. Notwithstanding the prohibition in subdivision b, combustion of a substance that emits 25 kilograms of carbon dioxide per million British thermal units of energy or more shall be permitted for use within such a building where the combustion of such substance occurs in connection with a device that contains no connection to a building's gas supply line or fuel oil piping system, is used on an intermittent basis, and is not used to supply a building with heat or hot water.\n      d. This section may be enforced by the department or the department of buildings.\n\t� 2.  The table of civil penalties following subparagraph (i) of paragraph (3) of subdivision (a) of section 24-178 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new row in numerical order to read as follows:\n24-177.1\n$400\n$4,000\n      \n      � 3.

New buildings shall be subject to the emissions limits set forth in section 24-177.1. The commissioner shall not approve an application for the approval of construction documents, nor issue any permit in connection therewith, for a new building that does not comply with section 24-177.1.\n\nExceptions: \n      \n1. A building that is seven stories or more where an application for the approval of construction documents is submitted on or before July 1, 2027.\n\n2. A building that is less than seven stories where an application for the approval of construction documents is submitted on or before December 31, 2023. \n\n3. A building, other than a building, that is classified as group R-3, where such emissions are in connection with the provision of hot water and an application for the approval of construction documents is submitted on or before July 1, 2027.\n\n4. A building that is less than seven stories where the building owner demonstrates in accordance with rules promulgated by the department that 50 percent or more of the dwelling units in such building are subject to a regulatory agreement, restrictive declaration, or similar instrument with a federal, state, or local governmental entity or instrumentality for the creation or preservation of affordable housing, and an application for the approval of construction documents is submitted before December 31, 2025.\n\n5.

An application filed by or on behalf of the school construction authority submitted before December 31, 2024.\n\n9. A building where it would not be required to comply with section 24-177.1 because the combustion of a substance that emits 25 kg or more of carbon dioxide per million British thermal units of energy is necessary for a manufacturing use or purpose, or for the operation of a laboratory, laundromat, hospital, crematorium, commercial kitchen as defined in section 602 of the New York city fire code, or where used for emergency or standby power, or other use allowed by rule of the department, to the extent necessary for, and in the space occupied by such use or purpose.\n      \n      � 4. a. The office of long-term planning and sustainability, in consultation with other relevant agencies or offices of the city, and with experts in the operation of heat pumps, engineers and architects, shall conduct a study regarding the use of heat pump technology in relation to the anticipated use of such technology in connection with the implementation of this local law. Such study may reference, or draw from, data collected during, or the results of, prior studies. Such study shall include, but need not be limited to, evaluations of the feasibility within the city, the feasibility based on building size for buildings less than seven stories and for buildings seven stories and more, cost of installation based on building size for buildings less than seven stories and for buildings seven stories and more, cost of use based on building size for buildings less than seven stories and for buildings seven stories and more, and environmental impact of the use of the following technologies: \n      1.
