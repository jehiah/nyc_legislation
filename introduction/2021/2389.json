  "Summary": "This bill would prohibit discrimination on the basis of a person’s actual or perceived height or weight in relation to opportunities of employment, housing, and access to public accommodations. This bill would also create an exemption for employers needing to consider height or weight in employment decisions only where height or weight is a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the business and would also exempt operators or providers of public accommodations only where height or weight requirements would qualify as bona fide considerations of public health and safety.",

The council hereby finds and declares that prejudice, intolerance, bigotry, and discrimination, bias-related violence or harassment and disorder occasioned thereby threaten the rights and proper privileges of its inhabitants and menace the institutions and foundation of a free democratic state.
