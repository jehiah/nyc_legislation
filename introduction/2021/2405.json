  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Social Services (DSS) to consider the time a youth has spent in a runaway and homeless youth shelter as “homelessness” when determining whether that youth is eligible for rental assistance through CityFHEPS. This bill would also preclude DSS from requiring such youth to live outside of a youth shelter as a condition of eligibility.",
