  "Summary": "This bill would allow youth who have spent time in runaway and homeless youth services funded by the Department of Youth and Community Development (DYCD) to be eligible for CityFHEPS rental assistance vouchers. Any 90 days of the previous two years spent in these services would count as time spent in shelter for purposes of determining eligibility for the vouchers. The provision of vouchers to such individuals would be subject to appropriation.",
