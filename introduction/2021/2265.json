  "Summary": "This bill would amend the Housing Maintenance Code by requiring owners of units in multiple dwellings to provide to tenants with either permanent stove safety knobs with integrated locking mechanisms or stove knob covers for each knob located on the front of each gas-powered stove at the owner’s option.  This bill would also require owners of such units to keep a record of outreach to tenants regarding the installation of permanent stove safety knobs with integrated locking mechanism or stove knob covers.",

Such permanent stove safety knobs with integrated locking mechanisms or stove knob covers shall be made available within [thirty] 30 days of such owner providing the notice required in subdivision b of this section unless such owner has previously made such permanent stove safety knobs with integrated locking mechanisms or stove knob covers available to the tenant and the tenant has not requested a replacement.\n      b. 1. Such owner shall provide an annual notice to each tenant of a unit regarding the owner's obligation to provide permanent stove safety knobs with integrated locking mechanisms or stove knob covers pursuant to subdivision a of this section. Such notice shall inform the tenant of [his or her] the tenant's option to refuse permanent stove safety knobs with integrated locking mechanisms or stove knob covers.\n      2. Upon being provided with such notice, a tenant may notify such owner, in writing, that such tenant refuses permanent stove safety knobs with integrated locking mechanisms or stove knob covers.

The owner may satisfy a tenant's request by supplying either stove safety knobs with integrated locking mechanisms or stove knob covers. \n      d. Any owner who is required to provide permanent stove safety knobs with integrated locking mechanisms or stove knob covers pursuant to this section who fails to do so shall be liable for a class B hazardous violation, provided that it shall be an exception to a violation where (i) the owner provides documented proof that there is no available permanent stove safety knob with an integrated locking mechanism or stove knob cover that is compatible with [the knobs on] such stove or (ii) the owner has already fulfilled two requests for replacement permanent stove safety knobs with integrated locking mechanisms or stove knob covers within the previous year.\n      � 2.
