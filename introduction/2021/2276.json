This includes sites that are required to designate a Construction Superintendent, Site Safety Coordinator, or Site Safety Manager. This decrease in injuries also coincides with the implementation of Local Law 196 of 2017, which requires safety training for workers and supervisors at larger construction sites. This bill seeks to build on efforts to reduce construction-related injuries and fatalities by requiring additional site safety supervision at major building construction sites. Such sites would be required to designate a full time Construction Superintendent, who would be responsible for safety and code compliance, along with overall management of the construction project, in addition to a Site Safety Coordinator or Site Safety Manager.","TextID":69934,"Text":"Int.
