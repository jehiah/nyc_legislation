  "Summary": "This bill would require the New York city housing authority (NYCHA) report to the Mayor’s Office of Long Term Planning and Stability (OLTPS) the amount of greenhouse gas emissions for the portfolio of buildings owned or operated by NYCHA by December 1, 2022, and no later than every December 1 thereafter, for the prior calendar year. Further, the Mayor shall include in the annual report on green building standards, due by December 1 each year, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions from capital projects involving buildings that are owned or operated by NYCHA, measured in carbon dioxide equivalent for the fiscal year ending in the previous calendar year, and the percentage change in such emissions measured in carbon dioxide equivalent for such calendar year, relative to such emissions for calendar year 2005. This bill would also amend the reporting date required by Local Law 22 of 2008 of inventory and analysis of citywide emissions and city government emissions, measured in carbon dioxide equivalent for the previous calendar year. The reporting date will be amended from September 17 to November 15 of each year.  The bill would also amend the reporting date of relevant actions taken by OLTPS, including programs developed and education and outreach activities, from September 17 to November 15 of each year.  Finally, within 90 days after the adoption of the capital budget, the bill would require the OLTPS to complete and post on its website a list of current and future capital projects intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from city government operations.",
