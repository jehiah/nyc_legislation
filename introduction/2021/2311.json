The information would consist of the customer’s name, phone number, e-mail address, delivery address and the contents of their orders, as described in Proposed Int. No. 2335-A. Customers would be able to opt out of the sharing of this information, and the service would be required to provide a clear disclosure to customers explaining what information would be shared with the establishment. The establishment fulfilling the customer’s order would be permitted to retain that information, which must be provided in a machine-readable format. Services could not limit the establishments’ use of the information, but the bill would prohibit the establishments from selling, renting or disclosing the information without express consent from the customer, and the customer would be able to withdraw their consent to using their information. The bill would also permit customers to request that the establishment delete their information.","TextID":70420,"Text":"Int.
