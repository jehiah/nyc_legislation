  "Summary": "The bill would establish a local right of security against unreasonable search and seizure and against excessive force regardless of whether such force is used in connection with a search or seizure. If an NYPD employee, or a person appointed by the Police Commissioner as a special patrolman, allegedly deprives a person of this right, the person would be able to bring a civil action against the employee or appointee, as well as against the employee or appointee’s employer, within three years after deprivation of the right. The employee or appointee (or their employer) would not be allowed qualified immunity, or any substantially equivalent immunity, as a defense. The Law Department would be required to post details of these kinds of civil actions online.",

Title 8 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new chapter 8 to read as follows:\n      CHAPTER 8\n      THE RIGHT OF SECURITY AGAINST UNREASONABLE SEARCH AND SEIZURE AND AGAINST EXCESSIVE FORCE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH FORCE IS USED IN CONNECTION WITH A SEARCH OR SEIZURE\n      \n      � 8-801 Definitions.\n� 8-802 Right of security against unreasonable search and seizure and against excessive force regardless of whether such force is used in connection with a search or seizure.\n      � 8-803 Civil action for deprivation of rights.\n      � 8-804 Immunity not a defense.\n      � 8-805 Relief.\n      � 8-806 Statute of limitations.\n      � 8-807 Construction.\n      \n      � 8-801 Definitions. For purposes of this chapter, the following terms have the following meanings:\n      Covered individual.

The term \"prevailing plaintiff\" has the meaning ascribed to such term in subdivision g of section 8-502.\n      State. The term \"state\" means the state of New York.\n      � 8-802 Right of security against unreasonable search and seizure and against excessive force regardless of whether such force is used in connection with a search or seizure.

A covered individual who, under color of any law, ordinance, rule, regulation, custom or usage, subjects or causes to be subjected, including through failure to intervene, any other natural person to the deprivation of any right that is created, granted or protected by section 8-802 is liable to the person aggrieved for legal or equitable relief or any other appropriate relief.\n      b. The employer of a covered individual who, under color of any law, ordinance, rule, regulation, custom or usage, subjects or causes to be subjected, including through failure to intervene, any other natural person to the deprivation of any right that is created, granted or protected by section 8-802 is liable, based upon the conduct of such covered individual, to the person aggrieved for legal or equitable relief or any other appropriate relief.\n      c.

This section does not limit or abrogate any claim or cause of action a person aggrieved has under common law or pursuant to any other law or rule. Despite the availability of an alternative remedy under common law or pursuant to any other law or rule, the person aggrieved has and maintains a private right of action pursuant to this section. Exhaustion of any administrative remedies is not required for a person aggrieved to commence a civil action pursuant to this section.

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in section 50-k of the general municipal law or any other provision of law, a person aggrieved must make a claim pursuant to section 8-803 in a civil action within 3 years after the alleged deprivation of a right created, granted or protected by section 8-802 occurred.\n      � 8-807 Construction. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter and notwithstanding section 8-130, (i) the right against unreasonable search and seizure, including excessive force used in connection with a search or seizure, created, granted or protected by section 8-802 shall be construed in the same manner as the right against unreasonable search and seizure, including excessive force used in connection with a search or seizure, created, granted or protected by the fourth amendment of the federal constitution, section 12 of article I of the state constitution and section 8 of the civil rights law and (ii) the right against excessive force, other than excessive force used in connection with a search or seizure, created, granted or protected by section 8-802 shall be construed in the same manner as the right against excessive force, other than excessive force used in connection with a search or seizure, created, granted or protected by the fourteenth amendment of the federal constitution and section 6 of article I of the state constitution.\n      � 2. Section 7-114 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 166 for the year 2017, is amended to read as follows:\n      � 7-114 Civil actions regarding the police department and covered individuals. a.
