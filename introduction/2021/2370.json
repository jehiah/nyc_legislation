  "Summary": "This bill would require that the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene undertake a public education campaign in facilities that provide obstetric and gynecological care through the Department to inform patients about the city standards for respectful care at birth, health care proxy forms, the right to be free from discrimination related to pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition, the right to be free from discrimination due to caregiver status, the right to reasonable accommodations in the workplace including lactation accommodations, paid sick and safe leave, temporary schedule changes, temporary disability insurance, the family and medical leave act of 1993 and New York’s paid family leave program. The campaign would distribute posters, flyers, forms and other written material to patients. The bill would also invite the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation to distribute and post such materials at locations under its jurisdiction.",
