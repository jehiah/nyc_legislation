  "Summary": "This bill would require certain businesses that supply their employees to clients for the performance of construction work or manual labor on the client’s construction site, in exchange for compensation, to be licensed. The term “construction” in this bill explicitly excludes handyman work.  Applying for a license would require certain signed statements and select information on business operations, and each covered business would have to supply their workers with a series of notices: on their rights as workers covered by this bill; training and certifications the employees would need to perform their work duties; and information on the employees’ work assignments. The businesses’ clients would also receive some of these notices, and these clients could be subject to civil penalties if they use the services of an unlicensed business that is required to be licensed by this bill. Businesses that violate the bill’s subchapter would also be subject to penalties. \r\nEmployees of the businesses aggrieved by a violation of the bill’s subchapter would be able to initiate a private right of action against their employers for violations of the bill, including for retaliation against employees for availing themselves of rights provided by this bill.",

As a condition of hire by such construction labor provider; or\n      2.

For contracts offered by a third party client less than 24 hours prior to the requested time of dispatch, a construction labor provider shall provide a notice of assignment to a covered construction worker within 72 hours. Where such assignment is completed prior to 72 hours from the requested time of dispatch, no such notice is required.  \n      3. If any of the information required to be provided by paragraph one of this subdivision changes, such construction labor provider shall update such covered construction worker in writing within 24 hours of such construction labor provider being informed of the change.\n      d. Every construction labor provider shall provide to the third party client on each project for which covered construction workers have been contracted to work, and the owner of the property where work is being performed, as applicable, a copy of the information required by subdivisions a and c of this section, no later than seven days after the day on which such construction labor provider first dispatched a covered construction worker to a worksite for a third party client. Such construction labor provider shall additionally furnish such information upon such third party client's request at any time for the duration of the project. The third party client shall provide written acknowledgment of receipt of such information.\n      e.

A construction labor provider shall notify each covered construction worker it employs and each third party client with whom it has a contract of all final violations or penalties issued against such construction labor provider by the department or the office of administrative trials and hearings for violations of this subchapter, within 90 days of such issuance.\n      � 20-564.3 Records. Every construction labor provider shall keep on file in its principal place of business for a period of three years the following records:\n      a. Statements signed by each covered construction worker, in the language identified by each covered construction worker as their primary language, indicating that the covered construction worker received, read and understood the notices required to be provided to them pursuant to section 20-564.2 of this subchapter;\n      b. All records necessary to verify the information reported in sections 20-564.1 and 20-564.2 of this subchapter; and\n      c. Such other records as the commissioner may prescribe by rule.\nAll records required by this section or by the commissioner by rule shall be made available to the department electronically upon request, consistent with applicable law and in accordance with rules promulgated hereunder and with appropriate notice.\n      � 20-564.4 Third party clients. It is unlawful for a third party client to accept the services of a covered construction worker provided by a construction labor provider that is not licensed pursuant to this subchapter, if the provision of such services by such construction labor provider would require such a license. A construction labor provider shall provide each of its third party clients with a copy of their license issued by the department upon such client's request. If a third party client accepts the services of a construction labor provider who is not licensed but demonstrates the receipt of information from the construction labor provider or the department that inaccurately represents such provider as licensed, such client shall be held harmless. Each violation of this section shall subject a third party client to a civil penalty not to exceed $500. Each day during which a third party client accepts the services of a covered construction worker in violation of this section shall constitute a separate and distinct offense.\n      � 20-564.5 Enforcement. a. Any person operating as a construction labor provider without a license issued by the commissioner pursuant to this subchapter shall be liable for a civil penalty of $500 per day for every calendar day during which the unlicensed construction labor provider operated. A construction labor provider that violates section 20-564.2 or any rule promulgated thereunder shall be liable for a civil penalty of $250 for a first violation, and $500 for each subsequent violation within one year of the first violation. Each covered construction worker or third party client for whom the construction labor provider did not provide a notification in accordance with such section shall constitute a separate and distinct offense. Such penalties shall be in addition to any other civil or criminal penalties that may be applicable under any other law, rule or regulation.\n      b. Any action or proceeding that may be appropriate or necessary for the correction of any violation issued pursuant to this subchapter, including, but not limited to, actions to secure permanent injunctions, enjoining any acts or practices which constitute such violation, mandating compliance with the provisions of this subchapter, seeking civil penalties for violations of this subchapter, or such other relief as may be appropriate, may be initiated in any court of competent jurisdiction by the corporation counsel or such other persons designated by the corporation counsel.\n      � 20-564.6 Private right of action. Any covered construction worker who is aggrieved by a violation of this subchapter may commence an action in a court of competent jurisdiction on their own behalf against a construction labor provider. For each violation of section 20-564.2, the covered construction worker may recover damages of $500. If such violation of 20-564.2 was committed with intent or recklessness, the covered construction worker may recover damages of $1,000. Any person who is a victim of retaliation shall be entitled to all relief necessary to make such person whole, including, but not limited to: (i) an injunction to restrain any adverse or retaliatory action; (ii) reinstatement to the position such officer or employee would have had but for such action, or to an equivalent position; and (iii) reinstatement of full benefits and seniority rights including payment of any missed back pay, plus interest. Persons aggrieved by a violation of section 20-564.2 or by retaliation shall be entitled to compensation for any special damages sustained as a result of an action commenced pursuant to this section, including litigation costs and reasonable attorneys' fees; and to relief other than set forth in this section as the court may deem appropriate.\n      � 2. Any applicant for a construction labor provider license pursuant to this local law that is engaging in business as a construction labor provider on the date this local law is enacted shall provide the information required in paragraph 3 of subdivision c of section 20-564.1 as part of their initial application for such license. For information that such paragraph requires to be provided with respect to \"the preceding licensing term,\" such construction labor provider shall instead provide such information for the time period from the date this local law is enacted until the date the application for the initial license is submitted.\n      � 3. Section 1 of this local law takes effect 180 days after it becomes law. Section 2 of this local law takes effect immediately.\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSJ\nLS #17096\n11/1/21 7:39 PM\n\n\n      1\n      \n      \n      1",
