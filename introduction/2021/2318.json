These businesses would be required to provide their employees with a summary of their rights under city, state and federal employment laws and with information on their next work assignment at least 24 hours prior to beginning work. The businesses would additionally have to disclose data on their company, workforce, worksites, and workers’ compensation and unemployment insurance information to the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection twice per year. That information would be supplied to the Council and the Mayor yearly, and published on the Department’s website. The bill would also make it unlawful for clients of these businesses to contract with them if such businesses are unlicensed. Employees who avail themselves of their rights under this bill would be protected against retaliation. Violations of the bill could result in license suspension and revocation, civil penalties and other enforcement actions ordered by a court. Employees of the businesses would be able to initiate a private right of action against their employers for violations of the bill.","TextID":70188,"Text":"Int.

Any action or proceeding that may be appropriate or necessary for the correction of any violation issued pursuant to this subchapter, including, but not limited to, actions to secure permanent injunctions, enjoining any acts or practices which constitute such violation, mandating compliance with the provisions of this subchapter or such other relief as may be appropriate, may be initiated in any court of competent jurisdiction by the corporation counsel or such other persons designated by the corporation counsel on behalf of the commissioner.\n      � 20-563.8 Private right of action.
