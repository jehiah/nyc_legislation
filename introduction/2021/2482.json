  "Summary": "This bill would limit increases of occupancy fees for self-storage facilities so that the occupancy fee for a self-storage unit occupied continuously by the same occupant could not increase by more than two percent per year. In addition, storage facilities would not be permitted to terminate occupancies for any reason other than non-payment of required fees. Violations of the prohibitions in this bill would be subject to civil penalties of up to $2,500 per year per storage unit. The Corporation Counsel would be empowered to enforce the bill’s provisions by instituting a civil action against any self-storage facility in violation, and by conducting an investigation pursuant to such civil action.",
