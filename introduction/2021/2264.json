Dissimilar metals shall not be used in direct contact with cold-formed steel framing members unless approved for that application by the registered design professional of record for the cold-formed steel framing system.\n2.  Cold-formed steel framing members shall not be embedded in concrete unless approved for that application by the registered design professional of record for the cold-formed steel framing system.\n3.  Fasteners shall have a corrosion-resistant treatment, or be manufactured from material not susceptible to corrosion.\n4. Welded connections shall be protected with a treatment, approved by the registered design professional of record for the cold-formed steel framing system, to retain corrosion resistance of the welded area.\n3305.6.4 Screw connections. Screw fasteners in cold-formed steel structural members shall extend through the steel connection with a minimum of three exposed threads.\n3305.6.4.1 Stripped screws in direct tension prohibited. Stripped screws in direct tension shall not be permitted.\n3305.6.4.2 Stripped screws in shear connections.

Framing and decking, whether temporary or permanent, shall be designed to sustain all anticipated loads to be imposed by construction activity, including construction loads, concentrated loading caused by material delivery, and loads generated by the movement of material and equipment.\n3305.6.6.5 Bracing and shoring for temporary loading areas.  Bracing and shoring shall be provided for all temporary loading areas and shall be designed to support the maximum load allowed in the temporary loading area.  In no case shall the required shoring be designed for a construction load of less than 100 psf.  Bracing and shoring shall ultimately bear upon permanent structure or earth capable of sustaining the loads transmitted.  The design shall also specify the criteria for the removal of any temporary bracing or shoring.\n3305.6.6.6 Floor joists to be braced prior to installation of decking.

Immediately prior to the placement of any person, material, or equipment on a section of cold-formed steel framing for the first time, or on a section of decking on cold-formed steel framing for the first time, a competent person designated by the construction superintendent, or where the project does not require a construction superintendent, a competent person designated by the permit holder, shall determine that the structure is ready to receive the person, material, or equipment by performing an inspection that:\n1.  Verifies compliance with applicable drawings, specifications, and regulations, including but not limited to the approved construction documents, the erection drawings, the manufacturer specifications, and the requirements of Section 3305.6;\n2.  Ascertains the weight of the material or equipment to be placed, and determines it does not exceed that specified in the drawings required by Section 3305.6.6.1;\n3.

Verifies compliance with the requirements of Sections 3305.6.7.1 through 3305.6.7.4.\n3305.6.7.6.1 Record of designation of competent person. The designation of the competent person required by Section 3305.6.7.6 shall be recorded in the construction superintendent's log required by Section 3301.13.13, or where the project does not require a construction superintendent, the designation of the competent person shall be documented in the form of a notarized letter on the letterhead of the permit holder.  The record letter shall state the name and contact information of the competent person,  the date of designation, and shall be signed and dated by the permit holder, the competent person and the person who designated the competent person.\n3305.6.7.6.2 Record of inspection. The results of the inspection shall be documented in accordance with the checklist required by Section 3305.6.8.\n3305.6.7.6.3 Does not diminish responsibility. The designation of a competent person does not alter or diminish any obligation imposed upon the construction superintendent or the permit holder to maintain a safe site and ensure compliance with the requirements of this code.\n3305.6.8 Inspection checklist. The results of the verification inspections required by Sections 3305.6.6.8, 3305.6.7.5, and 3305.6.7.6 shall be documented on a verification inspection checklist signed and dated by the person who performed the inspection.  The verification inspection checklist shall be developed by the designer who prepared the drawings required by Section 3305.6.6.1.\n      ï¿½3. This local law shall take effect 120 days after it becomes law. This local law shall not apply to applications for construction document approval filed prior to such effective date, except that it shall apply to permits issued prior to such effective date upon renewal. The commissioner of buildings may take such measures as are necessary for the implementation of this local law, including the promulgation of rules, prior to such effective date.\n\n- 1 -",
