  "Summary": "This bill would amend the City’s data breach notification laws to align them with requirements in New York’s SHIELD Act. It would make certain definitions in City law more consistent with State law. City agencies that have suffered a security breach involving persons’ private identifying information would be required to promptly disclose it to the City’s Chief Privacy Officer, the Office of Cyber Command, and the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications; formerly the NYPD received this type of disclosure. The obligation to make this type of disclosure – including to affected persons – would be expanded to situations in which the information was reasonably believed to have been accessed, disclosed or used by an unauthorized person. With some exceptions, the bill would mandate that if 5,000 or more New York residents must be notified at one time pursuant to Section 10-502 of the City’s Administrative Code, the notifying agency must also notify consumer reporting agencies as to the timing, content and distribution of the notices, and approximate number of affected individuals. Certain agencies would have to coordinate and keep records on data breaches. The bill would mandate that Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and Taxi and Limousine Commission licensees required to make a data breach notification pursuant to State law, promptly submit a copy of the notification to their licensing agencies.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Section 10-501 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 45 for the year 2005, is amended to read as follows: \n      � 10-501. Definitions. For the purposes of this chapter,\n      a. The term [\"personal identifying information\" shall mean any person's date of birth, social security number, driver's license number, non-driver photo identification card number, financial services account number or code, savings account number or code, checking account number or code, brokerage account number or code, credit card account number or code, debit card number or code, automated teller machine number or code, personal identification number, mother's maiden name, computer system password, electronic signature or unique biometric data that is a fingerprint, voice print, retinal image or iris image of another person. This term shall apply to all such data, notwithstanding the method by which such information is maintained.] \"personal information\" shall mean any information concerning an individual that because of a name, number, symbol, mark or other identifier, can be used to identify that individual. \n      b. The term \"private information\" shall mean either: (i) personal information consisting of any information in combination with any one or more of the following data elements, when either the data element alone or the combination of such information plus the data element is not encrypted, or encrypted with an encryption key that has also been accessed or acquired:\n      (1) social security number;\n      (2) driver's license number or non-driver identification card number;\n      (3) account number, credit or debit card number, in combination with any required security code, access code, password or other information which would permit access to an individual's financial account;\n      (4) account number, or credit or debit card number, if circumstances exist wherein such number could be used to access an individual's financial account without additional identifying information, security code, access code, or password; or\n      (5) biometric information, meaning data generated by electronic measurements of an individual's unique physical characteristics, such as a retina or iris scan, fingerprint, voiceprint, or scan of hand or face geometry, any of which is collected, retained, converted, stored or shared to identify an individual; or\n      (ii) a user name or e-mail address in combination with a password or security question and answer that would permit access to an online account.\n      \"Private information\" does not include publicly available information that is lawfully made available to the general public from federal, state, or local government records.\n      [b.] c. The term \"breach of security\" shall mean the unauthorized access, acquisition, disclosure or use [by an employee or agent of an agency, or the unauthorized possession by someone other than an employee or agent of an agency, of personal identifying information] of computerized data that compromises the security, confidentiality or integrity of [such] private information maintained by an agency. Good faith or inadvertent [possession of] access, acquisition, disclosure, or use of any [personal identifying] private information by an employee or agent of an agency for the legitimate purposes of the agency, and good faith or legally mandated disclosure of any [personal identifying] private information by an employee or agent of an agency for the legitimate purposes of the agency shall not constitute a breach of security, but in such instances an agency must comply with the protocols issued pursuant to subdivision i of section 10-502.  \n      d. The term \"consumer reporting agency\" shall mean any person that, for monetary fees, dues, or on a cooperative nonprofit basis, regularly engages in whole or in part in the practice of assembling or evaluating consumer credit information or other information on consumers for the purpose of furnishing consumer reports to third parties, and uses any means or facility of interstate commerce for the purpose of preparing or furnishing consumer reports.\n      � 2. Section 10-502 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 45 for the year 2005, is amended to read as follows: \n      � 10-502. Agency disclosure of a [security breach] breach of security. a. Any city agency that owns [or], leases, or licenses data that includes [personal identifying information and any city agency that maintains but does not own data that includes personal identifying] private information[,] shall [immediately] promptly disclose to the [police department] chief privacy officer, office of cyber command and department of information technology and telecommunications any breach of security following discovery by a supervisor or manager, or following notification to a supervisor or manager, of such breach if such [personal identifying] private information was, or is reasonably believed to have been, accessed, acquired, disclosed, or used by an unauthorized person. \n      b. Subsequent to compliance with the provisions set forth in subdivision a of this section, any city agency that owns [or], leases, or licenses data that includes [personal identifying] private information shall disclose, in accordance with the procedures set forth in [subdivision] subdivisions d, e and f of this section, any breach of security following discovery by a supervisor or manager, or following notification to a supervisor or manager, of such breach to any [person] individual whose [personal identifying] private information was, or is reasonably believed to have been, accessed, acquired, disclosed, or used by an unauthorized person.\n      c.
