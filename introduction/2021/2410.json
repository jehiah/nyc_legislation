  "Summary": "This bill would amend the City’s data breach notification laws to align them with requirements in New York’s SHIELD Act. It would make certain definitions in City law more consistent with State law. City agencies that have suffered a security breach involving persons’ private identifying information would be required to promptly disclose it to the City’s Chief Privacy Officer, the Office of Cyber Command, and the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications; formerly the NYPD received this type of disclosure. The obligation to make this type of disclosure – including to affected persons – would be expanded to situations in which the information was reasonably believed to have been accessed, disclosed or used by an unauthorized person. With some exceptions, the bill would mandate that if 5,000 or more New York residents must be notified at one time pursuant to Section 10-502 of the City’s Administrative Code, the notifying agency must also notify consumer reporting agencies as to the timing, content and distribution of the notices, and approximate number of affected individuals. Certain agencies would have to coordinate and keep records on data breaches. The bill would mandate that Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and Taxi and Limousine Commission licensees required to make a data breach notification pursuant to State law, promptly submit a copy of the notification to their licensing agencies.",

Subsequent to compliance with the provisions set forth in subdivision a of this section, any city agency that owns [or], leases, or licenses data that includes [personal identifying] private information shall disclose, in accordance with the procedures set forth in [subdivision] subdivisions d, e and f of this section, any breach of security following discovery by a supervisor or manager, or following notification to a supervisor or manager, of such breach to any [person] individual whose [personal identifying] private information was, or is reasonably believed to have been, accessed, acquired, disclosed, or used by an unauthorized person.\n      c.

Should disclosure pursuant to paragraph one, two or three of subdivision d be impracticable or inappropriate given the circumstances of the breach and the identity of the victim, such disclosure shall be made by a mechanism [of the agency's election, provided such mechanism] that is reasonably targeted to the individual in a manner that does not further compromise the integrity of the [personal] private information.  \n      f. In the event that five thousand or more New York residents are to be notified at one time pursuant to this section, the agency shall also notify consumer reporting agencies as to the timing, content and distribution of the notices and approximate number of affected individuals.

Such a determination must be documented in writing and maintained for at least five years.\n      h.

Such protocols may apply to all agencies or a subset thereof.  \n      j. Notifications made pursuant to this section may overlap with notifications required pursuant to chapter 12 of title 23, including the regulations, policies and protocols issued by the chief privacy officer pursuant to such chapter. Nothing in this section or such chapter shall require duplicate notifications, as long as any notice provided meets any applicable requirements of both this law and such chapter.\n      � 3.
