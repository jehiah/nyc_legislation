  "Summary": "This bill would assign jurisdiction to city agencies for the cleaning and maintenance of certain city properties, including but not limited to, center malls, traffic islands, triangles, medians, underpasses, overpasses, safety zones, steep streets, pedestrian walkways, sidewalks along city-owned properties, dead-end streets and areas along arterial highways, railroad or subway lines. Under this proposal, the Department of Sanitation, the Department of Transportation and the Department of Parks and Recreation would each be required to develop and maintain a web-based application for the purpose of tracking its progress in relation to the cleaning and maintenance of the city properties under the agency’s jurisdiction.",
