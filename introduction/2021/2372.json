Except as otherwise provided by law, any person claiming to be injured by [an individual] a party who commits, directs, enables, participates in, or conspires in the commission of a crime of violence motivated by gender has a cause of action against such [individual] party in any court of competent jurisdiction for any or all of the following relief:\n      a. Compensatory and punitive damages;\n      b. Injunctive and declaratory relief;\n      c. Attorney's fees and costs; and\n      d. Such other relief as a court may deem appropriate.\n      � 2.

A civil action under this chapter shall be commenced within seven years after the alleged crime of violence motivated by gender occurred.

Notwithstanding any provision of law that imposes a period of limitation to the contrary, any civil claim or cause of action brought under this chapter that is barred because the applicable period of limitation has expired is hereby revived and may be commenced not earlier than six months after, and not later than two years and six months after, September 1, 2022. \n      � 2.
