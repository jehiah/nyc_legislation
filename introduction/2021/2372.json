Paragraph a of section 8-905 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 73 for the year 2000, is amended to read as follows:\n      2. A civil action under this chapter must be commenced within seven years after the alleged crime of violence motivated by gender as defined in section 8-903 of this chapter occurred. If, however, due to injury or disability resulting from an act or acts giving rise to a cause of action under this chapter, or due to infancy as defined in the civil procedure law and rules, a person entitled to commence an action under this chapter is unable to do so at the time such cause of action accrues, then the time within which the action must be commenced shall be extended to [seven] nine years after the inability to commence the action ceases. Notwithstanding any provision of law which imposes a period of limitation to the contrary, any civil claim or cause of action brought under this chapter which is barred because the applicable period of limitation has expired or the plaintiff previously failed to file a notice of claim or a notice of intention to file a claim or action thereon may be commenced not earlier than six months after, and not later than two years and six months after, January 1, 2022. \n      ï¿½ 2.
