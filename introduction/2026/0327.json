Security [guards in] reimbursements for nonpublic schools.\n      a. Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following terms shall have the following meanings:\n      \"Administering agency\" means one or more agencies designated by the mayor to administer the program or components thereof established by this section. The department of education, with its concurrence, may be designated as an administering agency.

For the purposes of subdivision n of this section, \"allowable costs\" shall include reasonable cost, as established by rules promulgated by the administering agency, paid by qualifying nonpublic schools for the purchase, installation, operation and maintenance of video surveillance cameras, and any related equipment necessary for the operation and monitoring of such cameras.\n      \"City\" means the city of New York.\n      \"Prevailing wage and supplements\" means the rate of wage and supplemental benefits per hour paid in the city to unarmed security guards as determined by the comptroller in accordance with section 234 of the labor law.\n      \"Qualifying nonpublic school\" means any nonprofit elementary or secondary school in the city that (a) is other than (i) a school of the city school district of the city of New York, or (ii) a school that shares space with a school of the city school district of the city of New York, (b) is providing instruction in accordance with the education law, (c) has been assigned a Basic Educational Data System (BEDS) code by the New York state department of education, or a similar successor identifier, (d) is serving students in any combination of grades pre-kindergarten through twelve.

The mayor shall designate an administering agency to administer the program.\n      d. The administering agency shall establish a qualified provider list. Such list may be developed based upon standards to be promulgated by rule, or may be developed through a procurement to be conducted by such agency.\n      e. Upon request of a qualifying nonpublic school, the administering agency shall reimburse such qualifying nonpublic school for the allowable costs of a security guard to provide security services at such school at all times that such school is open for school-related instruction or school-related events, including, but not limited to, school-related after school programs and athletic events.\n      f.

Further, the term \"student\" shall be deemed to refer to the full-time equivalent thereof, based upon a six hour and twenty-minute school day for a student.\n      g. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivisions e and f, a qualifying nonpublic school shall not be eligible to receive reimbursement from the administering agency unless:\n      1. such request is made in a form and manner prescribed by the administering agency;\n      2. each such security guard is employed by a security guard company on the qualified provider list, provided that if such list has not been established by the administering agency or the list contains fewer than three security guard companies, then each such security guard must be employed by a security guard company;\n      3. each such security guard is paid no less than the prevailing wage and supplements;\n      4. each such security guard provides security services and no other services;\n      5. each such security guard and security guard company has been employed or retained in compliance with applicable labor and employment laws;\n      6. the nonpublic school, acting in coordination with the security guard or security guard company, reports criminal and other significant public safety-related incidents to the police department or other appropriate government agency promptly after such incidents occur and in annual summary reports, in accordance with rules promulgated by the administering agency; and\n      7. the nonpublic school complies with rules promulgated by the administering agency.\n      h. The administering agency shall provide reimbursement of allowable costs on a quarterly basis after receiving satisfactory proof from the qualified nonpublic school of compliance with the requirements for reimbursement set forth in this section.\n      i.

To the extent the administering agency anticipates that the amount requested for reimbursement will exceed the funds available, the administering agency shall reimburse for allowable costs on an equitable basis until such funds are exhausted.\n      k. Nothing in this section shall prohibit a qualifying nonpublic school from paying a wage to a security guard greater than that for which it receives reimbursement pursuant to this section.\n      l. The provision of reimbursement to a qualifying nonpublic school for allowable costs of a security guard pursuant to this section shall not make the city of New York or any administering agency the employer of such security guard, and such school shall be solely responsible for withholding and payment of any taxes and other government required payments. Further, nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve any qualifying nonpublic school of responsibility for all other elements of security that may be required or appropriate and are not funded pursuant to this section.\n      m. The administering agency may promulgate any rules as may be necessary for the purposes of carrying out the provisions of this section, including, but not limited to, rules (i) relating to the training of security guards, (ii) ensuring that security guards and security guard companies are appropriately qualified to provide security services to qualifying nonpublic schools, (iii) providing for prompt reporting of criminal and other significant public safety-related incidents to the police department or other appropriate government agency as well as annual summary reports of such incidents, (iv) ensuring the efficient operation of the program; and (v) requiring that a school requesting reimbursement pursuant to this section certify that such school does not use funding from the city pursuant to subparagraph (5) of paragraph (e) of subdivision (3) of section 2853 of the education law for the provision of security services during the same school year as receiving reimbursements pursuant to this section.\n      [n. Any qualifying non-public school that operates in more than one address shall be eligible for reimbursement for the allowable costs of a security guard to provide security services at each such address, provided that the eligibility requirements set forth in subdivision f are satisfied at each such address.]\n      n.

Such program shall consider the enrollment size and financial endowment of qualifying nonpublic schools, in determining reimbursement levels and potential cost-sharing obligations of qualifying nonpublic schools that have financial means to otherwise fund the installation and operation of video surveillance cameras. \n      o. Any qualifying non-public school that operates in more than one address shall be eligible for reimbursement for the allowable costs of security guards and video surveillance cameras at each such address, provided that the eligibility requirements set forth in this section are satisfied at each such address.\n      � 2.
