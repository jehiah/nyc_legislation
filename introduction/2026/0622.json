  "Summary": "This bill would require the New York City (“NYC”) Department of Transportation to create a no-fee provisional, or temporary, special vehicle identification parking permit for applicants to use upon the filing of an application for a special vehicle identification permit. The bill would also require the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to allow certain licensed medical professionals to certify an application for a special vehicle identification parking permit. The bill requires DOT to establish an electronic portal for special vehicle identification parking permit applications which accepts electronic signatures, document uploads, and provides status notifications during the permit application process.",
