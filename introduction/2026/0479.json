  "Summary": "This bill would require that, prior to the issuance of a renewal of a license, the department of transportation approve in writing a stoop line stand’s location, based on a determination that it will not obstruct pedestrians’ free use of the sidewalk, after taking into consideration the area’s pedestrian volume and, where applicable, findings from a required site visit. If a stoop line stand license is within 10 feet of a permanent structure that narrows the sidewalk for at least 10 feet, the department of transportation would be required to conduct a site visit prior to approving the stoop line stand license location.",
