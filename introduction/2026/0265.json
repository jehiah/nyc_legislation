Where CCHR finds that such a discriminatory practice results from a willful, wanton or malicious act, in a multiple dwelling with 1 to 100 units the civil penalty would be $10,000 to $250,000, in a multiple dwelling with 101 to 500 units, the civil penalty would be $100,000 to $250,000, and in a multiple dwelling with more than 500 units the civil penalty would be $150,000 to $250,000.",
