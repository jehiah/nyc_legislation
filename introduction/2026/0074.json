  "Summary": "This bill would amend the Nuisance Abatement Law to clarify that the distribution for sale, selling at wholesale or retail, or delivering to consumers of any cannabis, cannabis product, medical cannabis, or cannabinoid hemp or hemp extract product without the appropriate registration, license, or permit issued by New York State is a public nuisance subject to permanent and preliminary injunctions. It would also create a new category of public nuisance involving the selling, delivery, or giving away of cannabis to any person under 21 years of age. This bill would also make the abovementioned public nuisances subject to temporary closing orders and temporary restraining orders.",
