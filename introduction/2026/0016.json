  "Summary": "This bill would direct the Department of Buildings (DOB), with assistance from the Department of Environmental Protection, the Fire Department, and any other relevant agency, to conduct a year-long study to determine the feasibility of implementing solar-ready measures for commercial buildings. The DOB would then be required to submit a report to the Speaker of the Council and the Mayor with the results of this study.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. As used in this local law, the following terms have the following meanings: \n      Commercial building. The term \"commercial building\" has the same meaning as set forth in sections C202 and R202 of the 2020 New York city energy conservation code.\n      Solar power. The term \"solar power\" means the use of the sun's energy either directly, as thermal energy, or through the use of photovoltaic cells in solar panels and transparent photovoltaic glass, to generate electricity.\n      Solar-ready measures. The term \"solar-ready measures\" means any measures incorporated into building design and construction that are designed to permit the building to install photovoltaic cells in solar panels and transparent photovoltaic glass, or to incorporate other means of utilizing solar power, even if the installation does not occur at the time of construction.\n      Use and occupancy classification. The term \"use and occupancy classification\" means any use and occupancy classifications set forth in chapter 3 of the New York city building code. \n      � 2. Feasibility study on the implementation of solar-ready measures for commercial buildings. The commissioner of buildings, in consultation with the commissioner of environmental protection, the fire commissioner, and the commissioners of any other relevant agency, shall conduct a feasibility study on the implementation of solar-ready measures for commercial buildings.  Such feasibility study shall: \n      1. Evaluate the utility of implementing solar-ready measures in commercial buildings; \n2. Identify any barriers to implementing solar-ready measures in commercial buildings; \n3. Identify any type of commercial building by use and occupancy classification that could incorporate solar-ready measures; and\n4. Assess the estimated costs of requiring solar-ready measures in commercial buildings\nthat can incorporate such measures. \n      � 3. Within 12 months after this local law takes effect, the commissioner of buildings shall submit to the mayor and the speaker of the council a report with the results of the feasibility study.\n      � 4.
