The bill would further require that the report be submitted to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council and posted online. The report would have to include, in part, the causes of delays and high costs in the capital projects compared to other large cities; recommendations for New York State and local legislative, policy, and regulatory changes to reduce these delays and costs; and recommendations for improving local monitoring and data collection practices relating to the capital projects. The study and report would not cover capital projects involving acquisition of real property.",
