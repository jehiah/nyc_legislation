  "Summary": "This bill would amend an exception in the definition of “covered building” for purposes of the energy and emissions limits enacted in Local Law 97 of 2019. The bill would also amend an exception in the identical definition for purposes of the energy conservation measure requirements, also enacted in Local Law 97 of 2019. The amended exception would exclude dwelling units that meet certain specifications from these definitions of “covered building.”",
