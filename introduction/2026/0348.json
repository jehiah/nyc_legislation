  "Summary": "This bill would require the Police Department (NYPD) to create a procedure under which NYPD officers can change the locks on the dwellings of people who have been illegally locked out of those dwellings to allow those who have been illegally locked out to return to their dwellings. The NYPD would be required to add such a procedure to its Patrol Guide. When NYPD officers change locks pursuant to such procedure, they would be required to provide new keys that open the new lock to all the dwelling occupants and to the landlord.",
