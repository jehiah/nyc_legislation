  "Summary": "This bill would require the department of citywide administrative services (DCAS) to conduct a feasibility study to assess whether the department could offer a program to reimburse civil service applicants who did not receive an employment offer before the eligible list upon which their name was listed expires for the required fees associated with the application process. The study would assume that each reimbursement is capped at $500, and that civil service applicants would be required to submit a reimbursement form within 6 months of the eligible list they appeared on expiring.",
