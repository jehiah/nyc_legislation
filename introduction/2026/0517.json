  "Summary": "This bill would require any city agency that holds biological evidence (“custodial agency”), including the New York City Police Department and the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, to preserve biological evidence related to criminal and juvenile delinquency investigations and cases. Custodial agencies would be required to preserve biological evidence for 100 years after collection, unless all individuals in custody or supervision as a result of the final adjudication of a case related to the biological evidence have been released or if all interested parties have been notified and do not object to destruction of the biological evidence. Custodial agencies would be required to preserve biological evidence in a manner and amount sufficient to create a DNA profile.",

The term \"profile\" means the results of DNA analysis of biological material that can be used as a unique identifier of an individual.\n      b. Preservation. 1. A custodial agency shall preserve biological evidence until:\n      (a) All individuals in custody or supervision as a result of the final adjudication of a covered case related to the biological evidence are released from custody or supervision; or\n      (b) 100 years have passed since the biological evidence was first collected.\n      2. When the custodial agency cannot preserve biological evidence because its size, bulk, or physical character renders preservation impracticable, the custodial agency shall remove and preserve portions of the biological evidence in a quantity sufficient to permit future DNA testing before returning or disposing of the remainder of such biological evidence.\n      c. Destruction. The custodial agency may destroy biological evidence prior to the end of the time period specified in subparagraph (a) of paragraph 1 of subdivision b of this section if the following conditions are met:\n      1. No provision of federal or state law requires such biological evidence be preserved;\n      2. The custodial agency has notified the following parties in writing of the intent to destroy such biological evidence:\n      (a) All persons in custody or supervision as a result of the final adjudication of a covered case related to such biological evidence;\n      (b) The attorney of record for each person in custody or supervision as a result of a covered case related to such biological evidence; \n      (c) The district attorney, the special narcotics prosecutor, or the corporation counsel that brought the related covered case; and\n      (d) The office of the attorney general of New York; and\n      3. After 180 days of giving notice pursuant to paragraph 2, none of the parties in paragraph 2 have filed a motion for testing of such biological evidence or submitted a written request for retention of such biological evidence to the custodial agency.\n      d. Inventory. Within 30 days after receipt of a written request by a person in custody or supervision as a result of the final adjudication of a covered case, the custodial agency shall prepare an inventory of biological evidence that has been preserved in connection with such person's case and provide such inventory to such person and their attorney of record.\n      e. Lost biological evidence. If biological evidence that was required to be preserved under subdivision b of this section cannot be located, the head of the custodial agency shall provide an affidavit, under penalty of perjury, that describes the efforts taken to locate such biological evidence and that such biological evidence could not be located.\n      f. Remedies. If a court finds that biological evidence was destroyed in violation of this section, it may impose appropriate sanctions and order appropriate remedies.\n      g. Accreditation. This section or the administration thereof may not be construed in a manner inconsistent with federal and state requirements and procedures regarding accreditation of forensic laboratories and best practices for forensic laboratories.\n      � 2. Chapter 2 of title 17 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 17-209 to read as follows:\n      � 17-209 Biological evidence retention.
