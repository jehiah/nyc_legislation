  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation (DOT) to conduct a study on the feasibility of installing raised crosswalks, intersections, and speed reducers at intersections and roadways adjacent to City schools. This bill would also require DOT to issue a report on the findings of the feasibility study to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council. This bill will repeal and replace Administrative Code § 19-189 in order to provide essential information to the Speaker of the Council and the Mayor regarding the installation of raised crosswalks, raised intersections, and speed reducers. Finally, this bill would grant the Commissioner of Transportation the authority to install or decline to install raised crosswalks, raised intersections, or speed reducers where practicable following the feasibility study.",
