  "Summary": "This bill would prohibit public employees who have substantial policy discretion, other than elected officials, from determining policy regarding their former private sector employer for two years after leaving that employer. It would also prohibit public servants who were previously lobbyists from making policy related to any of their former clients. Public servants would be permitted to determine policy if they receive written approval from the head of their agency and the Conflicts of Interest Board (COIB). The bill would require COIB to issue a public, written determination. Public servants could also determine policies for firms in which their spouse, domestic partner, child, parent, or sibling has an interest. All public servants, other than elected officials, would be required to disclose their previous employers to COIB.",
