  "Summary": "This bill would implement term limits for board members and would reduce the amount of board members from 28 to 20, 10 of whom would be appointed by the Mayor, 10 of whom would be appointed by the Speaker of the City Council. Additionally, the board would be tasked with providing policy recommendations to the Department of Youth and Community Development (DYCD). DYCD would then be required to submit a report to the Mayor and the Speaker of the City Council describing the activities of the board, the recommendations received from the board, and the department’s responses to such recommendations. DYCD would also be required to publicly post information about the youth board’s members, their term lengths, and other information that the commissioner deems relevant.",
