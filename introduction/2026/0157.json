  "Summary": "This bill would require the Fire Department (FDNY) and New York City Emergency Management to jointly develop and implement a notification system that would notify the Departments of Buildings (DOB), Housing Preservation and Development (HPD), Environmental Protection (DEP), and Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), whenever FDNY responds to a structural fire. FDNY would also be required to conduct inspections of an affected unit or building within 48 hours of the occurrence of any structural fire.  This bill would also require FDNY to develop guidelines in coordination with DOB, HPD, DEP, and DOHMH to determine when these agencies, or other agencies, would be required to respond and provide additional services, including additional inspections, after a structural fire.",
