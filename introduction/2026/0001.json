  "Summary": "This bill would require the Police Commissioner to develop and implement a plan to address and contain the risk of injury, intimidation, and interference at places of religious worship in New York City while preserving and protecting protest rights. The plan would address these issues through the use of buffer zones at the entrances to and exits from places of religious worship. The Commissioner would be required to submit a proposed plan, no later than 45 days after the bill’s effective date, to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council. No later than 90 days after the effective date, the Commissioner would be required to send a final plan to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council and post the final plan on the New York Police Department website. Lastly, the Commissioner would be required to implement the final plan no later than 120 days after the effective date.",
