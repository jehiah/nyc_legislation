  "Summary": "This bill would mandate a report on the feasibility of creating a universal benefits application for local public benefit programs and mandate the creation of a universal benefits application as determined feasible by the Commissioner of the Department of Social Services. This bill would also codify Access NYC, which is a screening tool for public assistance programs, direct the incorporation of new and existing programs as deemed possible, and require increased public awareness efforts of such tools. This bill would also repeal section 3-119.3 of the administrative code of the city of New York, relating to a study on notification of public assistance eligibility.",
