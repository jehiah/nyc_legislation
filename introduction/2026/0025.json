  "Summary": "This bill would require the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) or another agency designated by the Mayor with the appropriate subject matter expertise to establish a 3-year pilot program that provides sleep apnea treatment at no cost to individuals. The bill would require DOHMH to provide oral appliances that have been cleared by the United States Food and Drug Administration to treat sleep apnea. The bill would also require DOHMH to publish a report on the pilot program’s effectiveness and whether it should be made permanent.",
