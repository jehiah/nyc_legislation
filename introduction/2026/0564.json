  "Summary": "This bill would set a target, measured in greened acres, of stormwater managed by green infrastructure in the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) area. This bill would require the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to install, or cause to be installed, green infrastructure projects to meet such target. The bill would also require DEP to publish an annual greened acre report until such target is met. Finally, the bill would require DEP to measure all of the city’s green infrastructure projects in greened acres, and publish those greened acre measurements for each green infrastructure project on the green infrastructure program map.",
