  "Summary": "This bill would require retail food stores to provide a discount to customers if the price at the cash register of certain items, including food, paper products, cleaning products, and health products, exceeds the ticketed, shelf, sale, or advertised price of the item. Stores would be required to post notice of this discount policy. Customers and store personnel could file complaints regarding violations of this discount policy to the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection.",

No retail store shall charge a retail price for any stock keeping item, whether or not exempt under subdivision c of this section, which exceeds the lower of any item, shelf, sale or advertised price of such stock keeping item.\n      2. If there is a discrepancy between the retail price and the item price, shelf price, sale price, or advertised price on any stock keeping item, and the retail price is not the lowest price or does not reflect any qualifying discount from valid coupons, quantity purchases, or loyalty programs, a retail food store: \n      (a) Shall not charge the consumer for 1 unit of the stock keeping item, if the lowest price is $10 or less; \n      (b) Shall charge the consumer the lowest price less $10 for 1 unit of the stock keeping item, if the lowest price is more than $10; and \n      (c) Shall charge the consumer the lowest price for any additional units of the stock keeping item.\n      3. Paragraph 2 of this subdivision shall not apply where:\n      (a) There is evidence of willful tampering, such as the removing, altering or moving of price tags, stamps, marks, or signs;\n      (b) The discrepancy is a gross error, in that the lowest price is less than half of the retail price, and the consumer cannot show that in the previous 30 days, the retail store sold or advertised the stock keeping item at the lowest price; or\n      (c) A consumer seeks additional price reductions required pursuant to subparagraphs a and b of paragraph 2 of this subdivision at any retail food store after an initial purchase of the same item within 24 hours. \n      4.
