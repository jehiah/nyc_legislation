  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Education to provide annual workforce stabilization payments to eligible school paraprofessionals on August 1 of each year. Each payment would be a non-pensionable, lump sum payment of $10,000, pro-rated by the number of school days on payroll in the relevant school year. The requirement would be repealed upon the execution of a collective bargaining agreement that provides for an increase in the total annual compensation for school paraprofessionals equal to or greater than the amount of the workforce stabilization payments.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Legislative intent and findings. The council finds and declares that (i) the city of New York has experienced persistent difficulties in recruiting and retaining school paraprofessionals, resulting in staffing shortages and turnover that impair the continuity of educational and student-support services, including critical services for students with disabilities; (ii) maintaining a stable school paraprofessional workforce is necessary to protect student safety and to ensure the effective delivery of instructional and support services in schools; (iii) temporary workforce stabilization payments are necessary to address these emergency conditions until these conditions are rectified through collective bargaining; and (iv) this local law is intended to provide such payments in a manner that does not limit or diminish the rights of any party to collectively bargain pursuant to article 14 of the civil service law or chapter 3 of title 12 of the administrative code of the city of New York.\n      � 2. Workforce stabilization payments for school paraprofessionals. a. Definitions. For purposes of this local law, the following terms have the following meanings:\n      Department.
