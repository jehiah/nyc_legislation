  "TextID": 81129,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Section 28-101.5 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new definition of \"MAJOR SOLAR ENERGY PROJECT\" in alphabetical order to read as follows:\nMAJOR SOLAR ENERGY PROJECT. The installation of a solar photovoltaic energy system that is designed to operate with an installed power generating capacity of 25 kilowatts direct current or greater, as measured by nameplate capacity, or the alteration of a solar photovoltaic energy system where added equipment brings the total power generating capacity of the system to 25 kilowatts direct current or greater.\n\n      � 2. Section 28-116.2.4.2 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 77 for the year 2023, is amended to read as follows:\n� 28-116.2.4.2 Final inspection prior to letter of completion. In all cases where the permitted work does not require the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, the final inspection shall be performed by an approved agency on behalf of the owner or by the department as directed by the commissioner. The applicant shall take all reasonable and necessary steps to ensure that the final inspection is performed within one year after the expiration of the last permit. The inspection shall be performed after all work authorized by the building permit is completed.

The approved agency shall report uncorrected discrepancies and defective work to the registered design professional of record and the owner in writing. The approved agency shall report all conditions noted or observed as hazardous to life, safety or health that are not immediately corrected to the immediate attention of the commissioner. All defects noted in such inspection shall be corrected. The final inspection report shall confirm that defects noted have been corrected, that the work is in substantial compliance with the approved construction documents and with this code and other applicable laws and rules and that all required inspections were performed. Final inspection reports shall be filed with and maintained by the department. Records of final inspections made by approved agencies shall be maintained by such persons for a period of six years after sign-off or for such other period as the commissioner shall require and shall be made available to the department upon request.\n      Exceptions:\n      \n1. \tFinal inspection shall be performed by the department for permitted work in R-2 occupancies if the building is listed on the department of housing preservation and development's website pursuant to paragraph 6 of subdivision m of section 27-2115 of the administrative code. The department shall charge a fee for such inspection.\n2. \tFinal inspection shall be performed by the department for major solar energy projects.\n3. \tFinal inspection shall not be required for temporary construction equipment permits.
