  "Summary": "This bill would require the Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to promulgate an indirect source rule to reduce emissions attributable to the use of indirect sources, such as warehouses or other structures that attract mobile sources of air pollution, such as vehicles. The indirect source rule would regulate certain large warehouses and any other indirect sources determined by the Commissioner.",
