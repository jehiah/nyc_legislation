  "Summary": "This bill adds protections for tipped workers against tip-based wage theft by their employers. Pursuant to this bill, employers would be required to disclose the daily amount of total compensation, amount of wages, amount of gratuities, aggregate amount of gratuities earned through cashless payments, and total amount of gratuities in the tip pool if the worker is part of a tip pool. The bill also creates additional administrative remedies and a private right of action. This bill also requires fast food and food service establishments to allow customers the option to confer a gratuity in same the manner that they paid for their food. Finally, this bill adds new terms and definitions to the Administrative Code’s Fair Work Practices subchapter.",
