  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Housing Preservation and Development to create a centralized webpage on the housing portal, to allow housing portal assistance organizations the ability to view and access the accounts of any user that designates such organization to act on behalf of the user. Using the webpage, housing portal assistance organizations would be able to view available unit information, apply to units on behalf of users, track the progress of applications submitted by users or the organization, and receive notifications about new units that match a user’s criteria.",
