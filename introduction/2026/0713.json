  "Summary": "This bill would create a task force to study and develop recommendations regarding the obstacles faced by children of incarcerated parents, from arrest to reunification. The task force would have nine members, including the Department of Correction commissioner, who would serve as the chairperson, the commissioners of the Administration for Children’s Services, the New York City Police Department, and appointees of the Mayor and the Council Speaker who would have relevant expertise. Within one year of the formation of the task force, it would issue a report with recommendations on how to improve services for children of incarcerated parents. The task force would cease to exist after the issuance of the report.",
