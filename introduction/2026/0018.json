The department of sanitation shall consult with the department of environmental protection prior to choosing the locations for the pilot program. The department of sanitation shall provide to the mayor and speaker of the council a report on such pilot program upon its conclusion. Such report shall include an evaluation of whether and where the power washing pilot program is suitable for expansion, guidelines for how many miles of sidewalk within commercial corridors should be power washed per year, and an evaluation of the impact that pedestrian volume and susceptibility to heat island effects has on feasibility and desirability of using power washing machines to clean sidewalk surfaces in such locations. \n      � 2.
