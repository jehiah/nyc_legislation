  "Summary": "This bill would require the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene, in consultation with the Chancellor of the City School District, to provide each public middle and high school with an adequate supply of vape detectors. The Chancellor would be required to install, at the Chancellor’s discretion, vape detectors in each public middle and high school and would have the discretion to determine the appropriate number, type, and locations of detectors for each school. Additionally, no later than two years after this proposed law takes effect, the Chancellor would be required to submit to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council and post online a report detailing the progress of vape detector installation in public middle and high schools. This report would need to include the name and borough of each school, whether vape detectors have been installed, the number and locations of any detectors installed, and explanations for any lack of detector installation.",
