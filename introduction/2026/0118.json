  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), in consultation with the Department of Design and Construction and any other relevant agency, to implement a two-year pilot project to install green climate screens in five neighborhoods that are, or include, both flood-prone neighborhoods and disadvantaged communities. The bill would also require DEP to collect data on the stormwater capture and noise mitigation of such green climate screens, and report on such data, including any plans to expand the pilot program.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. a. Definitions. As used in this local law, the following terms have the following meanings:\n      Department. The term \"department\" means the department of environmental protection. \n      Disadvantaged communities. The term \"disadvantaged communities\" has the same meaning as set forth in section 75-0101 of the environmental conservation law.\n      Flood-prone neighborhood. The term \"flood-prone neighborhood\" means a neighborhood tabulation area that the department identifies as prone to stormwater or groundwater flooding based on the frequency and severity of historic and projected stormwater or groundwater flooding incidents within such areas.\n      Green climate screen. The term \"green climate screen\" means a vertical and freestanding vegetation-covered structure lined with mineral wool, or another highly-absorbent material, that receives stormwater runoff from an adjacent building through a gravity-driven conveyance system, designed for evapotranspiration of stormwater and noise mitigation.\n      Neighborhood tabulation area. The term \"neighborhood tabulation area\" means a geographical area defined by the department of city planning for the purposes of providing neighborhood-level data.\n      b. The department, in consultation with the department for design and construction and any other relevant agency, shall conduct a 2-year pilot project for the installation of green climate screens in at least 5 neighborhood tabulation areas that are, or include, both flood-prone neighborhoods and disadvantaged communities. As part of such pilot project, the department shall implement the best available research methodologies to monitor stormwater capture and noise mitigation. \n      c. No later than May 1, 2028, the department shall post on its website and submit to the mayor and the speaker of the council a report on the results of the pilot. Such report shall include:\n      1. Data collected by the department related to the effects of green climate screens on stormwater capture and noise mitigation; \n      2. An assessment of the range of options for green climate screens and the technical feasibility, environmental impacts, and all anticipated costs of such options; and \n      3. Any plans for expansion of the project, including possible site locations for additional green climate screen installations, and opportunities for community input and co-planning.\n\t� 2.
