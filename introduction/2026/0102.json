The Campaign Finance Board would be required to develop notices to disseminate through print and electronic media that notify campaign-related fundraisers and political consultants of this lobbying prohibition. Any person that knowingly and willing violates the prohibition would be subject to civil penalties, and second and subsequent violations would constitute a class A misdemeanor.",
