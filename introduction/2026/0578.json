  "Summary": "This bill would reform the Industrial Business Zone (IBZ) Boundary Commission by expanding its membership and increasing transparency and accountability. The commission would add three new members: two appointed by the Speaker and one by the Public Advocate. The bill would require a two-thirds supermajority vote for any amendments or repeals of existing IBZ boundaries. The commission would be required to notify the City Council of any approved boundary changes within five business days. Commission members would be prohibited from having financial interests in real estate development entities or land use consulting firms, and registered lobbyists would be barred from serving on the commission.",
