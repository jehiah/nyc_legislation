This bill would require that DPR: (i) reduce the backlog of low- and moderate-risk tree work orders; (ii) increase routine inspections of individual trees; (iii) implement a reporting requirement for DPR’s work on previously-completed inspections of low- and moderate-risk trees; and (iv) set standards for response times to all trees inspected in the future.",
