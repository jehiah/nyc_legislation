  "Summary": "This bill would require Department of Parks and Recreation (Parks) to place surveillance cameras in at least 10 city parks where there are frequent complaints of illegal all-terrain vehicle or dirtbike usage or where the commissioner otherwise has reason to believe that damage to park property may occur as a result of such usage. Within a year of the law’s enactment, Parks must report to the mayor and the Council on the effectiveness of the program, whether more resources are needed to deter illegal vehicle use in parks, and whether a permanent program would benefit from greater coordination with other city departments.",

No later than 1 year after the effective date of this local law, the commissioner shall post on the department's website and submit to the mayor and speaker of the council a report that details the resources the department uses to deter illegal use of motor vehicles and the additional resources the department would need to implement a permanent illegal motor vehicle use enforcement program. The report shall include, at minimum:\n      1. The number of employees the department has dedicated for the pilot program established under this local law and the number of employees the department would need to implement a permanent illegal motor vehicle use enforcement program, if such numbers are different, and the proportion of such employees' time dedicated to such program;\n      2. The type of equipment the department has and additional equipment the department would need to implement a permanent illegal motor vehicle use enforcement program;\n      3.

All locations where surveillance cameras maintained by the department are installed in or near parks as of the date of the report; and\n      5. A description of the department's coordination with the police department, the department of transportation, and other agencies or offices that would be necessary to install surveillance cameras on utility poles or locations not within the department's jurisdiction.\n      � 4.
