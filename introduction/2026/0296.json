  "Summary": "This bill would require the Mayor’s Office to End Gender-Based Violence (ENDGBV), in consultation with the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), to compile and review all existing data related to gender-based violence (GBV), including domestic violence, and then develop a report with recommendations for agencies to improve the collection and integration of data on GBV. The bill would also require ENDGBV, in consultation with DOHMH, to develop an outreach program to survey GBV screening practices by healthcare providers and provide information to integrate trauma-informed practice to the screenings, and then to report on the practices of the healthcare providers. In addition, the bill would require ENDGBV to develop a data dashboard to share data from city and state agencies around GBV. Finally, the bill would require the Department of Social Services and the Administration of Child Services to report on their practices around screenings for GBV and number of screenings for GBV conducted.",
