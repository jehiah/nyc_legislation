  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Citywide Administrative Services to study the feasibility of using renewable diesel to heat buildings, both publicly and privately owned. The study would: assess potential benefits of and barriers to using renewable diesel for heating; assess whether such use would affect compliance with the City’s electrification and climate change policies; and recommend new policies related to the use of renewable diesel for heating. The study would be due to the Mayor, to the Speaker, and on the Department’s website within 1 year after this bill becomes law.",

The term \"biodiesel\" means a fuel, designated B100, that is composed exclusively of mono-alkyl esters of long chain fatty acids derived from feedstock and that meets the specifications of ASTM standard D 6751-12.\n      Department. The term \"department\" means the department of citywide administrative services.\n      Feedstock. The term \"feedstock\" has the same meaning as set forth in section 24-104 of the administrative code of the city of New York.\n      Renewable diesel. The term \"renewable diesel\" means a fuel, designated R100, that is derived from feedstock and that meets the specifications of ASTM standard D975.\n      Renewable diesel blend. The term \"renewable diesel blend\" means a fuel that is a mixture of renewable diesel and petroleum diesel or biodiesel.\n      b. Study. The department, in coordination with the department of buildings, the department of environmental protection, and any other relevant agency, shall study the feasibility of using renewable diesel and renewable diesel blends as heating oil in city-owned and privately-owned buildings throughout the city. Such study shall include, but not be limited to:\n      1. An assessment of potential benefits of using renewable diesel and renewable diesel blends as heating oil, including but not limited to any advantages of renewable diesel over petroleum diesel or biodiesel;\n      2. An assessment of potential barriers to using renewable diesel and renewable diesel blends as heating oil, including but not limited to:\n      (a) Environmental concerns, including but not limited to pollution, energy consumption, and other environmental impacts of different feedstocks, refinement methods, and transportation methods;\n      (b) Technological concerns, including but not limited to compatibility with boilers and other heating infrastructure designed for petroleum diesel heating oil;\n      (c) Safety concerns, including but not limited to health effects on humans from exposure to chemicals or air pollutants during the refinement, transportation, or burning of renewable diesel; and\n      (d) Cost concerns;\n      3. An assessment of whether and how increased use of renewable diesel and renewable diesel blends as heating oil would affect compliance with section 11-104 of the energy law and any provisions of the New York city energy conservation code designed to achieve the objectives of such section; section 24-177.1 of the administrative code of the city of New York; article 320 of chapter 3 of title 28 of the administrative code of the city of New York; and any other relevant electrification or climate change requirements or targets set by federal, state, or local law, or by regulation or mayoral initiative; \n      4. Recommendations as to whether and when the city should allow the use of renewable diesel and renewable diesel blends for purposes of compliance with the clean heating oil mandate set forth in section 24-168.1 of the administrative code of the city of New York; and\n      5. Recommendations as to whether the city should implement other measures related to the use of renewable diesel and renewable diesel blends as heating oil in city-owned and privately-owned buildings.\n      c. Report. No later than 1 year after the effective date of this local law, the department shall submit to the mayor and the speaker of the council and post on the department's website a report on the findings of the study conducted pursuant to subdivision b of this local law.\n      � 2.
