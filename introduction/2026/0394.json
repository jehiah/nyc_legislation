  "Summary": "This bill is to amend the administrative code to require the director of management and budget to submit to the Mayor, the Speaker of the Council, and the chair of the relevant committee a report pursuant a list of enumerated items in the statute regarding the status of federal funding to the City, City agencies, and not-for-profit corporations. The bill requires the director to submit a report by the 25th day of each month containing the required information for each previous month. Currently, this office does not publish or submit any up-to-date reports regarding all federal funding streams awarded-to, and used by, the City. The report would provide council members, and their constituents, with a comprehensive picture of the role federal funding plays in the City, with the purpose of allowing them to prepare for any potential changes to federal funding streams.",
