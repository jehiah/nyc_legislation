  "Summary": "This bill would permit elected officials and candidates for elected office to notify, in writing, owners of generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems that they do not authorize those systems to produce manipulated audio, photos, or videos with their likeness. After a notification is provided, owners of generative AI systems would be required to implement methods that would prohibit uses from generating media of those elected officials or candidates. Any entity that violates this law is guilty of a misdemeanor and can be fined up to $2,500 per depiction. This would not apply where the media is processed by a third party over which an owner has no control. An elected official or candidate can also seek injunctive relief prohibiting use of their image.",

This section shall not apply to a covered entity where the visual or audio outputs of the system are processed by a third party that has no ownership or control over the underlying generative model.\n      f. Injunctive relief. An elected official or candidate for nomination for election who is, or is likely to become, injured by a violation of subdivision b of this section may seek injunctive relief prohibiting such conduct. This subdivision shall not be construed to limit or preclude any other cause of action available to any person injured or aggrieved by the violation of this section.\n      � 2.
