  "Summary": "This bill would repeal section 18-143 of the Administrative Code relating to accessibility reporting in parks, and replace it with a new section with stronger reporting requirements. Under the new section, the Department of Parks and Recreation (Parks) would be required to conduct an annual assessment of park entrances, bathrooms, playgrounds, beaches, and pools to determine if they are compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act. If these facilities are not compliant, Parks must report on what steps they are taking to bring these facilities into compliance and how long it will take to achieve compliance. Parks would also be required to create a map on their website that shows all Parks facilities included in the report.",
