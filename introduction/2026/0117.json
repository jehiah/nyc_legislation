  "Summary": "This bill would require the Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability (OLTPS), in consultation with the Department of Environmental Protection, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, and the New York City Economic Development Corporation, to conduct a recurring study, the first of which would be due on December 1 2027, with all others due every 5 years thereafter, assessing the environmental and health impacts of the John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) on communities in Southeast Queens. The bill would require OLTPS to consult with environmental justice organizations when conducting such study. Finally, the bill would require OLTPS and other relevant agencies to recommend and implement city programs to mitigate any adverse environmental and health effects found in such study, and recommend to the mayor any amendments to the city’s JFK lease agreement based on the study.",
