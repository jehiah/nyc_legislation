  "Summary": "This bill would amend the New York City Plumbing Code to require that, where plumbing fixtures are required under the Plumbing Code, at least one separate gender-neutral bathroom be provided. The existing requirement that where plumbing fixtures are required under the Plumbing Code separate bathrooms be provided by sex would be undisturbed. Provisions in the Plumbing Code and New York City Building Code that refer to fixtures required in bathrooms based on sex would be amended to account for the bill requiring a minimum number of gender-neutral bathrooms.",
