  "Summary": "This bill would preserve existing sanitation-based civil penalties and other punishment for fire hydrant obstruction violations involving the throwing or piling of snow or ice. This bill would also make clear that higher civil penalties, criminal fines, and other punishment are applicable for other fire hydrant obstruction violations and for violations of newsstand distance requirements from fire hydrants.",
