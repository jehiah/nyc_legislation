  "Summary": "This bill would require that the New York City Department of Correction (DOC) conduct a study on the efficacy of using lower-strength OC sprays in DOC facilities. The study would also require DOC to study the extent to which incarcerated persons, staff, or visitors to DOC facilities may have medical complications due to the use of higher-strength OC spray, and to consider whether it may be appropriate to use lower-strength spray in targeted situations where people in the facility may be at higher risk of medical complications from the use of higher-strength spray.",
