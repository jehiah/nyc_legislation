  "Summary": "This bill would prohibit the dissemination of videos, images, or sound recordings that have been intentionally manipulated to depict speech or conduct by a local candidate for office that did not actually occur, but which appears from the video, image, or sound recording to be genuine. The prohibition would only pertain to conduct intended to influence the results of a local election or injure the reputation of a candidate, and only apply within 60 days of a primary, special, or general election.",
