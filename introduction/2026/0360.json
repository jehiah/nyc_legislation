  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Finance (Department) to send owners of residential real property, with their statement of account, detailed information on the availability of certain exemptions from real property tax or payments in lieu of taxes (PILOT) to the Battery Park City Authority, for which that owner may be eligible. Such notices shall include information, at minimum, for the SCRIE, DRIE, Veterans’, and cooperative/condominium exemptions, along with any other exemption the Department includes at their discretion.\r\n\r\nThe bill would also require the Department to notify each owner of residential real property in the city about how they can register in the Automated City Register Information System (ACRIS) database, or successor database, such that they can receive notices when deeds, mortgages, or related documents affecting their ownership interest have been recorded against their property.\r\n\r\nThe bill would also permit a person eligible for such exemptions to designate an adult third party who may receive these notices on their behalf, with the consent of the third party.\r\n\r\nThe bill would also require the Department to send a reminder notice to such owners who have not submitted renewal applications for such eligible exemptions. The notice must include information on qualifications and filing deadlines, and be accessible in the ten designated citywide languages as well as Braille or via audio.",
