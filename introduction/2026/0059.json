  "Summary": "This bill would require that the sheriff and city marshals contact the Department of Social Services/Human Resources Administration (HRA) when they receive an order that would result in housing displacement. Where HRA receives notice from the sheriff or city marshals about an order that would lead to housing displacement, HRA would be required to respond by examining the person’s eligibility for legal counsel, provide the person with contact for legal counsel and connect the individual to such counsel. The information would be provided in plain language and in the appropriate language for the person.",
