  "Summary": "This bill requires the Mayor’s Office of Child Care and Early Childhood Education, in consultation with the Department of Education and community-based early childhood organizations, to study how language access needs and geographic location affect preschool-age children’s access to early elementary gifted and talented programs. The study must evaluate barriers families with limited English proficiency face in learning about, preparing for, and enrolling in these programs, as well as assess the availability of translation, interpretation, and outreach supports. It must also identify disparities in eligibility, nomination, and enrollment by language group and geographic area. A public report with findings and recommendations to improve equitable access would be issued within 6 months.",
