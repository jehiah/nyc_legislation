  "Summary": "This bill would require that the Commissioner of Transportation conduct an annual review to determine whether parking signs should be updated to account for closure or relocation of facilities associated with parking restrictions, like schools, hospitals, and government buildings. The Commissioner of Transportation would have to update parking signs accordingly. This bill would also require the Commissioner of Transportation to consult annually with the Commissioner of Sanitation to evaluate and update alternate side of the street parking signs. Finally, this bill would require that every 5 years, the Commissioner of Transportation conduct a utilization study of commercial vehicle parking areas, issue a report to the Speaker of the Council and the Mayor, and post the report online.",
