  "Summary": "Local Law 89 of 2023 requires that the Department of Sanitation, by April 1, 2024, establish and operate no less than 30 organic waste drop off sites citywide, and ensure that no less than 3 such sites are established in each borough. This bill would clarify that organic waste drop off sites, for the purposes of complying with Local Law 89, cannot be considered to simply be a standalone receptacle for organic or any other waste.",
