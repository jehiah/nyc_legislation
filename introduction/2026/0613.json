  "Summary": "Protected bicycle lanes have been proven to increase cycling and ensure the safety of New Yorkers who depend on cycling for commuting, work, and pleasure. This bill would require the Department of Transportation to increase the pace at which it installs protected bicycle lanes to 100 miles per year for the next six years, providing safe infrastructure for an environmentally friendly transportation method.",
