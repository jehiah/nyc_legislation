  "Summary": "This bill would require the Commission on Civil and Human Rights (CCHR) to establish a hotline with telephone, text, and online capabilities for receiving reports from the public regarding incidents motivated by antisemitic, anti-Asian, and gender-based hate or bias, as well as other forms of hate and bias to be designated by the commission. CCHR would offer hotline users support and referrals as appropriate. CCHR would report the number and, to the extent practicable, severity of hate and bias incidents reported to the hotline, disaggregated by type of bias and by the police precinct where the incident occurred, in its annual report. These numbers would also be published quarterly and annually on CCHR’s website. CCHR would also describe how its outreach work is informed by hotline reports and make recommendations for preventing and addressing antisemitic, anti-Asian, gender-based, and other common or persistent types of hate- and bias-related harms.",
