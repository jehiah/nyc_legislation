  "Summary": "The charter requires pre-approval by the comptroller and corporation counsel of emergency procurements. This bill would limit the term of duration for emergency procurements to 30 days, unless a renewal is approved by the comptroller and corporation counsel. The bill also requires contracts made under emergency procurement procedures to be submitted to the comptroller for audit within 15 days of when the contract is executed in order to be excepted from certain requirements for registration.",
