  "Summary": "This bill would require the Chief Administrative Law Judge of the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings (OATH) to submit an annual report to the Speaker of the Council and the Mayor on notices of violation issued by the Department of Buildings during the preceding 12 months, in connection with which OATH adjourned hearings at least twice. This report would have to detail for each borough: (1) the total number of these notices of violations; (2) a table indicating for each notice of violation the total number of hearing adjournments granted and the address of the property associated with the notice of violation; (3) the percentages of these notices of violation for which the underlying violation was sustained, dismissed, or settled; and (4) the average time, in days, taken by OATH to reach a final decision in connection with these notices of violation.",
