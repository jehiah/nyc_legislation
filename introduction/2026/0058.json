  "Summary": "This bill would require the department of transportation to conduct a study on the impact of last mile facilities on the street infrastructure and communities they are situated in, including estimating the amount of delivery vehicles arriving at or departing from each facility, and the impact that additional vehicle traffic has on parking, street congestion, vehicle collisions and other traffic incidents.",

The term \"delivery vehicle\" means any vehicles, including but not limited to delivery trucks, delivery vans, passenger vehicles, and other motor vehicles, that arrive at or depart from last mile facilities.\n      Last mile facility. The term \"last mile facility\" means a warehouse, storage facility, or other location that receives goods as part of a delivery supply chain, and from which such goods are delivered to their final destination. The term does not include retail businesses where the majority of the premises are used for the purposes of the on-site sale of goods to consumers.\n      b. No later than 2 years after the effective date of this local law, the department shall submit to the speaker of the council, and post conspicuously on the department's website, a report on the impact that delivery vehicle traffic generated by last mile facilities have on the communities they are situated in. Such report shall:\n      1. Identify the location of each last mile facility.\n      2. Estimate the average amount of delivery vehicles arriving at or departing from each such last mile facility on a weekly basis, disaggregated by the type of vehicle including but not limited to delivery trucks, delivery vans, and passenger vehicles.\n      3. Estimate the impact of such delivery vehicle traffic on the street infrastructure within one mile of each such last mile facility, including but not limited to the amount of parking spots occupied by delivery vehicles, traffic delays or congestion attributable to delivery vehicles, vehicular collisions or other traffic incidents involving delivery vehicles, pedestrian injuries or fatalities involving delivery vehicles, and any other impediment to the use of street infrastructure around each such last mile facility that the commissioner determines can be attributed to the presence of the last mile facility and its delivery vehicles when compared to the impact that would be caused by a comparable non-last mile facility business in that area. \n      4. Identify the streets around each last mile facility that are negatively impacted by the presence of each such last mile facility.\n      5. Estimate the cost imposed by such burdens, including but not limited to increased travel time for persons driving in the community in which the last mile facility is located hours of lost productivity due to such increased travel time, or property damage, on the community in which the last mile facility is located.\n      6. Determine what steps may be taken to mitigate such burdens, and estimate the cost to the city to implement those steps.\n      7. Include any other factors the commissioner determines is necessary to better understand the burden that last mile facilities impose on local infrastructure and communities.\n      � 2.
