  "Summary": "This bill would require that the Commissioner of Parks and Recreation identify tree pits located on streets and in landscaped parks and display them on the City's online tree map within 3 years after the effective date of the bill. The Commissioner would thereafter have to update the map annually to reflect changes to tree pits and the creation of new tree pits. The map must note whether each tree pit contains a tree, and if a tree pit does not contain a tree the reason for the disuse of the tree pit.",
