  "Summary": "This bill would require any permit issued by the Department of Transportation (DOT) authorizing the temporary closure of a street to motor vehicle traffic to include a stipulation requiring that the permit holder implement and maintain temporary “no standing” areas or other temporary parking restrictions on the streets surrounding such street closure to facilitate the safe conduct of buses and commercial vehicles. This bill would also require that the permit holder provide notice regarding such parking restriction changes in the affected areas.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Subchapter 1 of chapter 1 of title 19 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 19-107.2 to read as follows:\n      � 19-107.2 Parking restrictions for temporary street closures. a. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms have the following meanings:\n      Bus. The term \"bus\" has the same meaning as such term is defined in the rules of the department, and as may be amended from time to time.\n      Commercial vehicle. The term \"commercial vehicle\" has the same meaning as such term is defined in the rules of the department for purposes of the parking, standing, and stopping rules, and as may be amended from time to time. \n      Surrounding streets. The term \"surrounding streets\" means the streets proximately near a street, or a portion thereof, that is temporarily closed to motor vehicle traffic, such that buses or commercial vehicles would be likely to detour onto such streets during and as a result of such street closure, as determined by the department.\n      b. Any permit issued by the commissioner authorizing the temporary closure of a street, or a portion thereof, to motor vehicle traffic, shall include a stipulation requiring that the applicant implement and maintain temporary \"no standing\" areas or other temporary parking restrictions, through the placement of temporary signs or by any other particular manner as specified by the department, on the surrounding streets of such street closure to facilitate the safe conduct of buses and commercial vehicles. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the commissioner determines that the temporary closure of a street will not result in a significant negative impact on vehicular traffic, or that implementation and maintenance of temporary \"no standing\" areas or other temporary parking restrictions is not feasible on the surrounding streets, the commissioner shall not be required to include such stipulation and such determination shall not prohibit issuance of the permit.\n      c. Following the issuance of a permit that includes a stipulation requiring that the applicant implement and maintain temporary \"no standing\" areas or other temporary parking restrictions, the party to whom the permit is issued shall post notice of such parking restriction changes in the affected areas as soon as practicable. Such notice shall, at a minimum, state the temporary change in the parking restrictions, the date on which such change will take effect, that no notice of violations shall be issued for violations of the temporary parking restrictions, and that if an owner's motor vehicle is missing from the affected streets, the motor vehicle may have been towed and the motor vehicle owner should contact the local police precinct for information about the location of such motor vehicle. Such notice shall not be required where the party to whom the permit is issued is otherwise required to provide notice about such parking changes, including, but not limited to, as required pursuant to subdivisions d or e of section 19-175.2.\n      d. If a permittee violates any stipulation required by subdivision b of this section, the commissioner may revoke or refuse to renew such permit pursuant to subdivision e of section 19-103 or take any other action authorized by law.\n      � 2. This local law takes effect 180 days after it becomes law.\n\n\nTM\nLS #20300\n10/29/25 6:49pm\n\n\n      1\n      \n      \n      1",
