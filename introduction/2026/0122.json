This bill would also require the Department of Transportation to conduct a study on the effectiveness of bollards in high pedestrian traffic areas throughout the City and develop guidelines, no later than six months after the effective date of this local law, to determine whether bollards should be installed during the repair or reconstruction of sidewalks, curb extensions and pedestrian ramps to make them more accessible to pedestrians with a disability, especially in high traffic areas.",
