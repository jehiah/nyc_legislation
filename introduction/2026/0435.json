  "Summary": "This bill would prohibit developers who receive city financial assistance for housing development projects from including pet-restrictive terms in leases. Currently, the Administrative Code invalidates pet-restrictive covenants only if a pet has been held openly and notoriously for three continuous months. This bill would remove this three month safe harbor period and void these provisions in leases for housing development projects that were developed with the use of city financial assistance.",
