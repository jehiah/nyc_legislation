  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Small Business Services (SBS), in consultation with the Office of Resident Economic Empowerment and Sustainability (REES) of the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA), to expand the Business Pathways program for NYCHA residents to encompass businesses beyond catering and childcare, including creative fields, retail and cosmetology. SBS would offer additional business pathways programs at the discretion of the commissioner. SBS would offer the Business Pathways programs free-of-charge. The programs would assist NYCHA residents in formalizing their businesses, including via a professional business education course; mentorship and professional coaching; support in obtaining business licenses; guidance on business operations, marketing and financial structures; funding to complete required health and safety trainings; support in completing provider applications; and help for certain businesses to secure commercial space.",
