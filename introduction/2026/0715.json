  "Summary": "This bill would require the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to create programs to support the pharmaceutical industry in the city, including through workforce development and educational programs. DOHMH would also be required to determine whether it is feasible for the city to establish its own drug stockpile. Finally, DOHMH would be required to report on the state of the pharmaceutical industry in the city, including all open and recently closed pharmacies. It would also be required to add open pharmacies to the NYC Health Map.",
