  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, in collaboration with the Department of City Planning, the Department of Social Services and any other appropriate city agency, to conduct a feasibility study on the establishment of an agency that would focus exclusively on the promotion and development of social housing and report on the findings of the study. The report would address a number of topics, including the governance and funding of the proposed agency, the strategies the agency could use to create new social housing and legal and practical barriers to the establishment of the agency and to the creation of social housing.",
