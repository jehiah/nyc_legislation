  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to regularly report on deaths by suicide in New York City and on suicide-related behaviors among youth. Beginning within six months of the law taking effect, and every year thereafter, the Department would publish a report on suicides in the city, including the total number of deaths and available demographic information such as age group, occupation, race and ethnicity, borough of residence, sex, veteran status, and method of suicide. The bill would also require the Department, beginning within six months of enactment and every two years thereafter, to publish a report on suicide-related behaviors among youth, including information related to sexual orientation and gender identity, to the extent such data is available. Both reports would be required to describe any limitations in the data and to protect individual privacy and law enforcement interests.",
