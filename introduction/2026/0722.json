  "Summary": "This bill would require the Office of Community Mental Health (OCMH), in coordination and consultation with other relevant agencies, to report to the Mayor and Speaker of the Council and online regarding each 911 call that is identified as involving a mental health emergency, on a quarterly basis. The report would include information about responses to these emergencies and would specify whether B-HEARD, the Behavioral Health Emergency Assistance Response Division of OCMH, responded. Additionally, the bill would require the New York City Police Department (NYPD) and New York City Fire Department (FDNY) to include the unique identifiers generated by their respective computer-aided dispatch systems in their 911 call data publication on the Open Data Portal. The NYPD and FDNY would also be required to indicate whether a B-HEARD team was dispatched and able to respond in their 911 call data publication on the Open Data Portal.",
