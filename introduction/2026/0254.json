  "Summary": "This bill would require that building owners provide notice of non-minor construction to tenants in the building where the construction is to occur and in adjacent buildings two weeks before the start of that construction. Notice would not be required where tenants must already receive notice concerning the construction through notice of a tenant protection plan or a safe construction bill of rights. Building owners would have to file the notice with the Office of the Tenant Advocate. The Office of the Tenant Advocate would be required to establish a system to review filed notices and to communicate with tenants who received notice.",
