  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of City Planning (DCP) to conduct an inventory of vacant industrial buildings, vacant land, and vacant ground floor spaces within areas identified by DCP as Significant Maritime Industrial Areas (SMIAs). The inventory would include information like the zoning district, square footage, and development potential for each property. DCP would also be required to estimate the annual zoned economic output capacity of each SMIA, including potential capacity if used for green port water dependent manufacturing, and analyze the feasibility of establishing clean energy research & development centers in underutilized spaces. DCP would be required to review and update the inventory every 5 years and publish the inventory online.",
