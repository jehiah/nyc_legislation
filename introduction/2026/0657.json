  "Summary": "This bill would make amendments to the Third Party Transfer (“TPT”) program. Through the TPT program, the City forecloses on financially and physically distressed properties and transfers them to a third party for rehabilitation. This bill would expand the definition of distressed properties, create additional notice requirements to property owners and building residents, and provide opportunities for building owners to avoid the transfer of their property in particular circumstances, among other changes to the program.",

If you have any questions, you may contact the New York City Department of Finance at (enter telephone number) or visit the Department website at (enter web address).\"\n      The failure of the commissioner of finance to mail such notice shall not affect the validity of any proceeding brought pursuant to this chapter as to any parcel other than the parcel with respect to which notice was not mailed.\n2.

If the property is owned by a housing development fund company organized pursuant to article XI of the private housing finance law, the department of finance shall hold at least 3 meetings with the members of the company to inform them that the property has been included in the list of delinquent taxes and that the property can be removed from such list by entering into a payment plan agreement with the department of finance pursuant to paragraph 2 of subdivision a of section 11-407.\n\t� 10. Section 11-407 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\n\t� 11-407 Redemption. a. After the filing of a list of delinquent taxes and until a date at least [ten] 10 weeks  after the [first publication] service of the [public] notice of foreclosure has been properly effected, as determined by the commissioner of finance and specified in the said notice, a person claiming to have an interest in any parcel in said list may redeem [it] the property by:\n\t1. [paying] Paying all taxes and charges contained in said list of delinquent taxes together with interest and penalties thereon; or\n\t2. (a) Entering into a payment plan agreement with the department of finance and, if applicable, with the department of environmental protection in accordance with the rules prescribed by the New York city water board, pursuant to which, the person claiming to have an interest in such parcel shall be required to remit a payment equal to no less than 20 percent of such delinquent taxes, assessments, or other legal charges, interest, and penalties, together with a sworn statement, in a form to be determined by the commissioner of finance, that the person claiming to have an interest in such parcel has the financial ability to (i) remediate all open hazardous or immediately hazardous violations of record of the housing maintenance code; (ii) continue to maintain the property so as to prevent the existence of further hazardous or immediately hazardous conditions; and (iii) comply with the terms of the payment plan agreement.

Such payment plan shall consolidate all such delinquent taxes, assessments, or other legal charges, interest, and penalties into a single amount owed, regardless of whether such charges were initially owed to separate departments. The person claiming to have an interest in such parcel shall also submit a corrective action plan agreement pursuant to section 11-425; or\n\t(b) If the person claiming to have an interest in such parcel is unable to remit a payment equal to no less than 20 percent of such delinquent taxes, assessments, or other legal charges, interest, and penalties, the applicant shall submit a corrective action plan agreement pursuant to section 11-425 and agree to the appointment of a monitor.\n\tb. Upon such redemption the commissioner of finance shall deliver to the corporation counsel a certificate of redemption. The corporation counsel shall file such certificate with the clerk of the county in which said list was filed. The filing of such certificate shall constitute and be deemed a discontinuance of the in rem action as to the affected parcel, and the county clerk shall thereupon note such redemption and discontinuance in the copy of the list of delinquent taxes maintained by [him or her] the county clerk and adjacent to the county clerk's block index of notices of pendency of action and shall cancel and discharge any notations of the filing of said list of delinquent taxes as to said parcel that may appear in any other books, records, indices, and dockets maintained in said clerk's office. The commissioner of finance shall also deliver a duplicate original certificate of redemption to the person who has redeemed the property and a duplicate certificate of redemption to any occupant in the property who has requested such certificate.\n\tc. 1.

Chapter 4 of title 11 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 11-407.1 to read as follows:\n\t� 11-407.1 Class 1 real property exemption in certain circumstances. A class 1 real property that is a distressed property may be exempted from an in rem foreclosure action pursuant to this chapter when the owner of such property requests such an exemption. The department of finance and the department of housing preservation and development may exempt a property pursuant to this section no more than once. Such class 1 real property is eligible for removal where the owner demonstrates:\n\t\ta. The owner has used such property as their primary residence for an uninterrupted period of not less than 12 months immediately preceding the owner's request for removal, except that a hospitalization or temporary stay in a nursing home or rehabilitation facility for a period of not more than 3 years shall toll the requirement to maintain primary residence for 12 uninterrupted months; and\n \tb. The owner of such property does not own any real property classified as class 1 or class 2 in the city of New York other than the property for which the owner is seeking exemption pursuant to this section.  \n\t� 12. Chapter 4 of title 11 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 11-407.2 to read as follows:\n\t� 11-407.2. Redemption of housing development fund companies. After the filing of a list of delinquent taxes and until a date at least 10 weeks after the service of the notice of foreclosure has been properly effected, as determined by the commissioner of finance and specified in the said notice, a housing development fund company on said list may redeem such housing development fund company if: \n\t1. The housing development fund company enters into a payment plan, with the terms of such payment plan determined by the commissioner of housing preservation and development in conjunction with a monitor approved by such commissioner; and\n\t2. The housing development fund company submits a corrective action plan, pursuant to section 11-425, that shall include but not be limited to establishing milestones for improved cooperative governance, as determined by the commissioner of housing preservation and development in conjunction with a monitor approved by such commissioner. \n\t� 13. Section 11-409 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 37 for the year 1996, is amended to read as follows:\n\t� 11-409 Severance and trial of issues where answer is interposed; [installment] payment plan agreements authorized after action commenced. a. If a duly verified answer is served upon the corporation counsel not later than [twenty] 20 days after the last date for redemption, the answering defendant shall have the right to a severance of the action, as to any parcel in which the defendant has pleaded an interest, upon written demand therefor filed with or made a part of [his or her] the defendant's answer. \n\tb. When such answer is interposed, the court shall summarily hear and determine the issues raised by the complaint and answer in the same manner as it hears and determines other actions, except as herein otherwise provided. Proof that the taxes which made said property subject to foreclosure hereunder together with interest and penalties thereon, were paid before filing of the list of delinquent taxes or that the property was not subject to tax shall constitute a complete defense.\n\tc. [No counterclaim may be asserted in an answer interposed in an action brought pursuant to this chapter. Where a counterclaim is asserted in an in rem answer the city may disregard that portion of the answer and shall suffer no legal penalty or impediment in the prosecution of its in rem action for its failure to reply or respond thereto. Where an answer contains only a counterclaim and no other defenses the city may proceed to judgment of foreclosure against the property affected without the need for moving against the answer. \n\td.] When a verified answer alleges [a substantial] equity [over] of at least 50 percent of the city's lien for taxes, the defendant may demand additional time in which to pay the taxes and interest or to have the property sold with all taxes and interest to be paid out of the proceeds of such sale. Upon such demand a defendant shall have the right to an extension of time for such purpose not in excess of [six months] 180 days from the last day to interpose an answer. Where a mortgagee or lienor who has interposed such answer commences a proceeding to foreclose [his or her] such party's mortgage or lien and it appears that with due diligence such proceeding cannot be concluded in time to allow the payment of taxes within the aforesaid [six month] 180 day period, the court may, on application before the end of said [six month] 180 day period, authorize an additional period during which such proceeding may be concluded and the taxes, together with interest and penalties, paid.\n\t[e.] d. Where an answer of the type described in subdivision [d] c of this section is interposed and taxes are paid within the period set forth in such subdivision [d] c, the commissioner of finance shall issue a certificate of withdrawal as to the property on which such payment has been made pursuant to the provisions of section 11-413 [of this chapter]. When taxes are not paid within the period set forth in such subdivision [d] c, it shall be deemed that there was no equity over the city's tax liens and the answer shall be deemed to be without merit. The city in that event may proceed to judgment of foreclosure against such property without moving against the answer.\n\t[f.] e. All answers interposed in an action hereunder and all affidavits and other papers pertaining to any litigation involving such answers or to any proceeding brought pursuant to this chapter involving less than an entire action shall bear a caption containing the in rem action number of the city's tax foreclosure proceeding, the borough or the section of a tax map or portion of a section of a tax map affected, and if the action covers less than all parcels in an entire borough or section of a tax map or portion of a section of a tax map, the particular class or classes, and the serial, section, block, and lot numbers of the parcel or parcels in issue.\n\t[g.] f. The corporation counsel, when submitting an in rem judgment roll pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, may request a severance as to any parcel on which an in rem answer or litigation is pending, or as to which, before the preparation of said in rem judgment roll is commenced, an agreement was duly made, executed and filed with the commissioner of finance for the payment of the delinquent taxes, assessments, or other legal charges [and], interest, and penalties in installments as provided in subdivision c of section 11-405 [of this chapter] and there has been no default in such agreement as to either quarterly installments or current taxes, assessments, or other legal charges. [Where such an agreement is entered into subsequent to the last date for redemption specified in subdivision a of section 11-407 of this chapter, there shall be paid to the commissioner of finance at the time the aforesaid agreement is executed an amount equal to the penalty which would have been payable under subdivision c of section 11-407 of this chapter had the person executing the agreement made a late redemption payment. Such amount shall be in addition to any installment payments required to be made under the agreement and shall not be credited against any such installment payments. Where a default occurs in such agreement as to either quarterly installments or current  taxes, assessments or other legal charges, all payments made under the agreement shall be forfeited and the city shall be entitled to acquire the parcel as to which the default occurred. Where such default occurs before the submission of the judgment roll, the parcels as to which such default occurs shall be included in said judgment roll among the parcels to be acquired by the city. Where such default has occurred as to a parcel severed pursuant to this subdivision, the corporation counsel shall cause to be entered a supplemental judgment of foreclosure as to such parcel immediately on notification by the commissioner of finance of such default. Where such installment agreement is paid in full the commissioner of finance shall discontinue the in rem action from which said parcel was severed by issuing a certificate of withdrawal as to said parcel pursuant to the provisions of section 11-413 of this chapter. \n\th.] g. 1. A party who has interposed an answer as to any parcel included in an in rem tax foreclosure action, or any other party interested in such parcel, shall have the right, at any time prior to the final disposition of a motion to strike said answer, to pay all taxes, assessments, and other legal charges and interest owing on said parcel. An answering party who makes such payment shall not be required to pay any penalty. [Where such payment is made by other than an answering party after the expiration of the period of redemption, there shall be paid to the commissioner of finance an additional amount equal to the penalty payable under subdivision c of section 11-407 of this chapter.] Where all delinquent taxes, assessments, and other legal charges together with lawful interest thereon [and penalties], where required, are paid, the commissioner of finance shall issue a certificate of withdrawal as to said parcel pursuant to the provisions of section 11-413 [of this chapter]. Said parties may also pay such taxes, assessments, and other legal charges and interest by [an installment agreement] a payment plan agreement upon the approval of the commissioner of housing preservation and development. The commissioner of housing preservation and development, in consultation with the commissioner of finance, may at the commissioner of housing preservation and development's discretion, permit a party to enter into a payment plan agreement for the payment of such taxes, assessments, and other legal charges and interest. [Where such agreement is requested before the preparation of the aforesaid in rem judgment roll is commenced, the terms of said agreement shall be consistent with the provisions of subdivision g or i of this section, whichever is applicable. Where such agreement is requested after judgment of foreclosure has been entered in the in rem action in which the aforesaid answer was interposed, said agreement shall require a first installment of fifty percent of all taxes, assessments and other legal charges and interest owing on said parcel, a penalty of five percent of all such taxes, assessments and other legal charges and interest, which penalty may not exceed one thousand dollars, and the payment of the balance of such taxes, assessments and other legal charges and interest in four equal quarterly installments together with all current taxes, assessments and other legal charges that accrue during such period. The request of an answering party for an installment agreement shall constitute a withdrawal of such party's answer. An installment] A payment plan agreement requested by an interested party other than the answering party shall require the consent of said answering party [which shall also constitute a withdrawal of such party's answer]. The severance provided for in this section shall be continued during the term of all [installment] payment plan agreements entered into pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision. Where a default has occurred as to a parcel severed pursuant to this subdivision, the corporation counsel shall cause to be entered a supplemental judgment of foreclosure as to such parcel immediately on notification by the commissioner of finance of such default. Where such [installment] payment plan agreement is paid in full, the commissioner of finance shall discontinue the in rem action from which said parcel was severed by issuing a certificate of withdrawal as to said parcel pursuant to the provisions of section 11-413 [of this chapter].\n\t2.

The remaining installments, which shall be twice the number of unpaid quarters or real estate taxes or the equivalent thereof but which shall in no event exceed 32 in number, shall be payable quarterly on the first day of July, October, January, and April. The answering party or interested party shall also demonstrate that not less than 75 percent of the conditions that gave rise to the immediately hazardous violations have been corrected. The answering party or interested party shall also submit a corrective action plan agreement pursuant to section 11-425,\n\t[i. (1) Notwithstanding subdivision g of this section, this subdivision shall apply with respect to installment agreements made, executed and filed with the commissioner of finance on or after the date on which this subdivision takes effect. An installment agreement pursuant to this subdivision may be made, executed and filed with such commissioner during the period beginning on the date on which an action is commenced as provided in subdivision d of section 11-405 of this chapter with respect to the parcel that is the subject of such agreement and ending on the date on which such commissioner is advised by the corporation counsel that the preparation of the judgment of foreclosure in such in rem action has been commenced. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, and except to the extent provided in paragraph two of this subdivision, the provisions of paragraphs one through six of subdivision c of section 11-405 of this chapter shall not apply to any installment agreement requested on or after the date on which this subdivision takes effect and on or after the date on which an action is commenced as provided in subdivision d of such section 11-405 with respect to the parcel that is the subject of such requested agreement.\n\t(2) An agreement entered into pursuant to this subdivision shall provide for the payment in installments of the delinquent taxes, assessments and other legal charges, and the interest and penalties thereon, due and owing as of the date on which such agreement is requested. Unless an eligible owner or other interested person requests an agreement pursuant to the provisions of paragraph three of this subdivision, the terms of such agreement with respect to a parcel shall be the same as the terms that would be applicable to such parcel under paragraph four, five or six, as the case may be, of subdivision c of section 11-405 of this chapter, except that, for purposes of the agreement  pursuant  to this paragraph, the amount of the first installment shall be equal to: (i) fifteen percent of the total amount due in the case of a parcel described in such paragraph four; (ii) twenty percent of the total amount due in the case of a parcel described in such paragraph five; and (iii) twenty-five percent of the total amount due in the case of a parcel described in such paragraph six. \n\t(3)] 3.

The first installment thereof shall be paid upon the filing of the [installment] payment plan agreement with the commissioner of finance and shall be in an amount at least equal to, at the applicant's election, [either thirty-five percent or fifty percent] not less than 5 percent of the total amount of such delinquent taxes, assessments, or other legal charges, and the interest and penalties thereon. Such agreement shall include a sworn statement, in a form to be determined by the commissioner of finance, that the eligible owner or other interested party has the financial ability to (i) remediate all open hazardous or immediately hazardous violations of record of the housing maintenance code; (ii) continue to maintain the property so as to prevent the existence of further hazardous or immediately hazardous conditions; and (iii) comply with the terms of the payment plan agreement.

For the purposes of calculating the number of such remaining installments, unpaid real estate taxes that are due and payable on other than a quarterly basis shall be deemed to be payable on a quarterly basis. Such company shall also submit a corrective action plan agreement pursuant to section 11-425.\n\t[(ii) With respect to a parcel, other than a parcel described in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, that is a residential building containing not more than five residential units, a residential condominium unit or a residential building held in a cooperative form of ownership, such agreement shall provide for the payment in installments of the delinquent taxes, assessments and other legal charges, and the interest and penalties thereon, due and owing as of the date on which such agreement is requested. The first installment thereof shall be paid upon the filing of the installment agreement with the commissioner of finance and shall be in an amount at least equal to, at the applicant's election, either twenty-five percent or fifty percent of the total amount of such delinquent taxes, assessments or other legal charges and the interest and penalties thereon. The remaining installments, which shall be three times the number of unpaid quarters of real estate taxes or the equivalent thereof, but which shall in no event exceed twenty in number, shall be payable quarterly on the first days of July, October, January and April together with interest at the rate or rates determined as provided in subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph. For the purposes of calculating the number of such remaining installments, unpaid real estate taxes that are due and payable on other than a quarterly basis shall be deemed to be payable on a quarterly basis. \n\t(iii) With respect to any parcel of class one or class two real property, other than a parcel described in subparagraph (i) or (ii) of this paragraph, such agreement shall provide for the payment in installments of the delinquent taxes, assessments and other legal charges, and the interest and penalties thereon, due and owing as of the date on which such agreement is requested. The first installment thereof shall be paid upon the filing of the installment agreement with the commissioner of finance and shall be in an amount at least equal to, at the applicant's election, either thirty-five percent or fifty percent of the total amount of such delinquent taxes, assessments or other legal charges and the interest and penalties thereon. The remaining installments, which shall be twice the number of unpaid quarters of real estate taxes or the equivalent thereof, but which shall in no event exceed twenty in number, shall be payable quarterly on the first days of July, October, January and April, together with interest at the rate or rates determined as provided in subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph. For the purposes of calculating the number of such remaining installments, unpaid real estate taxes that are due and payable on other than a quarterly basis shall be deemed to be payable on a quarterly basis. \n\t(iv) (A)] (b) (1) Notwithstanding any higher rate of interest prescribed pursuant to applicable law, and unless a lower rate of interest is applicable to a delinquent amount owing on a parcel that is the subject of an agreement pursuant to this paragraph, the interest payable together with the remaining installments due under such agreement shall be calculated at a rate equal to the rate prescribed for the applicable period pursuant to paragraph (i) of subdivision (e) of section 11-224.1 [be: \n\t(I) with respect to an agreement for which a twenty-five percent or thirty-five percent down payment was made, calculated at a rate equal to the sum of (a) the rate prescribed for the applicable period pursuant to paragraph (i) of subdivision e of section 11-224.1 of this title and (b) one-half of the difference between such rate and the rate prescribed for such period pursuant to paragraph (ii) of subdivision e of section 11-224.1 of this title; or \n\t(II) with respect to an agreement for which a fifty percent down payment was made, calculated at a rate equal to the rate prescribed for the applicable period pursuant to paragraph (i) of subdivision e of section 11-224.1 of this title].\n\t[(B)] (2) If a default occurs in any agreement executed pursuant to this paragraph as to either quarterly installments or current taxes, assessments or other legal charges, the rates of interest determined under this subparagraph shall thereupon cease to be applicable and the commissioner of finance shall thereafter charge, collect, and receive interest in the manner and at the rates otherwise prescribed pursuant to law. \n\t[(4)] 4. The corporation counsel, when submitting an in rem judgment roll pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, may request a severance as to any parcel as to which, before the preparation of said in rem judgment roll is commenced, an agreement was duly made, executed, and filed with the commissioner of finance for the payment of all delinquent taxes, assessments, [and] other legal charges, [and] interest, and penalties in installments as provided in this subdivision, and there has been no default in such agreement as to either quarterly installments or current taxes, assessments or other legal charges. [Where such an agreement is entered into subsequent to the last date for redemption specified in subdivision a of section 11-407 of this chapter, there shall be paid to the commissioner of finance at the time such agreements are executed an amount equal to the penalty that would have been payable under subdivision c of section 11-407 of this chapter had the person executing the agreement made a late redemption payment. Such amount shall be in addition to any installment payments required to be made under the agreement and shall not be credited against any such installment payments.] Where a default occurs in such agreement as to either quarterly installments or current taxes, assessments, or other legal charges, all payments made under the agreement shall be [forfeited] refunded to the property owner or other interested party and the city shall be entitled to obtain a judgment hereunder as to the parcel as to which the default occurred. Where such default occurred before the submission of the judgment roll, the parcels as to which such default occurs shall be included in said judgment roll amount the parcels to be acquired by the city or by a third party. Where such default has occurred as to a parcel severed pursuant to this subdivision, the corporation counsel shall cause to be entered a supplemental judgment of foreclosure as to such parcel immediately on notification by the commissioner of finance of such default. Where such [installment] payment plan agreement is paid in full, the commissioner of finance shall discontinue the in rem action from which such parcel was severed by issuing a certificate of withdrawal as to such parcel pursuant to the provisions of section 11-413 [of this chapter].\n\t� 14. Section 11-411 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\n\t� 11-411 Presumption of validity.

A defendant alleging any jurisdictional defect or invalidity in such taxes, assessments or other lawful charges or in the foreclosure thereof must particularly specify in his or her answer such jurisdictional defect or invalidity and must affirmatively establish such defense. A judgment of foreclosure granted in any proceeding brought pursuant to this chapter, which contains recitals that any acts were done or proceedings had which were necessary to give the court jurisdiction or power to grant such judgment of foreclosure, shall be presumptive evidence that such acts were duly performed or proceedings duly had, if such judgment of foreclosure shall have been duly entered or filed in the office of the clerk of the county in which the proceeding was pending and wherein such judgment was granted. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to and be valid and effective with respect to all defendants even though one or more of them be infants, incompetents, absentees or non-residents of the state of New York].\n      � 15. Section 11-412 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 37 for the year 1996, is amended to read as follows: \n      � 11-412 Final judgment. a. The court shall determine upon proof and shall make finding upon such proof whether there has been due compliance by the city with the provisions of this chapter.\n      b. The court shall make a final judgment awarding to the city the possession of any parcel described in the list of delinquent taxes not redeemed or withdrawn as provided in this chapter and as to which no answer is interposed as provided herein. In addition thereto, such judgment shall contain a direction to the commissioner of finance to prepare, execute, and cause to be recorded a deed conveying to the city full and complete title to such lands. Upon the execution of such deed, the city shall be seized of an estate in fee simple absolute in such land and all persons, including the state of New York, infants, persons judicially declared to be incapable of managing their own affairs [incompetents], absentees, and non-residents who may have had any right, title, interest, claim, lien, or equity of redemption in or upon such lands shall be barred and forever foreclosed of all such right, title, interest, claim, lien, or equity of redemption, except as otherwise provided in section 11-424 [of this chapter]. The appointment and tenure of receivers, trustees, or any other persons, including administrators under article [seven-A] 7-A of the real property actions and proceedings law, appointed by an order of a court to manage real property, shall terminate when title to such property vests in the city pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. After such termination, said receivers, trustees, or administrators shall be accountable to the courts that appointed them for the faithful performance of their fiduciary obligations during the term of their appointment and to the city for any rents and income received by them for any period subsequent to the date of the vesting of title in the city. [If the city serves a tenant in possession of a dwelling unit with notice of termination of tenancy on grounds other than non-payment of rent, the acceptance of rent for the first forty-five 45 days after termination of tenancy by anyone other than an employee of the department designated by the department to receive such rent shall not be deemed or construed as a waiver of the city's right to initiate and prosecute a proceeding to terminate the tenancy for good cause.]\n      c. Every deed given pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be presumptive evidence that the action and all proceedings therein and all proceedings prior thereto from and including the assessment of the lands affected and all notices required by law were regular and in accordance with all provisions of law relating thereto. After [two] 2 years from the date of the recording of such deed, the presumption shall be conclusive, unless at the time that this subdivision takes effect the [two] 2 year period since the recording of the deed has expired or less than [six months] 180 days of such period of [two] 2 years remains unexpired, in which case the presumption shall become conclusive [six months] 180 days after this subdivision takes effect. No action to set aside such deed may be maintained unless the action is commenced and a notice of pendency of the action is filed in the office of the proper county clerk prior to the time that the presumption becomes conclusive as aforesaid.\n      � 16. Section 11-412.1 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 37 for the year 1996, is amended to read as follows:\n      � 11-412.1 Special procedures relating to final judgment and release of class [one] 1 and class [two] 2 real property.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary:\n      a. The court shall determine upon proof and shall make a finding upon such proof whether there has been due compliance by the city with the applicable provisions of this chapter.\n      b. [(1)] 1. The court shall make a final judgment authorizing the award of possession of any parcel of class [one] 1 or class [two] 2 real property described in the list of delinquent taxes not redeemed or withdrawn as provided in this chapter and as to which no answer is interposed as provided herein, and authorizing the commissioner of finance to prepare, execute, and cause to be recorded a deed conveying either to the city or to a third party deemed qualified and designated by the commissioner of housing preservation and development full and complete title to such lands. Any such conveyance to a third party shall be for an existing use. As consideration for such conveyance, the third party shall be required to execute a regulatory agreement with the department of housing preservation and development, with the requirements of such regulatory agreement determined by such department to address the specific needs of such property. Such regulatory agreement shall include protections for tenants of such property, including but not limited to affordability based on the tenant's income, eviction protections, and lease renewals. \n      [(2)] 2. Such third party shall be deemed qualified and shall be designated pursuant to such criteria as are established in rules promulgated by the commissioner of housing preservation and development, provided, however, that such criteria shall include but not be limited to: residential management experience; financial ability; rehabilitation experience; ability to work with government and community organizations; neighborhood ties; and that the commissioner shall consider whether the third party is a responsible legal tenant, not-for-profit organization [or], neighborhood-based-for-profit individual or organization, or community land trust. The commissioner shall not deem qualified any third party who has been finally adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction, within [seven] 7 years of the date on which such third party would otherwise be deemed qualified, to have violated any section of articles [one hundred fifty] 150, [one hundred seventy-five] 175, [one hundred seventy-six] 176, [one hundred eighty] 180, [one hundred eighty-five] 185, or [two hundred] 200 of the penal law or any similar laws of another jurisdiction, or who has been suspended or debarred from contracting with the city or any agency of the city pursuant to section 335 of the charter during the period of such suspension or debarment. The rules promulgated by the commissioner pursuant to this paragraph may establish other bases for disqualification of a third party.\n      [c.] 3. Following the expiration of the [four-month] 180 day period prescribed in subdivision d of this section, but not more than [eight] 8 months]  after the date on which, pursuant to subdivision b of this section, the final judgment authorizing the award of possession of a parcel of class [one] 1 or class [two] 2 real property was entered, the commissioner of finance may execute a deed, pursuant to [subdivision b] paragraph 2 of this [section] subdivision, with respect to such parcel. The owner of said parcel shall continue to have all of the rights, liabilities, responsibilities, duties, and obligations of an owner of such parcel, including, but not limited to, maintaining such parcel in compliance with the housing maintenance, building, and fire codes, and all other applicable laws, unless and until the commissioner of finance has prepared and executed a deed conveying to the city or to a third party full and complete title to such parcel.

The appointment and tenure of receivers, trustees, or any other persons, including administrators under article seven-A of the real property actions and proceedings law, appointed by an order of a court to manage real property, shall terminate when title to such property vests in the city or a third party pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. After such termination, said receivers, trustees, or administrators shall be accountable to the courts that appointed them for the faithful performance of their fiduciary obligations during the term of their appointment and to the city or such third party for any rents and income received by them for any period subsequent to the date of the vesting of title in the city or such third party. [If the city serves a tenant in possession of a dwelling unit with notice of termination of tenancy on grounds other than nonpayment of rent, the acceptance of rent for the first forty-five days after termination of tenancy by anyone other than an employee of the department designated by the department to receive such rent shall not be deemed or construed as a waiver of the city's right to initiate and prosecute a proceeding to terminate the tenancy for good cause.]\n      d.

Such agreement shall require[, in addition to full payment of the penalty specified in this subdivision at the time such agreement is entered into,] the payment at such time of a first installment equal to [fifty] 50 percent of all taxes, assessments, and other legal charges, and the lawful interest thereon, then owing on such parcel, and the payment of the balance of such taxes, assessments, and other legal charges and interest in [four] 4 equal quarterly installments together with all current taxes, assessments, and other legal charges that accrue during such period, together with a sworn statement in a form to be determined by the department of finance that the person claiming to have an interest in such parcel has the financial ability to (i) remediate all open hazardous or immediately hazardous violations of record of the housing maintenance code; (ii) continue to maintain the property so as to prevent the existence of further hazardous or immediately hazardous conditions; and (iii) comply with the terms of the payment plan agreement. The applicant shall also submit a corrective action plan agreement pursuant to section 11-425. Upon receipt of payment in full of the amount specified in the first sentence of this subdivision, the commissioner of finance shall direct the corporation counsel to prepare and cause to be entered an order discontinuing the in rem tax foreclosure action as to said property, cancelling the notice of pendency of such action as to said property, and vacating and setting aside the final judgment. Upon the execution of [an installment] a payment plan agreement and payment of the amounts due at the time such agreement is executed as provided in this subdivision, the commissioner of finance shall direct the corporation counsel to prepare and cause to be entered an order vacating and setting aside the final judgment. The entry of either such order shall restore all parties, including owners, mortgagees, and any and all lienors, receivers, [and] administrators, and encumbrancers, to the status they held immediately before such final judgment was entered.

Upon receipt of all the amounts required to be paid pursuant to this subdivision, the commissioner of finance shall direct the corporation counsel to prepare and cause to be entered an order discontinuing the in rem tax foreclosure action as to said property, cancelling the notice of pendency of such action as to said property, and vacating and setting aside the final judgment entered pursuant to subdivision b of this section and the deed executed and recorded pursuant to such final judgment as to said property. The entry of such order shall restore all parties, including owners, mortgagees, and any and all lienors, receivers, [and] administrators, and encumbrancers, to the status they held immediately before the final judgment was entered, as if the in rem tax foreclosure had never taken place, and shall render said property liable for all taxes, deficiencies, management fees, and liens which shall accrue subsequent to those paid in order to obtain the release provided for in this subdivision, or which were, for whatever reason, omitted from the payment made to obtain said release.\n      f.

The application of such owner shall [be accompanied by the nonrefundable fee required by paragraph four of subdivision b of section 11-424 of this chapter and shall] contain, in addition to the statements, searches, and proofs required by subdivision e of this section, a statement that an exemption under the real property tax law is being claimed. Such application shall also state either that it is accompanied by the written certificate of the comptroller setting forth the precise period during which said property, while owned by such application, and during the period after the city's acquisition up to the date of the certificate if said property was still being used for an exempt purpose after said acquisition, was entitled to an exemption and the exact nature and extent of such exemption, or that an application for such written certificate has been filed with the comptroller. On issuing such written certificate, the comptroller shall cancel those tax items which have accrued during the period covered by the certificate to the extent the applicant is entitled to an exemption as set forth in the certificate. A release of the city's interest may be authorized only at the discretion of the in rem foreclosure release board and, except as otherwise provided in paragraph [four] 4 of subdivision e of this section, subject to all the restrictions set forth in subdivision g of section 11-424 [of this chapter]. A release to an exempt applicant shall be effected only after said applicant has paid all of the amounts required to be paid by subdivision d of section 11-424 [of this chapter], except for those tax items which have been canceled, in whole or in part, pursuant to the comptroller's certificate, within [thirty] 30 days of the date on which the letter requesting payment is mailed or delivered to the applicant.\n      g.

If the commissioner of finance has prepared, executed, and caused to be recorded a deed conveying to a third party full and complete title to a parcel of class [one] 1 or class [two] 2 real property acquired by in rem tax foreclosure, the provisions contained in subdivisions e and f of this section for the release of property so acquired shall not be available.\n      h. Every deed given pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be presumptive evidence that the action and all proceedings therein and all proceedings prior thereto from and including the assessment of the lands affected and all notices required by law were regular and in accordance with all provisions of law relating thereto. After [four months] 180 days from the date of entry of the final judgment authorizing the award of possession of any parcel of class [one] 1 or class [two] 2 real property pursuant to the provisions of this section, the presumption shall be conclusive. No action to set aside such deed may be maintained unless the action is commenced and a notice of pendency of the action is filed in the office of the property county clerk prior to the time that the presumption becomes conclusive as aforesaid. Should any lawsuit or proceeding be commenced to set aside a deed conveying to a third party a parcel of class [one] 1 or class [two] 2 real property pursuant to the provisions of this section, such third party shall send to the corporation counsel within [ten] 10 days of their receipt a copy of any papers served on such third party in such lawsuit or proceeding.\n      i. If the commissioner of finance does not execute a deed conveying to the city or to a third party a parcel of class one or class two real property within [eight] 8 months after the entry of final judgment authorizing the award of possession of such parcel pursuant to subdivision b of this section, the commissioner of finance shall direct the corporation counsel to prepare and cause to be entered an order discontinuing the in rem foreclosure action as to said property, canceling the notice of pendency of such action as to said property, and vacating and setting aside said final judgment. The entry of such order shall restore all parties, including owners, mortgagees, and any and all lienors, receivers, [and] administrators, and encumbrancers, to the status they held immediately before such final judgment was entered.\n      j. If the commissioner of finance directs the corporation counsel, pursuant to subdivision i of this section, to prepare and cause to be entered an order discontinuing the in rem foreclosure action with respect to a parcel of class [one] 1 or class [two] 2 real property determined to be a distressed property [pursuant to section 11-401.1 of this chapter], the commissioner of housing preservation and development shall evaluate the parcel determined to be a distressed property and take such action as [he or she] the commissioner of housing preservation and development deems appropriate under the programs, existing at the time of such evaluation, that are designed to encourage the rehabilitation and preservation of existing housing, and shall monitor or cause to be monitored the status of the property. The commissioner of housing preservation and development shall maintain a register of properties determined to be distressed properties.\n      � 17.

Within [forty-five] 45 days of such notification, the council may act by local law approving or disapproving the proposed conveyance.

Section 11-413 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\n      � 11-413 Withdrawal of parcels from foreclosure. a. The commissioner of finance [may] shall, prior to final judgment, withdraw a parcel from a proceeding under this chapter for any of the following reasons, [(1)] (i) a question which the commissioner deems meritorious has been raised as to the validity of the tax liens affecting the parcel[, (2)]; (ii) the city collector has accepted a payment of all taxes and interest which rendered the parcel subject to foreclosure hereunder because the records in the commissioner's office indicated that the principal amount of such taxes was exceeded by the principal amount of subsequent taxes which would not have rendered the parcel subject to foreclosure hereunder and which had been paid prior to the commencement of said proceeding; or [(3)] (iii) in cases where the tax foreclosure action cannot be maintained such as, but not limited thereto, where the charges which rendered a parcel subject to foreclosure hereunder have been cancelled or were paid before the commencement of the foreclosure proceeding but such payment was not reported or did not clear for payment until after the commencement of said proceeding, or where a name and address appearing on an owner's registration [card or an in rem card] filed pursuant to section 11-416 or 11-417 [of this chapter] and contained in the files of the city collector did not appear in the mailing list used by the commissioner of finance for mailing notices of foreclosure in such proceeding.\n      b. To effectuate such withdrawal the commissioner of finance shall deliver a certificate of withdrawal to the corporation counsel who shall file it in the office of the county clerk in which the list of delinquent taxes was filed. The filing of such certificate with such county clerk shall effect a discontinuance of the tax foreclosure action as to the affected parcel, and the county clerk shall thereupon note such withdrawal and discontinuance in the copy of the list of delinquent taxes maintained by [him or her] the county clerk adjacent to the county clerk's block index of notices of pendency of action and shall cancel and discharge any and all notations of the filing of said list of delinquent taxes as to said parcel that may appear in any other books, records, indices, and dockets maintained in said clerk's office. \n      c. The commissioner of finance shall also deliver a duplicate original certificate of withdrawal to the person entitled to such withdrawal and a notification of such withdrawal, containing the reason for withdrawal by first class mail, electronic mail, and text message, to the extent practicable, to the owner of the building and the occupant of each dwelling unit of such property, and by posting in the property's common area that the property is no longer subject to foreclosure under this chapter.\n      d. The commissioner of finance shall recite the parcels so withdrawn and the reasons for withdrawal in an affidavit of regularity to be submitted by the commissioner in each action brought pursuant to this chapter.\n      e. The commissioner of finance shall issue a certificate of withdrawal whenever taxes and interest are paid, cancelled, liquidated, or otherwise lawfully disposed of as to any parcel which was previously severed pursuant to section 11-409 [of this chapter] because an answer or litigation was pending.\n      � 19. Section 11-416 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 82 for the year 2024, is amended to read as follows:\n      � 11-416 Mailing tax bills and notices to owners of real property. a. The commissioner of finance shall mail bills for taxes, charges, and assessments to all owners who have notified the commissioner of finance in writing or electronically of the owner's mailing address for communications from the commissioner, at the address so provided, or, if no mailing address has been so provided, to the owner of record at the property address, if any, appearing in the latest assessment roll, but the failure of the commissioner of finance so to mail such bill shall not invalidate or otherwise affect the tax, charge, or assessment represented thereby nor prevent the accruing of any interest or penalty imposed for the [non-payment] nonpayment thereof, nor prevent or stay proceedings under this chapter, nor affect the title of the plaintiff or any purchaser under such proceedings.\n      b. The commissioner of finance shall also mail notice of foreclosure and any other process required by this chapter to all owners who have notified the commissioner of finance in writing or electronically of the owner's mailing address for communications from the commissioner, at an address so provided, whenever a property is included in a list of delinquent taxes filed pursuant to this chapter. The failure to receive such notice or process as herein provided shall not affect the validity of any action or proceeding brought pursuant to this chapter. \n      � 20. Section 11-417 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 82 for the year 2024, is amended to read as follows:\n      � 11-417 Mailing notices to other interested persons. The commissioner of finance shall mail a notice of foreclosure and any other process required by this chapter to each person  who is not entitled to have tax bills mailed to such person by the commissioner of finance, but who has notified the commissioner of finance in writing or electronically that he or she has an interest in real property, including the interest of a mortgagee, lienor, or encumbrancer, and who has requested the commissioner of finance to mail a notice to [him or her] such person at a designated mailing address, at the address so provided, whenever the property in which the person has an interest is included in a list of delinquent taxes filed pursuant to this chapter. However, failure to receive such notice or process shall not affect the validity of any proceeding brought pursuant to this chapter.\n      � 21. Section 11-424 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 59 for the year 1996, is amended to read as follows:\n      � 11-424 Application to the city for release of property acquired by in rem tax foreclosure. a. [(1)] 1. The city's interest in property acquired by in rem tax foreclosure may be released pursuant to this section on the application of any party who had an interest in said property as either owner, mortgagee, lienor, or encumbrancer at the time of the city's acquisition thereof where such application is made at any time up to [two] 2 years from the date on which the deed by which the city acquired title to said property was recorded. \n      [(2)] 2. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of paragraph [one] 1 of this subdivision to the contrary, the city's interest in property acquired by in rem tax foreclosure may be released pursuant to this section upon application of any party who had an interest in said property as either owner, mortgagee, lienor, or encumbrancer at the time of the city's acquisition thereof where such application is made more than [two] 2 years after the date on which the deed by which the city acquired title to said property was recorded provided such application is authorized by the council as hereinafter provided. An application for such release and the documents required by subdivision c of this section in support thereof shall be filed with the department of citywide administrative services in the manner provided in subdivision b of this section. The department of citywide administrative services shall give the council written notice of the receipt of each such filing. After review and approval of the application by the corporation counsel as to form and eligibility of the applicant, the department of citywide administrative services shall send a copy of such application to the in rem foreclosure release board and to the council. Upon receipt of such application, the in rem foreclosure release board shall take no further action on such application unless the council adopts a resolution within [one hundred twenty] 120 days following the first stated meeting of the council after receipt of such application authorizing the board to consider such application. If the council fails to adopt a resolution within such [one-hundred-twenty-day] 120 day period, the council shall be deemed to have denied its authorization for the board to consider such application. A resolution of the council pursuant to this paragraph shall describe the property for which release is sought by borough, tax map, block, and lot number and shall specify that release of the city's interest in such property is subject to the approval of the in rem foreclosure release board and to all the conditions and restrictions set forth in this section.\n      3. The city's interest in property acquired by in rem tax foreclosure may be released pursuant to this section at the discretion of the commissioner of housing preservation and development to the owner of the property at the time of the city's acquisition thereof if such acquisition occurred as the result of an administrative or clerical error.\n      b. [1.] Any such application shall be made in writing to the commissioner of citywide administrative services and shall be verified. It shall contain the name and address of the applicant and shall state the date on which and the in rem action by which the city acquired title to the property sought to be released. It shall also contain a statement specifying the nature of the applicant's interest in the property and a full description of the instrument from which the applicant's interest derives including the date of execution, the date and place of the recording or entry of said instrument, and the parties thereto. In the event the applicant's interest arises by reason of the death of a prior owner, mortgagee, lienor, or encumbrancer, then the application shall also state the applicant's relationship to said decedent and shall include whatever additional information may be necessary to prove the applicant's right to make such application. \n      [2. A fee of two hundred seventy-five dollars shall be paid on the submission of any such application which is subject to the provisions of subdivision f of this section, except that the fee for any such application for the release of property improved by a one or two-family dwelling shall be one hundred dollars. \n      3. A fee of five hundred fifty dollars shall be paid on the submission of any such application which is subject to the provisions of subdivision g of this section, except that the fee for any such application for the release of property improved by a one or two-family dwelling shall be one hundred dollars. \n      4. A fee of two hundred seventy-five dollars shall be paid on the submission of any such application which is subject to the provisions of subdivision h of this section within four months from the date on which the deed by which the city acquired title to the subject property was recorded, and a fee of five hundred and fifty dollars shall be paid on the submission of any such application which is subject to the provisions of such subdivision not within four months from such date; except that the fee for any such application which is subject to the provisions of such subdivision for the release of property improved by a one or two-family dwelling shall be one hundred dollars. \n      5. The fees payable pursuant to paragraphs two, three and four of this subdivision shall not be refundable. \n      6. In addition to the fees specified in paragraphs two, three and four of this subdivision, there shall be paid on the submission of any application which is subject to this section an amount at least equal to the lesser of nine hundred dollars or the sum specified in paragraph one of subdivision d of this section, which amount shall not be refundable, but shall be applied in reduction of the sum specified in paragraph one of subdivision d of this section; provided, however, that if a release requires the authorization of the in rem foreclosure release board, and such authorization is not given, such additional amount shall be refunded to the applicant.]\n      c. Each application shall be supported by the certified search of the city register or by an official letter, certificate, or certified search of any title insurance, or abstract company, organized and doing business under the laws of this state. Such supporting instruments shall recite the recording data both as to the deed by which the city acquired title to the parcel sought to be released and the instrument from which the applicant's interest derives. In the event the applicant's interest does not appear of record but is derived by the death of an owner, mortgagee, lienor, or encumbrancer of record, then the application shall also be supported by the affidavit of the applicant or other person having information thereof, or by the duly written certificate or certification of the county clerk or the clerk of any surrogate's or other court of record, or by any other instrument or document required by the corporation counsel to substantiate the applicant's right to file such application in compliance with the provisions of this section.\n      d. The city's interest shall be released only after payment, as to each parcel to be released, of the following sums of money: \n      1. The principal amount due on all unpaid taxes, assessments, water charges, and sewer rents appearing on the list of delinquent taxes and accruing thereafter together with interest at the rate or rates provided by law. \n      2. [Five percent of the amount paid pursuant to the preceding paragraph but not exceeding one thousand dollars for each parcel. \n      3.]  Any deficiency which may result to the city after all payments made by it for the repair, maintenance, and operation of the lands, real estate, or real property shall have been charged or debited in the appropriate accounts of the city and all rents, license fees, and other moneys collected by the city as a result of its operation of the said lands, real estate, or real property shall have been credited in such accounts. Any contract for repair, maintenance, management, or operation made by the city on which it shall be liable, although payment thereon shall not have been made, shall be deemed a charge or debit to such accounts as though payment had been made. The amounts paid and collected by the city as shown in its accounts and the necessity for making the several payments and contracts to be charged as herein provided shall be conclusive upon the applicant. Where a deficiency under this [subdivision] paragraph shall be created or increased by the failure of the city to collect rents, license fees, or other moneys to which the city may have been entitled, the right to collect or to bring action for the same shall be assigned, transferred, and set over to the applicant by an instrument in writing. \n      [4. Any and all costs and disbursements which shall have been awarded to the city or to which it may have become entitled by operation of law or which it may have paid or become liable for payment in connection with any litigation between it and the applicant or any person having an estate or interest in the lands, real estate or real property to be released resulting directly or indirectly from the foreclosure by action in rem of the delinquent taxes affecting said lands, real estate or real property. \n      5.] 3. A reasonable monthly fee to be determined by the city, through the department of citywide administrative services, for management services and operations of the lands, real estate, or real property by the city prior to the release of said lands, real estate, or property. \n      [6.] 4. The city, through the department of citywide administrative services, shall also require as additional consideration for such release, the payment of all arrears on mortgages held by the city and all liens accruing to it by operation of law including but not limited to relocation and emergency repair liens. \n      e. The corporation counsel shall effect the release of the city's interest in property acquired by in rem tax foreclosure, as provided for in this section, by preparing and causing to be entered an order discontinuing the in rem tax foreclosure action as to said property, cancelling the notice of pendency of such action as to said property, and vacating and setting aside the in rem judgment of foreclosure and the deed executed and recorded pursuant to such judgment of foreclosure as to said property. The entry of such order shall restore all parties, including owners, mortgagees, and any and all lienors, receivers and administrators, and encumbrancers, to the status they held at the time the city acquired title to said property, as if the in rem tax foreclosure had never taken place, and shall render said property liable for all taxes, deficiencies, management fees, and liens which shall accrue subsequent to those paid in order to obtain the release provided for in this section, or which were, for whatever reason, omitted from the payment made to obtain said release.\n      f. If an application pursuant to this section, and the documents required by subdivision c of this section in support thereof, are filed within [four] 4 months after the date of the city's acquisition of the subject property, said application shall be granted [providing] provided the corporation counsel approves the application as to form, timeliness, and eligibility of the applicant and [providing] provided the applicant has paid all amounts required to be paid by subdivision d of this section within [thirty] 30 days of the date on which a letter requesting the applicant to make such payment is mailed or delivered to the applicant. The city shall not sell or assign any property acquired by in rem tax foreclosure within [four] 4 months of said acquisition but this provision shall not prevent the city from authorizing condemnation of such property or vesting title thereto in a condemnation proceeding during said [four] 4 month period. In the event an application pursuant to this section is filed within [four] 4 months of the city's acquisition by in rem tax foreclosure and title to the subject property vests in condemnation before the city's interest therein has been released by the vacate order provided for herein, the applicant shall be entitled to the condemnation award for such property without the entry of such vacate order, providing the corporation counsel has approved the application as aforesaid and [providing] provided that the amounts specified in subdivision d of this section, if not previously paid, are deducted from said condemnation award, with taxes apportioned to the date of the condemnation title vesting.\n      g. If an application for a release of the city's interest in property acquired by in rem tax foreclosure, and the documents required by subdivision c of this section in support thereof, have been filed within the time allowed in paragraph [one] 1 of subdivision a of this section, but more than [four months] 180 days after the date of the city's acquisition or if an application for such release has been authorized by a resolution of the council pursuant to paragraph [two] 2 of subdivision a of this section and such application and the documents required by subdivision c of this section in support thereof have been filed, the in rem foreclosure release board may, in its discretion, authorize the release of the city's interest in said property pursuant to this section, provided that the application has been approved by the corporation counsel as to form, timeliness, and eligibility of the applicant and provided that the city has not sold or otherwise disposed of said property and provided, further, that said property has not been condemned or assigned to any agency of the city and is not the subject of contemplated use for any capital or urban renewal project of the city. The corporation counsel shall effect such discretionary release only where the applicant, after the board's authorization of the release, has paid all the amounts required to be paid by subdivision d of this section within [thirty] 30 days of the date on which a letter requesting the applicant to make such payment is mailed or delivered to the applicant. The in rem foreclosure release board may also, in its discretion, authorize a release of the city's interest in such property, pursuant to the above provisions, whenever an application for such release, approved as to form, timeliness, and eligibility by the corporation counsel, has been filed at any time during the period allowed in subdivision a of this section in which the applicant has requested [an installment] payment plan agreement of the commissioner of citywide administrative services for the payment of the amounts required to be paid by subdivision d of this section, provided that said commissioner has approved such request. The commissioner of citywide administrative services shall not approve any such request unless the applicant shall have given notice by certified mail to each tenant located on the parcel, of the request and shall have given such commissioner an affidavit stating that such notice has been provided, within [thirty] 30 days after the request. Any false statement in such affidavit shall not in any way affect the validity of the agreement, be grounds for its cancellation, or in any way affect the release of the city's interest in the parcel. Such agreement shall require, in addition to full payment of the amounts due under paragraphs [two] 2, [three] 3, [four] 4, [five] 5, and [six] 6 of subdivision d of this section, a first installment of [fifty] 20 percent of the amount due under paragraph [one] 1 of said subdivision d with the balance of said amount to be paid in [four] 4 equal quarterly installments together with all current taxes, assessments, or other legal charges that accrue during such period; provided, however, that: (i) whenever a request for [an installment] a payment plan agreement is made of the commissioner of citywide administrative services by a company organized pursuant to article XI of the private housing finance law with the consent and approval of the department of housing preservation and development, or for a parcel which is an owner-occupied residential building of not more than [five] 5 residential units, the commissioner of citywide administrative services may, as to that portion of the amounts due under paragraph [one] 1 of subdivision d of this section which became due prior to the acquisition by the article XI company of its interest in the property and as to the amount due under paragraph [one] 1 of subdivision d of this section in the case of such an owner-occupied building, approve a reduction of such first installment to an amount not less than [ten] 10 percent of the amount due under paragraph [one] 1 of subdivision d of this section and an increase in the number of the following equal quarterly installments to a number which shall be equal to [three] 3 times the number of unpaid quarters of real estate taxes or the equivalent thereof but which shall in no event exceed [forty-eight] 48, and (ii) notwithstanding the preceding clause, whenever an installment agreement is requested on or after the date on which this clause takes effect with respect to a parcel that, immediately prior to the city's acquisition thereof by in rem tax foreclosure, was owned by a company organized pursuant to article XI of the [state] private housing finance law with the consent and approval of the department of housing preservation and development, or with respect to a parcel that is a residential building containing not more than [five] 5 residential units, a residential condominium unit, or a residential building held in a cooperative form of ownership, the commissioner of [general] administrative services may, as to the amount due under paragraph [one] 1 of subdivision d of this section, approve [an installment] a payment plan agreement containing the terms relating to the required percentage payment for the first installment and the required number of subsequent quarterly installments[, that would be applicable to such parcel under paragraph two (but without regard to any reference therein to paragraph three) of subdivision i of section 11-409 of this chapter]. For purposes of calculating the number of such following equal quarterly installments, unpaid real estate taxes, or the equivalent which are[, on and after July first, nineteen hundred eighty-two,] due and payable on an other than quarterly basis shall be deemed to be payable on a quarterly basis. Where the in rem foreclosure release board denies an application requesting [an installment] a payment plan agreement, the board shall authorize a release of the city's interest, provided that the applicant thereafter pays all the amounts required to be paid by subdivision d of this section within [thirty] 30 days of the date on which a letter requesting such payment is mailed or delivered to the applicant only when said application and the documents required by subdivision c of this section in support thereof were filed within [thirty] 30 days of the date of the city's acquisition of the property sought to be released. Where the in rem foreclosure release board denies an application requesting [an installment] a payment plan agreement which was filed more than [thirty] 30 days after the date of the city's acquisition, the board may, in its discretion, authorize a release of the city's interest, provided that the applicant thereafter pays all the amounts required to be paid by subdivision d of this section within [thirty] 30 days of the date on which a letter requesting such payment is mailed or delivered to the applicant. Where the in rem foreclosure release board approves an application requesting [an installment] a payment plan agreement, the order releasing the city's interest shall provide that in the event of any default as to the payment of either quarterly installments or current taxes, assessments, or other legal charges during the term of such agreement, as set forth in the board's resolution, all payments made under said agreement shall be refunded and the city shall be entitled to reacquire the property so released. The corporation counsel shall effect such reacquisition by causing to be entered as to such property a supplemental judgment of foreclosure in the in rem action by which said property was originally acquired immediately on notification by the commissioner of finance of such default.\n      h. An owner of property entitled to an exemption under any of the provisions of article [four] 4 of the real property tax law during all or part of the period covered by the tax items appearing on a list of delinquent taxes may apply for a release of the city's interest in such exempt property under the provisions of this section during the periods of time set forth herein and for an additional period up to [ten] 10 years from the date of the city's acquisition of said property by in rem foreclosure. The application of such owner shall contain, in addition to the statements, searches, and proofs required by this section, a statement that an exemption under the real property tax law is being claimed. Such application shall also state either that it is accompanied by the written certificate of the comptroller setting forth the precise period during which said property, while owned by such applicant, and during the period after the city's acquisition up to the date of the certificate if said property was still being used for an exempt purpose after said acquisition, was entitled to an exemption and the exact nature and extent of such exemption or that an application for such written certificate has been filed with the comptroller. On issuing such written certificate, the comptroller shall cancel those tax items which have accrued during the period covered by the certificate to the extent the applicant is entitled to an exemption as set forth in the certificate. Where an application by an exempt owner is filed more than [four months] 120 days after the date of the city's acquisition of the subject property, a release of the city's interest may be issued only at the discretion of the in rem foreclosure release board and subject to all the restrictions set forth in the preceding subdivision. A release to an exempt applicant shall be effected only after said applicant has paid all the amounts required to be paid by subdivision d of this section, except for those tax items which have been cancelled, in whole or in part, pursuant to the comptroller's certificate, within [thirty] 30 days of the date on which a letter requesting payment is mailed or delivered to the applicant.\n      i. The corporation counsel shall also effect the release of the city's interest in property acquired by in rem foreclosure, as provided for in this action, whenever the commissioner of finance shall accept as to any parcel so acquired, the payment provided for in [paragraph two] item (ii) of subdivision a of section 11-413 [of this chapter]. Said commissioner may accept such payment at any time within [four months] 120 days of the date of the city's acquisition and may further, subject to the approval of the in rem foreclosure release board, accept such payment at any time more than [four months] 120 days after the date of the city's acquisition but less than [two] 2 years from the date on which the city's deed was recorded [providing] provided said property has not been sold or otherwise disposed of nor condemned or assigned to any agency of the city and is not the subject of contemplated use of any capital or urban renewal project of the city.\n\t� 22. Section 11-425 of the administrative code of the city of New York is REPEALED and a new section 11-425 is added to read as follows:\n\t� 11-425 Corrective action plans. a. Prior to a judgment of foreclosure, the owner of a distressed property that has open hazardous and immediately hazardous violations shall submit to the department of housing preservation and development for approval a corrective action plan consisting of the following: (i) the names of any contractors retained by such owner to clear any outstanding hazardous or immediately hazardous violations; (ii) the date by which the condition that gave rise to the hazardous or immediately hazardous violation is expected to be remediated; and (iii) any funding obtained by such owner to clear any hazardous or immediately hazardous violations. The department of housing preservation and development shall provide approval or disapproval of the corrective action plan within 45 days of receipt of such plan. Should the department of housing preservation and development decline to approve a corrective action plan, such department may provide an explanation why the plan was not approved and may provide an option to resubmit an amended corrective action plan for approval.\n\tb. After a judgment of foreclosure, the owner of a distressed property that has open hazardous and immediately hazardous violations shall submit to the department of housing preservation and development for approval an updated corrective action plan demonstrating steps taken to address such violations. Such department shall promulgate rules establishing the documentation such department will accept for purposes of the updated corrective action plan.  \n\t� 23. Section 11-426 of the administrative code of the city of New York is REPEALED and a new section 11-426 is added to read as follows:\n\t� 11-426 Defaults. a. An owner who has entered into a payment plan agreement with the department of finance or the department of environmental protection will be in default of such agreement if any installment required under such agreement remains unpaid for a period of 60 days from the date payment is required to be made. In the event of default of a payment plan agreement pursuant to this subdivision, the agreement may be canceled. Such a default may be cured upon payment, within 60 days from the date of default, of the unpaid payments, including all past due payments required by the agreement, and all other charges that became due during the term of the agreement that are past due and unpaid at the time of the default. If the default is not cured, all sums previously paid shall be returned to the owner.\n\tb. If a default is not cured as described in subdivision a of this section, the owner of the affected property will not be eligible to enter into a payment plan agreement with the department of finance or the department of environmental protection for the affected property for 3 years from the date of such default, unless the property owner can demonstrate that there were extenuating circumstances that prevented the property owner from curing the default.\n\t� 24. Section 11-427 of the administrative code of the city of New York is REPEALED and a new section 11-427 is added to read as follows:\n\t� 11-427 Tenant ownership of property. a. Tenants of a property that is subject to in rem foreclosure pursuant to this chapter shall be eligible to apply for eventual ownership of the subject property. At the time a property is selected for in rem foreclosure pursuant to section 11-401.2, the department of housing preservation and development shall provide written notice to the tenants of such property that the subject property is subject to an in rem judgment of foreclosure. Such notice shall include, but not be limited to: \n\t1. Information on the in rem foreclosure program; \n\t2. Information on how the tenants can apply for eventual ownership of the subject property; \n\t3. Information on tenants' rights during a foreclosure and transfer of ownership;\n\t4.
