The report would include information on the structural integrity of existing waterfront infrastructure, the suitability of City land for the development of new waterfront infrastructure, the feasibility of implementing urban agriculture or aquaculture alongside the City’s waterfront infrastructure, and the state of the City’s facilities supporting recreational access to its waterfront infrastructure.",
