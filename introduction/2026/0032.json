  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation (DOT) to give priority to senior-only housing developments operated by the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA), followed by non-senior only NYCHA developments when determining the order of repairs to be made at sidewalks in front of or abutting properties, when the DOT is required by law or has otherwise undertaken to make these repairs. This bill would also require DOT to report to the Council and post on the DOT website a report detailing which sidewalks have been repaired and a proposed timeline of sidewalk repairs for NYCHA developments.",

Such priority shall not apply where the commissioner determines that the sidewalk in front of or abutting property that is not operated by the New York city housing authority is in need of critical or emergency repairs, provided that the commissioner shall notify in writing the council member in whose district the housing development no longer receiving priority is located and the community board of the community district in which such development is located of the reasons for such determination. \n      c.
