  "Summary": "This bill would allow drivers to receive refunds for unused parking time purchased through parking application eWallets, and to transfer unused time from play-by-plate parking meters to another blockface with the same parking rate. Refunds or transfers would only be permitted if the unused time is worth more than the minimum purchase amount for the parking space, and the vehicle is not otherwise parked in violation of parking rules. The bill would also repeal the current ban on transferring unused parking time between blockfaces. Parking time purchased at pay-by-display parking meters, or parking application transactions not made through eWallets, would not be eligible for refunds or transfers.",
