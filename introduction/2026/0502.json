  "Summary": "This bill would require the Mayor, in 2026, to convene a quadrennial commission to review the compensation levels of the Mayor, Public Advocate, Comptroller, Borough Presidents, Council Members, and District Attorneys in New York City. The bill would also require a commission to be convened between January 1 and 15 of 2030 and every four years afterward. Each quadrennial commission would have sixty days from the day it is convened to make recommendations on new compensation levels for the City’s elected officials. Commissions would send their recommendations to both the Mayor and Council. The Mayor would, in the Mayor’s discretion, be able to send the Council approval, disapproval, or modifications to the commission’s recommendations. The Council would, in its discretion, review the recommendations and alter the compensation levels of the City’s elected officials.",
