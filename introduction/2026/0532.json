The commissioner of environmental protection, in collaboration with the fire commissioner, shall establish a pilot program to install drinking fountains on fire hydrants. As part of such program, the commissioners shall install drinking fountains on at least 5 fire hydrants per borough, and the drinking fountains shall be operational at least from April to September each year during the duration of the program. Such program shall commence no later than 2 years after the effective date of this local law and shall conclude 2 years after the commencement of such program.   \n      b. No later than 1 year after the conclusion of this program, the commissioner of environmental protection, in collaboration with the fire commissioner, shall submit to the mayor and speaker of the council a report that contains recommendations on whether to expand or make such program permanent. Such report shall also identify any challenges and issues presented by the program. \n      c. The commissioner of environmental protection and the fire commissioner need not comply with subdivisions a and b of this section if the fire commissioner determines that the drinking fountains would interfere with the fire department's use of fire hydrants. If the fire commissioner makes such a determination, the fire commissioner shall submit to the mayor and speaker of the council, within 6 months, a report identifying the specific reasons for such determination.  \n      � 2.
