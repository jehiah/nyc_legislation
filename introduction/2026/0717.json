  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Buildings (DOB) to notify property owners with open permits that the permits must receive DOB sign-off. This notification would also inform property owners of the consequences of failing to obtain sign-off. DOB would be required to email the notice to owners within seven days of a permit’s issuance and then every ninety days until sign-off is received, except that once the permit approaches expiration or expires, DOB would be required to email the notice every two weeks until sign-off is received.",
