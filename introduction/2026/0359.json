  "Summary": "This bill would require the Commissioner of Citywide Administrative Services, in coordination with the Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability, to identify city-owned lots suitable for installing energy storage systems, develop a plan to achieve the amount of energy storage capacity specified in the bill, and make annual progress reports. The bill would require that the energy storage capacity of energy storage systems on city-owned lots be at least 300 megawatts by the end of 2030 and at least 400 megawatts by the end of 2035. If that energy storage capacity is not achieved, the Commissioner of Citywide Administrative Services would be required to report on the reasons it was not achieved and to make recommendation on policies, programs, and actions to achieve the specified energy storage capacity.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Chapter 2 of title 4 of the administrative code is amended by adding a new section 4-207.5 to read as follows: \n      � 4.207.5 Energy storage on city-owned lots. a. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms have the following meanings: \n      Energy storage system. The term \"energy storage system\" means a set of methods and technologies for storing potential, kinetic, chemical, electromagnetic, thermal, or any other type of energy, including compressed air, flywheels, batteries, superconducting magnetic storage and ice storage, so that such energy may be used at a time other than when it is generated. \n      City-owned lot. The term \"city-owned lot\" means a parking lot owned by the city or an unused or underutilized parcel of land owned by the city.\n      Commissioner. The term \"commissioner\" means the commissioner of citywide administrative services. \n      Department. The term \"department\" means the department of citywide administrative services. \n      b. The commissioner, in coordination with the office of long-term planning and sustainability and any other agency authorized by the commissioner, shall identify all city-owned lots suitable for the installation of energy storage systems and develop a plan to achieve the energy storage capacity specified in subdivision d of this section. No later than 1 year after the effective date of the local law that added this section, the commissioner shall post such plan on the department's website and submit it to the speaker of the council. The plan shall include:\n      1. A list of each city-owned lot that has been identified as suitable for the installation of energy storage systems;\n      2. The energy storage potential of each such lot; and\n      3. A timeline for installation of energy storage systems on city-owned lots sufficient to achieve the energy storage capacity specified in subdivision d.\n      c. No later than 2 years after the effective date of the local law that added this section, and annually thereafter until 2035, the commissioner shall post in the department's website and submit the speaker of the council a report detailing the department's progress towards achieving the energy storage capacity specified in subdivision d of this section.\n      d. The commissioner, in coordination with the office of long-term planning and sustainability and any other agency authorized by the commissioner, shall install, or cause to be installed, energy storage systems on city-owned lots that in the aggregate have the energy storage capacity of:\n      1. No less than 300 megawatts by December 31, 2030; and \n      2. No less than 400 megawatts by December 31, 2035. \n      e. If the energy storage capacity of energy storage systems on city-owned lots is less than the energy storage capacity specified in subdivision d of this section, the commissioner shall submit to speaker of the council and post on the department's website a report that (i) explains the reasons for the failure to achieve the specified energy storage capacity and (ii) makes recommendations with respect to policies, programs, and actions that may be undertaken to achieve the specified energy storage capacity. If the energy storage capacity of energy storage systems on city-owned lots is less than specified in paragraph 1 of subdivision d of this section, the commissioner shall submit such report no later than June 30, 2031. If the energy storage capacity of energy storage systems on city-owned lots is less than specified in paragraph 2 of subdivision d of this section, the commissioner shall submit such report no later than June 30, 2036. \n      � 2.
