  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation (DOT) to establish curbside overnight parking areas in industrial business zones (IBZs) for the exclusive use of low and zero emission commercial vehicles. Prior to establishing such an overnight parking area, DOT would be required to provide notice to the community boards and council members representing the relevant IBZ, and would be required to discuss with those persons if requested to do so. This bill would also require DOT to conduct outreach to inform relevant stakeholders of these parking areas, as well as require annual reporting by DOT on such areas. This bill would expire on July 1, 2030.",
