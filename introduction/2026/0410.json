  "Summary": "This bill would require retail stores that primarily sell food for off-site consumption and retail stores that include a pharmacy to accept flexible benefits cards distributed by health insurance providers. This requirement would only apply to such retail stores that currently accept credit or debit cards. The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP”) would be required to provide outreach and education on this requirement. For any violation that occurs within one year of this requirement becoming law, DCWP would issue a warning. After one year, DCWP may issue a civil penalty of $250 for a first violation and $500 for any subsequent violation within 18 months of a previous violation.",
