  "Summary": "The charter requires prior approval by the Comptroller and Corporation Counsel of emergency procurements. This bill would limit the term of any emergency contract to 90 days, unless prior written approval is offered by the Comptroller and Corporation counsel for a longer period of time. Any written approval for an emergency contract of greater than 90 days requires a justification for why the longer term is necessary to avoid or mitigate a serious danger to life, safety, property, or a necessary service and why regular contracting procurement methods cannot avoid or mitigate those risks. The bill also requires emergency contracts to be submitted to the Comptroller for audit within 15 days of when the contract is executed, provided that failure to submit a contract within 15 days would not automatically void such contract.",
