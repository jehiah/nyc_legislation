  "Summary": "The charter requires prior approval by the Comptroller and Corporation Counsel of emergency procurements. This bill would limit the term of any emergency contract to 60 days, unless a prior approval is offered by the Comptroller and Corporation counsel for a longer period of time, provided that no such contract may have a term exceeding 270 days. Where the term of an emergency contract does exceed 60 days, the agency would be required to include an explanation of why such term is necessary to respond to an unforeseen danger to life, safety, property or a necessary service. The bill also requires emergency contracts to be submitted to the Comptroller for audit within 15 days of when the contract is executed, provided that failure to submit a contract within 15 days would not automatically void such contract.",
