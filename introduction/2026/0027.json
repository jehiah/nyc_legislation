  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to develop materials on the dangers of keeping a gun in the home and publish these materials online. The bill would also require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to develop an outreach program to give the materials to the facilities of healthcare providers not affiliated with the City for distribution at the facilities’ discretion, and to give the materials to the following entities: facilities operated by the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation for distribution to its patients at its discretion, the Department of Education for distribution to students, and the Office to End Domestic and Gender-Based Violence for distribution to individuals receiving services at Family Justice Centers. The bill would require an annual report by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene on the providing and distributing of the materials.",
