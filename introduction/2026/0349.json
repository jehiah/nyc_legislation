  "Summary": "A Community Land Trust (CLT) is a non-profit, community-run organization that can acquire and develop land with the goal of promoting permanent affordable housing and stabilizing housing markets. This bill would define CLTs that are established in the City to be entities that cover more uses beneficial to the local community beyond housing, such as manufacturing and commercial uses, as well as the development of open space and community gardening.",
