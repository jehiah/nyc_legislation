Such new low income housing shall be within the building in which the unlawful eviction occurred, in a new building at the same site as the building in which the unlawful eviction occurred, or in a building within the same community district, in accordance with rules promulgated by the department, provided that such owner shall construct or provide no less than the greater of: (i) 25 percent of the total residential floor area of such  building  in which the unlawful eviction occurred, or (ii) 20 percent of the total floor area of any separate building.
