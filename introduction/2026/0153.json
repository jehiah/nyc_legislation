  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation (DOT) to assess at least 100 speed camera locations per year to determine the feasibility of installing a raised speed reducer. At any location where a raised speed reducer is deemed feasible, DOT would be required to install a raised speed reducer within one year. DOT would also be required to report annually on the required assessments, assess changes in dangerous driving indicators at speed camera locations where raised speed reducers are installed and provide recommendations as to whether speed cameras remain necessary at those locations.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n      Section 1. Subchapter 3 of chapter 1 of title 19 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 19-189.2 to read as follows:\n      � 19-189.2 Raised speed reducer feasibility assessment. a. Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings:\n      Raised speed reducer. The term \"raised speed reducer\" means a raised area of roadway that deflects the wheels and frame of a traversing vehicle with the purpose of reducing vehicle speeds, including, but not limited to, speed humps, speed cushions and raised crosswalks.\n      Speed camera. The term \"speed camera\" means a photo violation-monitoring system installed for the purposes of issuing violations pursuant to section 1180-b of the vehicle and traffic law.\n      b. On an annual basis, the department shall assess at least 100 existing speed camera locations to determine whether it is feasible to install a raised speed reducer at the location. If the installation of a raised speed reducer is feasible, the department shall, within one year of the determination, install a raised speed reducer within 125 feet of the speed camera.\n      c. For the purposes of the assessment required by subdivision b of this section, the department may determine that the installation of a raised speed reducer is not feasible if, in the judgement of the department, the installation would endanger the safety of any road user or would be otherwise inconsistent with department guidelines for the installation of a raised speed reducer, provided that the presence of a speed camera may not be a criteria used to determine raised speed reducer feasibility. \n      d. No later than December 31 of each year, the department shall submit to the mayor and the speaker of the council and post on its website a report regarding each speed camera location assessed pursuant to subdivision b of this section, and each speed camera location that includes one or more raised speed reducers. The report must include a list of locations assessed pursuant to subdivision b of this section, and for any location where a raised speed reducer was deemed infeasible, an explanation of the reasons for the determination. For any speed camera location that also includes a raised speed reducer, the report must also provide an assessment of changes in speed data, crash history, roadway geometry and speed camera violations issued compared with the same data collected during the year prior to the installation of the raised speed reducer, and a recommendation regarding whether the speed camera at each location remains necessary for the purpose of ensuring street safety and compliance with posted maximum speed limits. \n      � 2.
