  "Summary": "Under current city law property owners or their agents are required to disclose whether they will obtain a tenant screening report that may report on a prospective tenant’s credit, criminal record, history in housing court, or other factors. If the applicant is denied, the landlord or agent must disclose that the denial was based on such a report and instruct the applicant on how to obtain a copy of the report. This bill would require the landlord or agent to also provide applicants with the criteria they use to reject applicants based on the tenant screening reports.",

Section 20-807 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new subdivision e to read as follows:\n      e. Tenant-screening criteria. The term \"tenant-screening criteria\" means the complete list of subjective and objective factors an owner, lessor, lessee, sublessee, assignee, or managing agent of, or other person having the right to sell, rent or lease or approve the sale, rental or lease of a housing accommodation, constructed or to be constructed, or an interest therein, or any agent or employee thereof, or real estate broker, will consider when evaluating prospective tenants for the applied-for housing accommodation.\n\t� 2. Section 20-808 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 2 for the year 2010, is amended to read as follows:\n      � 20-808 Disclosure. a.

The written tenant-screening criteria shall specify all objective and subjective criteria that will be used to review rental applications, which may include the specific financial, criminal, rental history, and any other criteria used in deciding whether to rent or lease to a prospective tenant or tenants; and\n      (iv) in the case of a denial of an application submitted by a prospective tenant or tenants, within three (3) business days of the denial, a written or electronic document setting forth a plain statement of all reasons for the denial of the application. Such statement shall identify which tenant-screening criteria were used or considered as a basis for denial.\n      b. If application information is requested in writing, the statements required by paragraphs (i), (ii), and (iii) of subdivision a of this section shall be in writing, located immediately adjacent to where personal information is requested, and set off in a box and printed in a color that sharply contrasts with the print surrounding it.
