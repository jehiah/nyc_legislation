  "Summary": "This bill would create an enforcement scheme for repeat violators of the City’s Human Rights Law (HRL). Under the scheme, repeat violators must carry out a remedial anti-discrimination plan, subject to supervision by the City Commission for Human Rights (CCHR), for a period of 1 to 5 years. The supervision period may be extended for noncompliance with the plan or for additional violations of the HRL. CCHR must consider imposing a supervised remedial plan any time a covered entity violates the HRL three times in a two-year span. This bill would also require CCHR to conduct a public information campaign on best practices for places of public accommodation, including educational institutions, to comply with the HRL.",

The supervisory period required by subparagraph (c) of paragraph 1 of this subdivision shall be extended for an additional period of not less than 1 year and not more than 3 years from the date on which the commission, as applicable:\n     (a) Determines that, during such supervisory period, the respondent has materially deviated from the terms of the remedial plan on more than 2 occasions; or \n     (b) Finds, pursuant to requisite proceedings under subdivision a of this section, that during such supervisory period the respondent engaged in any unlawful discriminatory practice or any act of discriminatory harassment or violence as set forth in chapter 6 of this title.\n     c.
