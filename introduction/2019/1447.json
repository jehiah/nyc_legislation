Such term shall not include data stored solely on an agency-owned personal computing device, or data stored solely on a portion of a network that has been exclusively assigned to a single agency employee or a single agency owned or controlled computing device and that is not otherwise shared with or utilized by other agency employees. Such term shall not include data collected in a physical format by a single agency employee meant for the sole use of such employee;\n      Director. The term \"director\" means the director of the office of data analytics.\n      b.
