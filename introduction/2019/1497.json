  "Summary": "This bill would prohibit leaving companion animals unattended outdoors during inclement weather conditions. Leaving an animal outdoors in these conditions could have harmful and even deadly consequences for the animal due to such issues as overheating, freezing, and other exposure-related health issues. Penalizing this practice and subjecting violators to the registration requirements of the Animal Abuse Registry could be an effective way to deter this practice and potentially save animals’ lives.",
