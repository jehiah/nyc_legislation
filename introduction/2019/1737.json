  "Summary": "This bill would amend various aspects of the process for issuing an after hours variance (AHV). It would provide that an AHV issued for public safety purposes expire 15 days after issuance, that an AHV only be issued for the hours of 6 a.m. to 7 a.m. and 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. on weekdays and for the hours of 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekends, limit the number of days than an applicant for AHVs can request it to 3 weekdays per week, one Saturday or one Sunday per week and not include any holiday on which alternate side of the street parking rules are suspended, require the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to issue a written explanation for its decisions on whether to issue an AHV and require an annual report where DEP would report to the Council data on the administration of the AHV process.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Subdivision (e) of section 24-223 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 113 for the year 2005, is amended to read as follows:\n      (e) Authorization for after hours construction work may only be issued in the following circumstances:\n      (1) Emergency work. Agencies shall authorize such after hours construction work for emergency conditions, inside or outside the property line, involving a threat to public safety or causing or likely to cause the imminent interruption of service required by law, contract or franchise. An emergency authorization issued pursuant to this paragraph shall expire as determined by the agency but no later than the [ninetieth] fifteenth day after its issuance and shall be renewable in accordance with agency procedures while the emergency continues.\n      (2) Public safety. Agencies may authorize such after hours work, inside or outside of the property line, where the agency determines that the work cannot reasonably or practicably be performed on weekdays between the hours of 7 a.m. and 6 p.m. because of traffic congestion and/or concern for worker and/or public safety. An authorization issued pursuant to this paragraph shall [expire, as determined by the agency, but] expire after a number of days that the commissioner of environmental protection shall, in consultation with the commissioner of buildings, establish by rule for the type of work involved, provided that such authorization shall expire no later than the [ninetieth] fifteenth day after its issuance and shall be renewable in accordance with [agency procedures] subdivision (f) of this section.\n      (3) [City] Government construction projects.

Agencies may authorize the performance of such construction activities after hours in accordance with such rules.\n      (5) Undue hardship.

Applications for such certification shall be submitted to the department in a form and manner to be set forth in the rules of the department. The applicant for an after hours authorization under this paragraph shall submit such certification to the issuing agency.\n      � 2.

The commissioner shall also provide an explanation of such denial or amendment to such applicant.\n      (B) Where such applicant submits a request for an authorization for after hours construction and the commissioner has issued an authorization to a prior applicant for after hours construction to occur on the same or adjacent block on a date to occur after such submission, the commissioner may only issue the authorization for after hours construction to such present applicant for after hours construction to occur on the same date as the previously issued authorization that was granted to the prior applicant. Such applicant may appeal such decision in writing within 10 days that such decision was issued by the commissioner.\n      (4) No later than December 1, 2020 and by December 1 every year thereafter, the department shall submit a report to the mayor and the council on the issuance of  authorizations for after hours construction. Such report shall, for the immediately preceding fiscal year include, but not be limited to: \n      (A) The total number of applications for authorizations for after hours construction disaggregated by borough and community district and the  number of authorizations for after hours construction issued by the department;\n      (B) The location for each project for which an authorization for after hours construction was issued by the department;\n      (C) The permitted length of time for each authorization for after hours construction that was issued by the department;\n       (D) A description of any violation of the terms of an authorization for after hours construction by an applicant, the identifying information of such applicant and the penalties, if any, issued to such applicant; and \n      (E) The number of complaints, received for each project for which an authorization for after hours construction was issued by the department, received through the 311 citizen service center or other means. \n      � 3.

In addition, the department shall post such information on its website on a weekly basis. \n      \n      � 4.
