  "Summary": "This bill would require an animal shelter, directed by a sheriff or city marshal executing a warrant of eviction or any order or judgment granting legal possession, to retrieve a companion animal from such premises as expeditiously as possible after receiving such direction. The legislation also provides a cause of action to any person claiming to be denied possession of their companion animal by a landlord still in possession of such companion animal, and grants them the following possible relief against the landlord: compensatory and punitive damages; injunctive and declaratory relief; an order of seizure; and attorney’s fees and costs.",
