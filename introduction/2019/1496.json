  "Summary": "This bill would require an animal shelter, directed by a sheriff or city marshal executing a warrant of eviction or any order or judgment granting legal possession, to retrieve a companion animal from such premises as expeditiously as possible after receiving such direction. The legislation also provides a cause of action to any person claiming to be denied possession of their companion animal by a landlord still in possession of such companion animal, and grants them the following possible relief against the landlord: compensatory and punitive damages; injunctive and declaratory relief; an order of seizure; and attorney’s fees and costs.",

Chapter 8 of title 17 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding new sections 17-818 and 17-819 to read as follows:\n      � 17-818 Animals discovered during eviction or action taken pursuant to any order or judgment granting legal possession. An animal shelter directed by a sheriff or city marshal executing a warrant of eviction or any order or judgment granting legal possession to retrieve a companion animal from such premises shall retrieve such companion animal as expeditiously as possible after receiving such direction.\n      � 17-819 Civil cause of action for persons denied possession of companion animals. \n      a. Except as provided in this section or as otherwise provided by law, any person claiming to be denied possession of their companion animal by a landlord still in possession of such companion animal after the execution of a warrant of eviction or action taken pursuant to any order or judgment granting legal possession shall have a cause of action against such landlord in any court of competent jurisdiction for any or all of the following relief:\n1. Compensatory and punitive damages;\n      2. Injunctive and declaratory relief;\n      3. An order of seizure pursuant to article 71 of the civil practice law and rules;\n      4.

No person shall be liable under this section if a companion animal is received by its owner or by an animal shelter, animal rescue group or any animal care and control organization approved or designated by or acting on behalf of the department within three days of the warrant of eviction or action taken pursuant to any order or judgment granting legal possession.\n      c. Nothing in this section shall be construed to create a cause of action against:\n      1.
