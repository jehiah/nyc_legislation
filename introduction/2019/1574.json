  "Summary": "This bill would mandate the establishment of commercial waste zones. The Department of Sanitation would designate commercial waste zones and enter into agreements with private carters to operate in the zones.",
  "TextID": 67647,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      Section 1. Legislative purpose. The Council hereby finds that the current system for collecting commercial waste from the City's businesses is plagued by dangerous driving and insufficient attention to public safety, harmful environmental impacts, and poor customer service. Since 2010, private waste collection trucks have killed dozens of people on New York City streets. Long, inefficient routes can take 12 hours or more to finish and can lead to driver fatigue and unsafe practices, endangering workers and the public. \n      The Council further finds that private carters often have customers throughout the five boroughs, currently resulting in millions of excess truck miles driven every year that harm the City's air quality, increase greenhouse gas emissions, and negatively impact public health. The current system also creates noise pollution within the City's neighborhoods, as dozens of private waste collection trucks may visit a single block in the course of one night. The industry lacks strong customer service standards, and pricing remains opaque to most customers, putting small businesses at a significant disadvantage.  \n      The Council finds that substantial reform of the commercial waste industry is necessary to protect public health and safety, and to improve the industry for the benefit of its customers. According to data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, refuse and recycling collectors have one of the top five most dangerous jobs in the United States, and the Council finds that the safety risks inherent to private carting are exacerbated in New York City, where vehicles must navigate narrow, highly congested streets in variable traffic and weather conditions. The Council finds that a commercial waste zone system, where the City selects private carters through a competitive process, will result in a carting industry where carters are required to operate more responsibly and adequately train workers on the unique challenges of collecting commercial waste in New York City, leading to safer practices and safer streets. \n      The Council further finds that establishing a commercial waste zone collection system within the City would dramatically reduce truck traffic associated with this industry - by 50 percent, eliminating more than 18 million miles of truck traffic from New York City streets every year. With fewer miles traveled and fewer trucks on the streets, a zoned collection system will reduce incentives for unsafe working conditions, reduce the risks of unsafe driving behavior and worker fatigue, and make the City safer for all New Yorkers.\n      The Council further finds that the reduction in traffic resulting from a regulated zoned collection system would lead to commensurate reductions of air pollutant emissions, including greenhouse gases, particulate matter and other air pollutants, and would lead to less nighttime noise, less roadway wear and tear, and improved quality of life in neighborhoods across New York City. The Council further finds that reducing the number of private carters operating within each of the City's neighborhoods and selecting carters through a competitive solicitation process will allow the City to ensure that private carters collect waste more efficiently, offer high quality waste collection services, and advance the City's efforts to reduce waste disposal and increase recycling. \n\tThe Council therefore finds and declares that commercial waste reform in New York City is necessary to promote the public health, safety and welfare of all New Yorkers. Therefore, the Council intends to authorize the commissioner of sanitation to establish commercial waste collection zones by dividing the City's geographic area into several zones and authorizing a small number of private carters to serve businesses within each zone through a competitive solicitation process. The application of this local law will create a safe and efficient collection system that provides high quality service, and reduces the harmful environmental impacts of the trade waste industry in New York City. \n      � 2. Section 753 of the New York city charter is amended by adding a new subdivision e to read as follows:\n      e. Except as otherwise authorized by section 16-1020 of the administrative code, the commissioner shall have the powers and duties set forth in this subdivision.\n      1.

Legislative purpose. The Council hereby finds that the current system for collecting commercial waste from the City\\rquote s businesses is plagued by dangerous driving and insufficient attention to public safety, harmful environmental impacts, and poor customer service. Since 2010, private waste collection trucks have killed dozens of people on New York City streets. Long, inefficient routes can take 12 hours or more to finish and can lead to driver fatigue and unsafe practices, endangering workers and the public. \\par\nThe Council further finds that private carters often have customers throughout the five boroughs, currently resulting in millions of excess truck miles driven every year that harm the City\\rquote s air quality, increase greenhouse gas emissions, and negatively impact public health. The current system also creates noise pollution within the City\\rquote s neighborhoods, as dozens of private waste collection trucks may visit a single block in the course of one night. The industry lacks strong customer service standards, and pricing remains opaque to most customers, putting small businesses at a significant disadvantage.  \\par\nThe Council finds that substantial reform of the commercial waste industry is necessary to protect public health and safety, and to improve the industry for the benefit of its customers. According to data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, refuse and recycling collectors have one of the top five most dangerous jobs in the United States, and the Council finds that the safety risks inherent to private carting are exacerbated in New York City, where vehicles must navigate narrow, highly congested streets in variable traffic and weather conditions. The Council finds that a commercial waste zone system, where the City selects private carters through a competitive process, will result in a carting industry where carters are required to operate more responsibly and adequately train workers on the unique challenges of collecting commercial waste in New York City, leading to safer practices and safer streets. \\par\nThe Council further finds that establishing a commercial waste zone collection system within the City would dramatically reduce truck traffic associated with this industry - by 50 percent, eliminating more than 18 million miles of truck traffic from New York City streets every year. With fewer miles traveled and fewer trucks on the streets, a zoned collection system will reduce incentives for unsafe working conditions, reduce the risks of unsafe driving behavior and worker fatigue, and make the City safer for all New Yorkers.\\par\nThe Council further finds that the reduction in traffic resulting from a regulated zoned collection system would lead to commensurate reductions of air pollutant emissions, including greenhouse gases, particulate matter and other air pollutants, and would lead to less nighttime noise, less roadway wear and tear, and improved quality of life in neighborhoods across New York City. The Council further finds that reducing the number of private carters operating within each of the City\\rquote s neighborhoods and selecting carters through a competitive solicitation process will allow the City to ensure that private carters collect waste more efficiently, offer high quality waste collection services, and advance the City\\rquote s efforts to reduce waste disposal and increase recycling. \\par\n\\pard\\ltrpar\\hyphpar0\\sl480\\slmult1\\qj\\tab The Council therefore finds and declares that commercial waste reform in New York City is necessary to promote the public health, safety and welfare of all New Yorkers. Therefore, the Council intends to authorize the commissioner of sanitation to establish commercial waste collection zones by dividing the City\\rquote s geographic area into several zones and authorizing a small number of private carters to serve businesses within each zone through a competitive solicitation process. The application of this local law will create a safe and efficient collection system that provides high quality service, and reduces the harmful environmental impacts of the trade waste industry in New York City. \\par\n\\pard\\ltrpar\\hyphpar0\\fi720\\sl480\\slmult1\\qj\\'a7 2.
