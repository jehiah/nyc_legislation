  "Summary": "Applications to the Board of Standards and Appeals are often very lengthy, and copies of these applications must be sent to at least five separate entities. In order to reduce the cost and waste of this process, this bill would require the Board of Standards and Appeals to approve a method of electronically delivering these required copies and to determine what would constitute adequate proof of service.",
