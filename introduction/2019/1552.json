  "Summary": "This bill would mandate the establishment of district diversity working groups in each community school district. These working groups would work to facilitate the creation and publishing of public-input integration plans in every school district. The working groups would be made up of students, parents, teachers, principals, administrators, and community advocates. Issues that would be addressed include but are not limited to: admission policies, transfer trends, language access and transportation.
