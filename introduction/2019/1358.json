  "Summary": "This bill would require the Administration for Children’s Services (ACS) to report data on a quarterly and annual basis from its contracted foster care provider agencies about the use of psychiatric medication by children in its legal custody, and possible prescribing trends. The report would include information on how many youths are prescribed a psychiatric medication or medications, disaggregated by various categories of medication such as anti-depressant, anti-psychotic, anxiolytic or hypnotic medication, long-acting anti-psychotic medication, medication to treat opioid use disorder and mood stabilizers. ACS would be required to review the reports and submit a description of actions it took to promote best practices for use of psychiatric medication for youth in foster care.",
