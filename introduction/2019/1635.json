  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Cultural Affairs (DCLA) to establish a program to solicit works of art from the public for display on temporary protective structures at construction sites. DCLA, in consultation with the Department of Buildings (DOB), would be required to biennially approve at least 40 such works of art, as well as 10 received through solicitation by other offices or agencies. This bill would require owners of properties where a temporary protective structure is installed to display artwork, selected either from among the 40 approved works, or by seeking site-specific artwork, on such temporary protective structure. This bill establishes an opt out for certain  property owners who elect not to participate in this program.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Chapter 67 of the New York city charter is amended by adding a new section 2508 to read as follows:\n      � 2508. City canvas program. a.

Any such works of art approved pursuant to this section must be consistent with the Zoning Resolution and comply with the rules of the department. The department, in consultation with the department of buildings, shall, to the extent received, biennially approve at least 40 such works of art for such display.  The not-for-profit organization that proposed a work of art for display shall secure the prior consent of the owner of the protective structure to display such proposed work. \n      b. The department shall annually disseminate information about the program established by this chapter, including language soliciting submissions of works of art for display on temporary protective structures, to city agencies and entities, including the following, which may share such information with members of the public served by such agencies or entities:\n      1. the city university of New York;\n      2. the commission on human rights;\n      3. the department for the aging;\n      4. the department of consumer and worker protection;\n      5. the department of correction;\n      6. the department of education;\n      7. the department of health and mental hygiene;\n      8. the department of homeless services;\n      9. the department of veterans' services;\n      10. the department of youth and community development;\n      11. the New York city health and hospitals corporation;\n      12. the New York public library;\n      13. the Brooklyn public library;\n      14. the Queens public library; and\n      15. residents of the New York city housing authority\n      From among the works of art received in response to such solicitation, the department, in consultation with the department of buildings, shall biennially approve no less than 10 such works of art for such display purposes. \n      c. No later than September 1, 2025, and annually thereafter, the commissioner shall post information about works of art approved pursuant to subdivision a, subdivision b, and section 3307.11.2.1 of the New York city building code on the department's website.

Such website shall also include information about artists available to participate in the program, as well as information for property owners seeking to commission artwork pursuant to section 3307.11.2.1 of the New York city building code.\n      � 2. Section 3307 of the New York city building code is amended by adding a new section 3307.11 to read as follows:\n3307.11 Artwork on temporary protective structures.  To the extent permissible under the zoning resolution, approved artwork or alternative artwork, as selected by the owner of a property at which a temporary protective structure has been installed, shall be displayed on such temporary protective structure as provided in this section.\n\n3307.11.1 Temporary protective structure types.

The owner of a property where a temporary protective structure has been installed may solicit a work or works of art for display on such temporary protective structures in lieu of approved artwork. Such owner shall notify, at a minimum, the council member in whose district such property is located and the community board of the community district in which such property is located, of a request for a work of art to be displayed on temporary protective structures at such property. Such owner may additionally notify community-based organizations based in the community district in which such property is located and any school, as such term is defined in subdivision g of section 522 of the New York city charter, located in the community district in which such property is located, of a request for works of art to be displayed on temporary protective structures at such property. Notifications made pursuant to this section must be made timely in accordance with a schedule established by rules of the department.  Prior to installation of such work of art, such owner must obtain the approval for such work of art from the department of cultural affairs. \n\n\n3307.11.3 Illumination prohibited.
