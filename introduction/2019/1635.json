  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Cultural Affairs (DCLA) to establish a program to solicit works of art from the public for display on temporary protective structures at construction sites. DCLA, in consultation with the Department of Buildings (DOB), would be required to biennially approve at least 40 such works of art, as well as 10 received through solicitation by other offices or agencies. This bill would require owners of properties where a temporary protective structure is installed to display artwork, selected either from among the 40 approved works, or by seeking site-specific artwork, on such temporary protective structure. This bill establishes an opt out for certain  property owners who elect not to participate in this program.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Chapter 67 of the New York city charter is amended by adding a new section 2508 to read as follows:\n      � 2508. City canvas program. a. The department shall implement a program to approve, subject to appropriations, from qualified not-for-profit organizations, including borough arts councils, the submission of works of art for display on temporary protective structures. Any such works of art approved pursuant to this section must be consistent with the Zoning Resolution and comply with the rules of the department. The department, in consultation with the department of buildings, shall, to the extent received, biennially approve at least 40 such works of art for such display.  The not-for-profit organization that proposed a work of art for display shall secure the prior consent of the owner of the protective structure to display such proposed work. \n      b.
