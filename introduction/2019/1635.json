  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Cultural Affairs (DCLA) to establish a program to solicit works of art from the public for display on temporary protective structures at construction sites. DCLA, in consultation with the Department of Buildings (DOB), would be required to biennially approve at least 40 such works of art, as well as 10 received through solicitation by other offices or agencies. This bill would require owners of properties where a temporary protective structure is installed to display artwork, selected either from among the 40 approved works, or by seeking site-specific artwork, on such temporary protective structure. This bill establishes an opt out for certain  property owners who elect not to participate in this program.",
