  "Summary": "This bill would require the Economic Development Corporation to report on the New York Works program every year until 2027. The report would include the specific goals of the program at its inception, the total number of jobs the New York Works program anticipates creating at the end of the reporting period, the number of jobs created since the inception of the program, and the number of individuals who obtained employment since the inception of the program. The information about recently employed individuals would be disaggregated by level of educational attainment, race and ethnicity, gender, whether the individuals are residents of New York City and salary. The information about newly created jobs would also be disaggregated by borough, company and, if the company has contracted with the city to create jobs, the number of jobs per contract.",
