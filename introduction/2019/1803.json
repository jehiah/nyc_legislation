These conditions include (1) requiring building owners provide tenants of the vacated buildings with either temporary dwellings or assistance in relocating to temporary dwellings; (2) requiring that building owners notify building tenants that they have a right to reoccupy the buildings once the buildings may be legally reoccupied; and (3) requiring that building owners notify building tenants that the building owners will permit the tenants to reoccupy the building. This bill further requires building owners to notify both the building tenants and HPD when buildings are ready for reoccupancy. Finally, this bill penalizes building owners who permit tenants to move into buildings with vacate orders before the buildings may legally be reoccupied.","TextID":67733,"Text":"Int.
