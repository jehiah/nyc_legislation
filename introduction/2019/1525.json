  "Summary": "This bill would require the 311 customer service center to conduct at least five annual customer satisfaction surveys. The bill would require each customer satisfaction survey conducted in relation to 311 user experience to be offered, in addition to English, in ten designated citywide languages, as determined based on United States census data and New York City Department of Education data. The bill would require the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications to submit an annual report containing the results of any such survey, disaggregated by the language in which the survey was conducted.",
