This bill would require city agencies to provide information regarding every automated decision system used by the agency during the prior calendar year to the Mayor’s Office of Operations. Such information would include what each automated decision system is intended to measure or reveal and a description of the decisions made or based on such system. The Mayor’s Office of Operations would be required to compile the information received by city agencies and report it to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council every year.","TextID":67780,"Text":"Int.
