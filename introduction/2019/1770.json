Certain whistleblowers who report misconduct to the Special Commissioner of Investigation for the New York City School District would be protected against adverse personnel actions. The Special Commissioner of Investigation would be required to investigate whistleblower allegations of adverse personnel action that fall within the official’s jurisdiction, and the Corporation Counsel would be required to investigate adverse personnel actions allegedly committed by the Special Commissioner of Investigation and high-ranking officials within the Department of Investigation. Also, the investigating officer would be required to provide periodic status updates regarding the investigation to the relevant whistleblower. Furthermore, if the relevant agency or entity head fails to take remedial action recommended by or acceptable to the investigating officer within a certain time period, the agency or entity would have to provide a written explanation regarding this failure to the relevant whistleblower and the investigating officer.  This bill would also establish a private right of action for a relevant whistleblower who suffers adverse personnel action if the whistleblower’s employer does not take remedial actions recommended by or acceptable to the investigating officer. Finally, this bill would require more comprehensive annual reporting by the Commissioner of Investigation regarding reports by whistleblowers on misconduct and adverse personnel actions.","TextID":69502,"Text":"Int.
