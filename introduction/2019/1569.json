  "Summary": "This bill would limit the requirements on smaller for-hire vehicle bases for dispatching for-hire vehicle trips to accessible vehicles recently set by the Taxi and Limousine Commission by limiting the percentage of total trips required to be dispatched to and completed by accessible vehicles. The required percentages would increase each year until July 1, 2022, at which point the required percentage of 15 percent would come into effect and would apply thereafter.",
