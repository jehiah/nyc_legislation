  "Summary": "This bill would require the New York Police Department (NYPD) to post on its website and file on a monthly basis with the Mayor and the Speaker of the City Council, a report regarding response times to minor or non-critical vehicular crashes, the amount of time between the 911 call, dispatch, and response, whether pedestrians were involved and whether any injuries were sustained. The reported information would be disaggregated by precinct, borough and zip code. The NYPD would also be required to submit to the Mayor and the Speaker of the City Council recommendations on how to reduce response times to such crashes.",
