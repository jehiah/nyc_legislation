  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to report twice a year on the rate of diabetes-related health problems in New York City. The information in such reports will be disaggregated by geographic area and demographic characteristics, where such data is available and while maintaining confidentiality on the individuals included in such data. The bill would also require DOHMH to compile a comprehensive report by December 1, 2021, and submit recommendations and a plan to reduce the occurrence of diabetes-related health problems and to implement the department’s recommendations.",
