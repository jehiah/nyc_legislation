  "Summary": "This bill would amend the building code to require that sidewalk sheds installed after June 1, 2019 comply with new design requirements.  Specifically, it would require new design elements for sidewalk sheds including (1) the use of light-transmitting plastic material to construct the sidewalk shed; (2) the elimination of braces below a height of 8 feet above the sidewalk; (3) the use of adjustable feet that pivot as part of the vertical beams supporting the sidewalk shed; and (4) the installation of LED lights to fulfill the lighting requirements of sidewalk sheds. The new criteria would not apply to sidewalk sheds that are installed before June 1, 2019 but would affect sidewalk sheds for which renewal permits are sought after such date.",

  "Text": "Int. No. 1501\n\nBy Council Member Cornegy\n\n..Title\nA Local Law to amend the New York city building code, in relation to requiring that sidewalk sheds are constructed using an alternative to cross-braced scaffolds to provide greater sidewalk access and safety\n..Body\n\nBe it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Section 3307.6.4.2.2 of the New York city building code, is amended by adding a new item 3 to read as follows:\n3307.6.4.2.2 Storage. Storage on sidewalk sheds shall be as follows:\n\n1.   No item shall be stored or placed upon a sidewalk shed designed as a light duty sidewalk shed under Section 3307.6.4.2.\n\n2.   No material shall be stored or placed upon a sidewalk shed designed as a heavy duty sidewalk shed under Section 3307.6.4.2 unless the shed is designed for such storage, with such areas of storage or placement clearly designated on the drawings. Where an item is to be stored or placed upon a heavy duty sidewalk shed, and such storage or placement is not in excess of 150 pounds per square foot (732.3 kg/m2) on any square foot area of the sidewalk shed, the design live load of 300 pounds per square foot (1464.6 kg/m) need not be increased. Where an item is to be stored or placed upon a heavy duty sidewalk shed, and such storage or placement is in excess of 150 pounds per square foot (732.3 kg/m2) on any square foot area of the sidewalk shed, such shed shall be designed to carry:\n\n2.1   The live load of 300 pounds per square foot (1464.6 kg/m) required of a heavy duty sidewalk shed; and\n2.2   The load of the item to be placed or stored upon the shed, minus 150 pounds per square foot (732.3 kg/m2).\n\n3. The structure shall be capable of sustaining a horizontal live load equal to 2% of its vertical live load.\n\n      � 2. Section 3307.6.4.3 of the New York city building code, as added by local law number 141 for the year 2013, is amended to read as follows:\n3307.6.4.3 Materials. Sidewalk sheds shall be constructed out of wood, steel, or other material possessing equivalent strength and suitability. Any sidewalk shed installed after June 1, 2019, shall be constructed out of light-transmitting plastic material which shall include an anti-slip walking surface integral to the material or as an applied coating.\n\n      � 3. Section 3307.6.4.4 of the New York city building code, is amended by adding new items 6 and 7 to read as follows:\n3307.6.4.4 Vertical members and beams. Vertical members and beams of the sidewalk shed shall conform with the following:\n\n1.   Vertical members and beams shall be adequately braced and connected to prevent displacement or distortion of the framework.\n\n2.   The vertical members of the sidewalk shed shall be plumb, with a tolerance of L/100, with \"L\" measured as the distance from the ground to the first X-brace or bottom of the beam.\n\n3.   Vertical members shall not be placed into the street unless approved by the Department of Transportation and protected in accordance with Department of Transportation requirements.\n\n4.   Vertical members placed on the sidewalk shall not be placed closer than 18 inches from the face of the curbline.\n\n5.   Vertical members shall be placed at least 7 feet (2134 mm) from the edge of a curb cut or vehicular access point, or where placed closer, the vertical members nearest the curb cut or vehicular access point shall be protected against displacement by vehicles, or shall be identified with high visibility marking.\n\n6. Any sidewalk shed installed after June 1, 2019, shall not include any bracing or struts placed below a height of 8 feet above the sidewalk.\n\n7. Any vertical beams installed as part of a sidewalk shed after June 1, 2019, shall have adjustable feet that pivot and extend to accommodate changes in sidewalk pitch.\n\n      � 4. Section 3307.6.4.5 of the New York city building code, as added by local law number 141 for the year 2013, is amended to read as follows:\n3307.6.4.5 Deck. The deck of the sidewalk shed shall consist of 2-inch (51 mm) thick wood plank or equivalent material and shall be capable of sustaining the loads required by Section 3307.6.4.2. The deck shall be solid, or shall consist of planking laid close and made tight. Where the edge of the sidewalk shed abuts a building or structure, the decking shall be brought tight to the face of the building or structure.\n\n[Exception]Exceptions: \n1. Where it is not possible to bring the deck tightly against the face of the building or structure, the deck shall be brought to within 1 inch (25 mm) of the face of the building or structure, with the resulting gap sealed or covered by material of sufficient manner and strength capable of trapping falling debris. \n\n2. A sidewalk shed deck installed after June 1, 2019 shall be constructed of light-transmitting plastic material and shall be designed to meet the performance requirements of section BC 3307.6.\n\n      � 5.

Temporary removal of a portion of the parapet is permitted for the handling of material, provided the parapet is immediately restored at the end of the handling operation.\n\nExceptions:\n1.   A parapet is not required along the edge of the sidewalk shed that abuts a building or structure.\n\n2.   A parapet is not required along the edge of a sidewalk shed that abuts an area that is closed to the public.\n\n3.   In lieu of a vertical parapet, angled protection of identical construction to a parapet that inclines outward at an angle of 45 degrees (0.79 rad) may be utilized provided such protection is securely attached to the deck, and provided the angled protection extends to a point that intersects a line drawn 3 feet 6 inches (1067 mm) above the level of the deck.\n\n4. A sidewalk shed parapet installed after June 1, 2019, shall be constructed of light-transmitting plastic material and shall be designed to meet the performance requirements of section BC 3307.6.\n\n      � 6. Section 3307.6.4.8 of the New York city building code, is amended by adding a new item 4 to read as follows:\n3307.6.4.8 Lighting.
