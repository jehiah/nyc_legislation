  "Summary": "Side guards are vehicle-based safety devices that prevent pedestrians, cyclists, and others from being caught in the otherwise exposed space between the front and rear axles of large vehicles.  This bill would accelerate existing deadlines for side guard implementation in the City fleet and for trade waste hauling vehicles from January 1, 2024 to January 1, 2023. The bill would also require that side guards are equipped on any large vehicle used to fulfill a contract with the City of at least $2 million, starting with contracts registered on or after January 1, 2023.",
