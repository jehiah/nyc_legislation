  "Summary": "This bill would prohibit food service establishments that serve beverages in single-use containers from refusing the request of a customer who asks for a beverage to be served in a reusable beverage container provided by the customer instead of the establishment’s single-use container, provided that the beverage container is capable and appropriate for serving such beverage. In addition, this bill would require such food service establishments to have signs informing customers that they may request service of beverages in their own reusable containers.",
