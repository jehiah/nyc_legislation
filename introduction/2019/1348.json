  "Summary": "This bill would amend the required Department of Education (DOE) annual reporting on the amount of health education, including HIV/AIDS education and sexual health education, received by students in each grade at each school. The bill would expand reporting to include the number of certified health education instructors at each school, disaggregated by full-time and part-time licensed instructors, and the number of instructors that teach on an incidental basis. Per state law, incidental teaching occurs when a teacher is assigned to teach a subject outside of the teacher’s certification area for a limited period of time.",
