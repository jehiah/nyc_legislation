  "Summary": "This bill would create a standardized application process for City-issued parking permits. Permits could only be issued by the Department of Transportation (DOT), the Police Department, and the Department of Education, if delegated such authority by DOT. Applications would be sponsored by City agencies and each applicant would be required to state the need for the permit. Information on the number of permits requested and issued, disaggregated by sponsoring agency, would be posted online.",
