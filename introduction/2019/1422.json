  "Summary": "This bill would create a standardized application process for City-issued parking permits. Permits could only be issued by the Department of Transportation (DOT), the Police Department, and the Department of Education, if delegated such authority by DOT. Applications would be sponsored by City agencies and each applicant would be required to state the need for the permit. Information on the number of permits requested and issued, disaggregated by sponsoring agency, would be posted online.",

Subchapter 2 of chapter 1 of title 19 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 19-162.3 to read as follows:\n      � 19-162.3 City-issued parking permits. a. Definition. For purposes of this section, the term \"city-issued parking permit\" means a permit issued by the department or the department of education, if the commissioner has delegated authority to the department of education pursuant to subdivision b, that indicates permission to park in certain areas during certain times has been granted. The term shall not include a parking permit issued pursuant to sections 19-162.1 or 19-162.2, a parking permit issued to individuals with disabilities, or a single-use parking permit.\n      b. Issuance. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, and except as provided in section 14-183, no other city agency shall issue a permit that indicates permission to park in certain areas during certain times has been granted; however, the commissioner may delegate authority to the department of education to issue such permits. In the event of such delegation, city-issued parking permits issued by the department of education shall continue to be subject to the requirements of subdivisions c, d, e, f, h, and i and any applicable rules promulgated by the department pursuant to subdivision g.\n      c. Term. A city-issued parking permit shall be valid for no more than one year unless suspended or revoked. \n      d. Application. 1. Each person applying for a city-issued parking permit or renewal thereof on behalf of themselves, their agency or non-profit entity shall file an application in such form and detail as the commissioner may prescribe, which may include inputting the required information into a permit application system. \n      2. An application for a city-issued parking permit or renewal thereof shall include, but need not be limited to, the following information: \n      (a) if applying on behalf of a city agency, the name of the city agency and the employee's relationship to such agency if issued to an individual;\n      (b) the license plate number of the vehicle or vehicles to be associated with such permit when associated with a specific vehicle or vehicles; and\n      (c) a statement articulating the justification for the permit need.   \n      3. Upon the approval of an application, the department shall issue a city-issued parking permit to the applicant that may only be used with the vehicle or vehicles identified on such application when the permit is to be used with specific vehicles. \n      4. City-issued parking permits shall not be transferrable to another person or vehicle if issued to a specific individual or vehicle. \n      5. Whenever any information provided on such an application has changed, such agency shall notify the department within 10 days of such change.\n      e. Form of permits.
