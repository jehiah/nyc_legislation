  "Summary": "This proposed legislation would repeal the existing office of sustainability and replace it with a new Department of Sustainability and Climate Change. A Commissioner would head the new department. The Commissioner would be responsible for all matters relating to resiliency of critical infrastructure, the built environment, coastal protection and coastal communities and climate change.  The commissioner would also be responsible for all matters pertaining to recovery and resiliency and sustainability. The commissioner would have the power to develop and coordinate the implementation of policies, programs and actions to meet the long-term needs of the city, to develop measurable sustainability indicators and to take actions to increase public awareness and education regarding sustainability and climate change.  The proposed legislation also creates a sustainability advisory board with representatives from the environmental, environmental justice, planning, architecture, engineering, oceanography, coastal protection, construction, critical infrastructure, labor, business and academic sectors. The legislation requires reporting on existing or revised sustainability indicators and population projections.  The Commissioner will be required to develop and coordinate the implementation of a   comprehensive, long-term sustainability plan for the city for a period of at least 30 years. The plan is required to set milestones, interim and long-term goals, to be updated every four years and to include annual reports on the city’s progress in improving the sustainability indicators.  Finally, the legislation creates interagency green team to pilot and facilitate the use of innovative technologies, design and construction techniques, materials or products that may have significant environmental and sustainability benefits and to assist innovative projects in addressing local regulatory requirements.",
