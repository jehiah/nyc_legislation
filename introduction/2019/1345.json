The term \"cigarette\" means any roll for smoking made wholly or in part of tobacco or any other substance, irrespective of size or shape and whether or not such tobacco or substance is flavored, adulterated or mixed with any other ingredient, the wrapper or cover of which is made of paper or any other substance or material but is not made in whole or in part of tobacco.\n      [b. \"Characterizing flavor\"] Characterizing flavor.

The term \"tobacco bar\" has the meaning as such term is defined in subdivision jj of section 17-502 of this code.\n      [j. \"Tobacco product\"] Tobacco product. The term \"tobacco product\" means any product which contains tobacco that is intended for human consumption, including any component, part, or accessory of such product. Tobacco product shall include, but not be limited to, any cigar, little cigar, chewing tobacco, pipe tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco, snus, bidi, snuff, tobacco-containing shisha, or dissolvable tobacco product. Tobacco product shall not include cigarettes or any product that has been approved by the United States food and drug administration for sale as a tobacco use cessation product or for other medical purposes and that is being marketed and sold solely for such purposes.\n      � 2.
