  "Summary": "The proposed legislation would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to conduct a study of all HIV/AIDS-related deaths in the city between 2017 and 2019 to assess the causes and circumstances that lead to each death. The department would submit a report to the Council no later than December 31, 2020, outlining the findings of such study. The goal of this legislation is to understand where existing gaps in HIV/AIDS services exist, and how the City can address these gaps.",
