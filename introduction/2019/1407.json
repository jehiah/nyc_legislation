  "Summary": "The proposed legislation would require the Department of Consumer Affairs, in consultation with the Department of Sanitation, the Department of Environmental Protection and the Mayor's Office for People with Disabilities, to conduct a comprehensive study of new waste policy initiatives that will reduce the sale, distribution and use of single use plastic items in the city. The final report would be due on December 1, 2020.",

  "Text": "Proposed Int. No. 1407-A\n\nBy Council Members Levine, Chin, Rivera, Brannan, Van Bramer, Levin, Rosenthal and Reynoso\n\n..Title\nA Local Law, in relation to a study on single-use plastics \n..Body\n \nBe it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      Section 1. As used in this local law, the following terms have the following meanings:\n      Plastic. The term \"plastic\" means a synthetic material made from organic polymers, including, but not limited to, polypropylene and polystyrene, that can be molded into shape while soft, and then set into a rigid or slightly elastic form.\n      Single-use. The term \"single-use\" means a product that is designed and intended to be used only once for drinking or eating, and is generally recognized by the public as an item that is to be discarded after one use.\n      � 2. Single-use plastics study. 1. The department shall, in consultation with the department of sanitation, the department of health and mental hygiene, the department of environmental protection and the mayor's office for people with disabilities, conduct a comprehensive study of new waste policy initiatives that will reduce the sale, distribution and use of single use plastic items. In conducting the study, the department, at a minimum, shall:\n      (a) Conduct a thorough review of the research and literature on reducing single-use plastics;\n      (b) Review laws or regulations in other countries, states, counties, cities or towns aimed at reducing consumer reliance on single-use plastic items, including any effectiveness data and reports available that review the implementation of such laws or regulations;\n       (c) Conduct interviews of scientists, experts, government officials, and representatives of not-for-profit organizations with relevant expertise;\n      (d) Assess the alternatives to single-use plastic items, including availability, cost and whether such alternatives are compatible with the overall goal of waste reduction and the city's existing recycling and composting programs;\n      (e) Conduct a comprehensive review of the recyclability of single-use plastic items in the city and identify categories of single-use plastics that should be prioritized for reduction. As part of this review, the department shall examine the market demand for post-consumer recycled materials and identify opportunities for increasing such market demand;\n      (f) Consult with representatives of affected groups including, but not limited to, people with disabilities, business owners, trade associations, labor unions and consumers; and \n      (g) Retain any experts the department may require to carry out the study.\n      � 3. The department shall on December 1, 2020 submit a final report of its findings to the mayor and the speaker of the city council. The report shall include recommendations for legislation or regulatory actions that would achieve the objective of reducing single-use plastics in the city. \n      � 4. This local law takes effect immediately and remains in effect until the department of consumer affairs has submitted to the mayor and the speaker of the council a report with the results of the single use plastics study.\nAEM/NKA/BAM\nLS # 7044\n9/27/2019\n",
