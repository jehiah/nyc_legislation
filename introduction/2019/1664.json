  "Summary": "This bill would require the Mayor’s Office of Food Policy (MOFP) to consult with relevant agencies, community based organizations, community leaders and food system stakeholders that focus on food policy, food equity, food justice and food insecurity. The plan would set goals to reduce hunger, improve nutrition, increase access to healthy food, reduce food waste, develop and improve food and farm economies, and increase urban agriculture and sustainability. The MOFP would also be required to submit to the Mayor, the Speaker of the Council, and post on its website a report assessing the city’s progress toward the identified goals.",
