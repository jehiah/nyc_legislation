It would further prohibit the City from using the terms “alien,” “illegal alien,” or “illegal immigrant” in any of its laws, documents, or materials unless referencing a federal law or program.",

No. 1836-A\n\nBy Council Members Moya, Louis, Dromm, Kallos, Rosenthal, Constantinides, Powers, Rivera, Chin, Ayala, Barron, Maisel and the Public Advocate (Mr. Williams)\n\n..Title\nA Local Law to amend the New York city charter and the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting the use of the word \"alien\" and removing such words in local laws, rules and other documents and materials\n..Body\n\nBe it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n      Section 1. Chapter 1 of title 1 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 1-114 to read as follows:\n      � 1-114 Language referring to noncitizens. a. Any law, rule, order or other document, or material created by the city shall not use the terms \"alien,\" \"illegal immigrant,\" or \"illegal migrant\" to refer to an individual who is not a citizen of the United States, provided that:\n      1. A law, rule, order, or any other document or material shall not be deemed invalid due to the inclusion of such a term. \n      2. An agency shall not be required to dispose of any printed material that includes such a term if such material was produced prior to the effective date of the local law that added this section, and may use such material until it is exhausted.\n      3. An agency of the city may use such a term in a law, rule, order, or other document or material if the agency determines that using such a term is required pursuant to a state or federal law, or that excluding such term would be inconsistent with state or federal law, or that using such a term is reasonably necessary to achieve the agency's purpose.\n      b. No later than one year after the effective date of this section, each agency shall review its rules and other documents or materials to identify any use of the terms prohibited by subdivision a of this section, and amend any such rule that is in effect on the effective date of this section, or revise any such other document or material, in accordance with this section, provided that the failure to amend any such rule, document or material shall not change the validity thereof, and further provided that this paragraph shall not apply to orders issued before the effective date of this section.\n      � 2. Subparagraphs b and c of paragraph 6 of subdivision e of section 1304 of the New York city charter, as amended by local law 1 for the year 2013, are amended to read as follows:\n      b. For the purposes of such certification, \"minority owned business enterprise\" and \"women owned business enterprise\" shall mean business enterprises authorized to do business in this state, including sole proprietorships, partnerships and corporations, in which (i) at least fifty-one percent of the ownership interest is held by United States citizens or lawful permanent residents [resident aliens] who are either minority group members or women[,]; (ii) the ownership interest of such individuals is real, substantial and continuing[,]; and (iii) such individuals have and exercise the authority to control independently the day to day business decisions of the enterprise;\n      c. For the purposes of such certification, \"emerging business enterprise\" shall mean a business enterprise authorized to do business in this state, including sole proprietorships, partnerships and corporations, in which (i) at least fifty-one percent of the ownership interest is held by United States citizens or lawful permanent residents [resident aliens]; (ii) the ownership interest of such individuals is real, substantial and continuing[,]; (iii) such individuals have and exercise the authority to control independently the day to day business decisions of the enterprise; and (iv) such individuals have demonstrated, in accordance with regulations promulgated by the commissioner, that they are socially and economically disadvantaged. An individual who is \"socially and economically disadvantaged\" shall mean an individual who has experienced social disadvantage in American society as a result of causes not common to individuals who are not socially disadvantaged, and whose ability to compete in the free enterprise system has been impaired due to diminished capital and credit opportunities as compared to others in the same business area who are not socially disadvantaged. An individual's race, national origin, or gender by itself, shall not qualify the individual as \"socially disadvantaged.\" In drafting such regulations, the commissioner shall consider criteria developed for federal programs established to promote opportunities for businesses owned by individuals who are socially and economically disadvantaged, including criteria for determining initial and continued eligibility in relation to the net worth of individuals claiming to be economically disadvantaged, provided that the net worth of an individual claiming disadvantage pursuant to this section must be less than one million dollars. In determining such net worth, the department shall exclude the ownership interest in the business enterprise and the equity in the primary personal residence. \n      � 3.

The commissioner may request and shall receive from any contracting agency of the city such assistance as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section. \"Minority group member\" shall mean a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident [alien] who is a member of a racial or language minority group in New York city protected by the voting rights act of 1965, as amended, or such other groups as may be covered by rule of the agency.\n      � 4. Section 8-101 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 20 for the year 2019, is amended to read as follows: \n      � 8-101 Policy.\n      In the city of New York, with its great cosmopolitan population, there is no greater danger to the health, morals, safety and welfare of the city and its inhabitants than the existence of groups prejudiced against one another and antagonistic to each other because of their actual or perceived differences, including those based on race, color, creed, age, national origin, [alienage] immigration or citizenship status, gender, sexual orientation, disability, marital status, partnership status, caregiver status, sexual and reproductive health decisions, any lawful source of income, status as a victim of domestic violence or status as a victim of sex offenses or stalking, whether children are, may be or would be residing with a person or conviction or arrest record. The council hereby finds and declares that prejudice, intolerance, bigotry, and discrimination, bias-related violence or harassment and disorder occasioned thereby threaten the rights and proper privileges of its inhabitants and menace the institutions and foundation of a free democratic state. A city agency is hereby created with power to eliminate and prevent discrimination from playing any role in actions relating to employment, public accommodations, and housing and other real estate, and to take other actions against prejudice, intolerance, bigotry, discrimination and bias-related violence or harassment as herein provided; and the commission established hereunder is hereby given general jurisdiction and power for such purposes.\n      � 5. Section 8-102 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 185 for the year 2019, is amended by amending the definition of \"alienage or citizenship status\", and setting forth such amended definition in alphabetical order to read as follows:\n      [Alienage] Immigration or citizenship status. The term \"[alienage] immigration or citizenship status\" means:\n1. The citizenship of any person, or\n2. The immigration status of any person who is not a citizen or national of the United States. \n      � 6.
