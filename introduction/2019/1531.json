  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of City Planning (DCP) or the lead agency to report on the actual impacts on public school capacity and overcrowding in areas affected by neighborhood rezonings four years and ten years after each such rezoning.  Each study would require a comparison of the public school capacity and utilization rates projected by the  final environmental impact statement approved by the City Planning Commission in connection with such rezoning to the capacity and utilization rates existing at the time of each study.  If such a study shows a significant discrepancy between the existing condition and the impacts projected in the EIS, the bill would require DCP or the lead agency to make recommendations on how to amend the CEQR Technical Manual to more accurately forecast such impacts in future land use actions.",

The department or the lead agency shall issue each report prepared pursuant to this subdivision no later than six months after the end of the applicable study period described in subdivision b of this section.\n      � 2.
