  "Summary": "This bill would update Consumer Protection Law (CPL) penalty amounts and make clear that DCWP can seek daily penalties for deceptive conduct. The bill would also clarify DCWP’s power to combat online deceptive practices and define as deceptive a business’s failure to provide transactional document translations. The bill would make explicit the forms of relief for CPL violations that DCWP can seek at OATH and allow DCWP to initiate a state court case through a proceeding. This bill would also reinstate the licensing scheme for industrial laundries and businesses that engage in industrial laundry delivery and create a separate regulatory scheme for retail laundries. Additionally, this bill would codify a higher civil penalty for persons who harass DCWP personnel and require amusement operators to inform DCWP of any accidents. Finally, this bill would make technical corrections in title 20 of the Administrative Code and revise an effective date provision of local law number 80 for 2021.",
