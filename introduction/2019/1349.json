It would also require the department to train its officers on the new procedures, and report on instances in which no alternate caregiver for the child can be identified.",

When an alternate caregiver is unable to arrive at the scene of arrest within a reasonable amount of time, making a referral to a partner organization or bringing the child to the borough's child advocacy center. If no alternate caregiver is identified or the identified caregiver does not arrive in a reasonable amount of time, or if the child advocacy center or partner organization is unavailable, notifying the New York state central register of the office of children and family services and notifying the administration for children's services borough field office or the administration for children's services' emergency children's services program or its equivalent. \n      10.
