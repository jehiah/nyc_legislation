Subdivision c of section 12-127 of chapter 1 of title 12 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 41 for the year 2004, is amended to read as follows:\n      c. (1) Definitions. For purposes of this subdivision, the term \"occupational disease\" has the same meaning as such term is defined in section 2 of the workers' compensation law.\n      (2) Each agency shall keep a record of, and shall, as soon as practicable, transmit to the law department, any workers' compensation claim filed by an employee, the subject of which concerns an injury sustained in the course of duty while such employee was employed at such agency.
