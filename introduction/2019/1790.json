  "Summary": "The 2002 Living Wage Law requires certain City human services contractors and subcontractors to pay a living wage to their employees. The living wage is defined to be $10 per hour plus health care benefits, or a supplemental health benefits rate of $1.50 per hour in lieu of such health care benefits. Wages for human services workers covered by the law have been stagnant at $10 per hour for over a decade. This bill would raise the living wage for such human services workers to $15 per hour and the health benefits supplement rate to $1.75 per hour.",
