  "Summary": "The 2002 Living Wage Law requires certain City human services contractors and subcontractors to pay a living wage to their employees. The living wage is defined to be $10 per hour plus health care benefits, or a supplemental health benefits rate of $1.50 per hour in lieu of such health care benefits. Wages for human services workers covered by the law have been stagnant at $10 per hour for over a decade. This bill would raise the living wage for such human services workers to $15 per hour and the health benefits supplement rate to $1.75 per hour.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection 1. Paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision b of section 6-109 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 38 for the year 2002, are amended to read as follows:\n      (2) The Living Wage. The living wage shall be an hourly wage rate of [ten dollars per hour and will be phased in as provided below] $15 per hour. Beginning in 2019 and each year thereafter, the living wage rate and the health benefits supplement rate shall be adjusted based upon the 12-month percentage increases, if any, in the consumer price index for all urban consumers for all items and the consumer price index for all urban consumers for medical care, respectively, or their successor indexes, if any, as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the federal department of labor, based on the most recent 12-month period for which data is available. The adjusted living wage rate and health benefits supplement rate shall each then be rounded to the nearest five cents. [Provided, however, that for homecare services under the Personal Care Services program, the wage and health rates below shall only apply as long as the state and federal government maintain their combined aggregate proportionate share of funding and approved rates for homecare services in effect as of the date of the enactment of this section:\n      (a) As of the effective date of this section, $8.10 per hour;\n      (b) As of July 1, 2003, $8.60 per hour; \n      (c) As of July 1, 2004, $9.10 per hour;\n      (d) As of July 1, 2005, $9.60 per hour;\n      (e) As of July 1, 2006, $10.00 per hour.]\n      (3) Health Benefits.
