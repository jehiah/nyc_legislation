  "Summary": "In order to help alleviate noise pollution related to police, fire, ambulance and other emergency service vehicle sirens, this bill would require that all sirens transition over a two-year period to alternating high and low, two-toned signals similar to those heard in many European countries. These signals have been found to be as effective as those currently used by emergency services but without as shrill or invasive an impact on communities.",

Section 24-241 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law 113 for the year 2005, is amended to read as follows:\n      � 24-241. Emergency signal devices. [(a)]a. No person shall operate or use or cause to be operated or used any emergency signal device, except on an authorized emergency vehicle when such vehicle is in the act of responding to an emergency; provided that such device shall not be operated for a period of time longer than is necessary to respond to such emergency. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such a device on a motor vehicle shall be lawful if designed and used solely as an audible motor vehicle burglar alarm in accordance with section 24-238 and a device attached to a vehicle for the purpose of providing an audible warning when the vehicle is backing up shall be permitted even though the audible warning may consist of a gong or bell sound.\n      [(b)]b. No person shall operate or permit to be operated an emergency signal device installed on an authorized emergency vehicle [that] unless:\n      1.
