  "Summary": "In order to help alleviate noise pollution related to police, fire, ambulance and other emergency service vehicle sirens, this bill would require that all sirens transition over a two-year period to alternating high and low, two-toned signals similar to those heard in many European countries. These signals have been found to be as effective as those currently used by emergency services but without as shrill or invasive an impact on communities.",
