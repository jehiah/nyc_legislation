  "Summary": "The proposed legislation would create a traffic infraction punishable by a fine of up to $50 for back seat passengers sixteen years or over not using a safety belt and/or for drivers who fail to ensure safety belt use of their back seat passengers sixteen years or over, other than those drivers transporting passengers for hire pursuant to a Taxi and Limousine Commission license.\r\n\r\nThe proposed legislation would exempt buses, including school buses, and authorized emergency vehicles, mirroring provisions in State law. It would also exempt passengers with a physically disabling condition duly certified by a physician that would prevent safety belt use, and provide an affirmative defense for passengers of for hire vehicles that the vehicle in which they are a traveling lacks a visible, accessible, and working back seat safety belt.",

In addition to any requirements set forth in section 1229-c of the vehicle and traffic law:\n            a. No person 16 years of age or over shall be a passenger in a back seat of a motor vehicle within the city of New York unless such person is restrained by a safety belt approved by the commissioner of the state department of transportation.\n            b.

In any proceeding alleging a violation of subdivision a of this section by a passenger in the back seat of a taxi or livery vehicle, it shall be an affirmative defense that such taxi or livery vehicle was in violation of subdivision 4-b of section 383 of the vehicle and traffic law, requiring the installation, in a taxi or livery vehicle, of a back seat safety belt that is visible, accessible and maintained in good working order.\n            � 2.
