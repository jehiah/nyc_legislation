It would also exempt passengers with a physically disabling condition duly certified by a physician that would prevent safety belt use, and provide an affirmative defense for passengers of for hire vehicles that the vehicle in which they are a traveling lacks a visible, accessible, and working back seat safety belt.","TextID":65986,"Text":"Int.
