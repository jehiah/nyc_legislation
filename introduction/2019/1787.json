DCA would also be required to provide domestic workers, in particular, with information about hazardous cleaning products, including less hazardous options and the use of protective equipment. One year after the effective date, DCA would be required to provide a report regarding interest in the program, attendance at trainings, the cost of the program, the efficacy of the program and recommendations about the program.",
