  "Summary": "This bill would create a good food purchasing program and advisory board. The advisory board would include the commissioners of agencies that execute food procurement contracts, seven members appointed by the Mayor and seven members appointed by the Speaker with knowledge of the good food purchasing program value categories. The advisory board would conduct baseline assessments of each agency’s food procurement processes, then develop and submit a five-year plan with one-year, three-year and five-year benchmarks. The advisory board would evaluate the contract bids that are submitted, and each agency may consider the board’s assessments. The advisory board would submit a progress report with recommendations to each agency, the Mayor and the Speaker, post the report on the website of the Mayor’s Office of Food Policy and hold a public hearing about its findings.",
