The advisory board would conduct baseline assessments of each agency’s food procurement processes, then develop and submit a five-year plan with one-year, three-year and five-year benchmarks. The advisory board would evaluate the contract bids that are submitted, and each agency may consider the board’s assessments. The advisory board would submit a progress report with recommendations to each agency, the Mayor and the Speaker, post the report on the website of the Mayor’s Office of Food Policy and hold a public hearing about its findings.","TextID":67206,"Text":"Int.
