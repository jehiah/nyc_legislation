  "Summary": "The bill amends Section § 3-126 of the Administrative code to amend subdivision d and add a new subdivision g. The local law mandates an assessment on the feasibility of replacing in-city gas fired power plants with battery storage powered by renewable sources by the mayor’s office of sustainability or such other office as the mayor may designate. Such an assessment shall include when such replacement could take place, and a review of potential technologies for battery storage of energy. The assessment will be part of the long-term energy plan and shall be updated every four years.",
