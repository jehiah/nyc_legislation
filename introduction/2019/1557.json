  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation (“DOT”) to issue and implement a transportation master plan every five years. The plan’s goals would be to prioritize the safety of all street users, the use of mass transit, the reduction of vehicle emissions, and access for individuals with disabilities. Each plan would include certain benchmarks. The first plan would be due in December of 2021 and would include:\r\n• 150 miles of physically or camera-protected bus lanes over five years, with at least 20 miles in the first year and at least 30 miles during each subsequent year;\r\n• Transit signal priority at 750 intersections during the first year and 1,000 intersections during each subsequent year;\r\n• 250 miles of protected bike lanes over five years, with at least 30 miles in the first year and 50 miles in each subsequent year;\r\n• Bus stop upgrades like benches, shelters, and real-time passenger information at 500 bus stops each year;\r\n• Redesigning at least 2,000 signalized intersections over five years, with at least 400 redesigns each year;\r\n• Accessible pedestrian signals at no fewer than 2,500 intersections, with at least 500 installations each year;\r\n• Assessing and amending commercial loading zones and truck routes;\r\n• Developing parking policies to promote the master plan’s goals of safety, mass transit use, reduced vehicle emissions, and access for individuals with disabilities; and\r\n• Within the first two years, create and maintain one million square feet of pedestrian space.\r\n  The following master plan, due in 2026, would include the completion of a connected bike lane network, installation of physically or camera-protected bus lanes on all routes where they can be installed, installation of accessible pedestrian signals at no fewer than 2,500 intersections over five years, installation of bus stop upgrades at all bus stops, redesign at least 2,000 intersections over five years, and installation of pedestrian ramps at no fewer than 3,000 street corners.\r\n  The bill also requires reporting in February of each year regarding an update on any changes to the master plan and the progress towards achieving the benchmarks laid out in the plan.\r\nFinally, DOT would be required to conduct a public education campaign on the benefits of each master plan.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n \n      Section 1. Subchapter 3 of chapter 1 of title 19 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 19-199.1 to read as follows:\n      � 19-199.1 Master plan. a. Definitions.

The term \"protected bicycle lane\" means a portion of a street or intersection that is designated for the exclusive use of bicycles and that is separated from motorized vehicle traffic by physical barriers, or is an off-road or raised pathway.\n      Protected bus lane. The term \"protected bus lane\" means a bus lane that is protected by physical barriers or is monitored by stationary or mobile bus lane photo devices that automatically produce an image of any vehicle that violates a bus lane restriction at the time of such violation.\n      Shared street.
