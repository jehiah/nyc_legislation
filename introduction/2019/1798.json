  "Summary": "This bill would require that gym memberships that provide for an automatic renewal after a definite term or that continue until the consumer cancels the membership must allow the consumer to cancel the membership online. In addition, the party providing the gym membership would be required to provide a plain language notice explaining how it may be cancelled online. The bill also would impose a civil penalty of between $500 and $5,000 for each violation.",
