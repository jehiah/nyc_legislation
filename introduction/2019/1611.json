  "Summary": "This bill would expand the role of the Business Integrity Commission (BIC) in reviewing waste transfer stations, dumps and fill material operations that are required to get a permit from the Department of Sanitation. These businesses would be required to provide certain information and comply with certain requirements that would enable BIC to assess their good character, honesty and integrity. The Department of Sanitation would use BIC’s assessment in determining whether to grant, renew or revoke permits. In addition, this bill would require labor unions that represent or seek to represent employees of waste transfer stations to register with BIC.",
