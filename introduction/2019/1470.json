  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Small Business Services (“SBS”) to provide individualized legal assistance to small business tenants on commercial lease-related issues free of charge, through a designated organization. It would also empower SBS to provide legal representation in court for small business tenants facing eviction, lease termination or allegations that the businesses had breached their lease terms, at no cost to the small business tenant, through a designated organization. SBS would also be required to provide assistance to small businesses with regards to funding programs related to COVID-19, such as loans and grants, until 180 days after the Mayor’s declaration of a state of emergency expires. All these programs would be subject to appropriation.  Additionally, SBS would have to report on the outcomes of the programs established by the bill, including certain characteristics of the businesses served and the designated organizations who provided the programs.",
