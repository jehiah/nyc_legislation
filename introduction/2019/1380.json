  "Summary": "Proposed Int. No. 1380-A would require the New York City Department of Education to annually report on claims for payment for tuition or services, for the preceding academic year, that resulted in a written settlement agreement with the Department. These claims are made by parents of a student with a disability pursuant to a due process complaint notice filed during the preceding academic year or a ten-day notice filed when parents believe their child is not receiving appropriate special education services in public school.  The bill would also require the Department to report on the number of impartial hearing officers certified by the state education department to cover New York City, how many of those hearing officers had their certification revoked by the state education department, and how many cases hearing officers recused themselves from.",
