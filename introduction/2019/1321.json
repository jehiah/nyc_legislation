  "Summary": "Local Law 27 of 2012 (the “Prevailing Wage Law”) requires payment of prevailing wages to building service employees in buildings where a private developer receives at least $1,000,000 in discretionary financial assistance from the City or a City economic development entity for a City development project.  \r\nThe proposed bill would cover additional developers and projects by removing the current exemption in the Prevailing Wage Law for affordable housing projects and not-for-profit developers of residential projects. Accordingly, building service workers in most residential projects receiving financial assistance of at least $1,000,000 for new construction or preservation would be required to be paid the prevailing wage. The bill exempts smaller residential projects with fewer than 120 units, certain supportive housing projects, deeply affordable preservation projects and NYCHA projects financed through the federal Rental Assistance Demonstration program.",

Prior to commencing work at a preservation project, and annually thereafter, every protected developer shall provide to the city or the city economic development entity and the comptroller an annual certification executed under penalty of perjury that all building service employees subject to subparagraph (B) of paragraph 1 of this section, who are employed at a preservation project by the protected developer or under contract with the protected developer to perform building service work will be and/or have been paid no less than the protected wage. Such certification shall include a record of the days and hours worked and the wages and benefits paid to each building service employee employed at the city development project or preservation project, or under contract with the covered developer or protected developer. Such certification shall be certified by the chief executive or chief financial officer of the covered developer or protected developer, or the designee of any such person. A violation of any provision of the certification, or failure to provide such certification, shall constitute a violation of this section by the party committing the violation of such provision.\n\t(3) Each covered developer and protected developer shall maintain original payroll records for each building service employee subject to subparagraphs (A) or (B) of paragraph 1 of this section reflecting the days and hours worked, and the wages paid and benefits provided for such hours worked, and shall retain such records for at least six years after the building service work is performed. The covered developer or protected developer may satisfy this requirement by obtaining copies of records from the employer or employers of such employees. Failure to maintain such records as required shall create a rebuttable presumption that the building service employees were not paid the wages and benefits required under this section. Upon the request of the comptroller or the city, the covered developer or protected developer shall provide a certified original payroll record.\n       (4) No later than the day on which any work begins at any city economic development project or preservation project subject to the requirements of this section, a covered developer or protected developer shall post in a prominent and accessible place at every such city economic development project or preservation project, as applicable, and provide each building service employee subject to subparagraphs (A) or (B) of paragraph 1 of this section a copy of a written notice, prepared by the comptroller, detailing the wages, benefits, and other protections to which building service employees are entitled under this section. Such notice shall also provide the name, address and telephone number of the comptroller and a statement advising such building service employees that if they have been paid less that the prevailing wage or protected wage, as applicable, they may notify the comptroller and request an investigation. Such [notices] notice shall be provided in English and Spanish. Such notice shall remain posted for the duration of the [lease] applicable period as set forth in paragraph 6 of this subdivision and shall be adjusted periodically to reflect the current prevailing wage for building service employees. The comptroller shall provide the city with sample written notices explaining the rights of building service employees and covered developers' or protected developers' obligations under this section, and the city shall in turn provide those written notices to covered developers and protected developers.\n       (6) The requirements of this section shall apply for the term of the financial assistance, for ten years from the date that the financially assisted project opens, or for the duration of any written agreement between a city agency or city economic development entity and a covered developer or protected developer providing for financial assistance, whichever is longer.\n      � 4. Paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4) and (6) of subdivision d of section 6-130 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 27 for the year 2012, are amended to read as follows:\n      (1) [No later than October 1, 2012, the] The mayor or his or her designee shall promulgate implementing rules and regulations as appropriate and consistent with this section and may delegate such authority to the comptroller. Beginning twelve months after the enactment of the local law that added this section, the comptroller shall submit annual reports to the mayor and the city council summarizing and assessing the implementation and enforcement of this section during the preceding year.\n      (2) In addition to failure to comply with subdivisions b and c of this section, it shall be a violation of this section for any covered lessor [or], covered developer or protected developer to discriminate or retaliate against any building service employee who makes a claim that he or she is owed wages due as provided under this section or otherwise seeks information regarding, or enforcement of, this section.\n      (3) The comptroller shall monitor covered lessors' [and], covered [employers'] developers' and protected developers' compliance with the requirements of this section. Whenever the comptroller has reason to believe there has been a violation of this section, or upon a verified complaint in writing from a building service employee, a former building service employee, or a building service employee's representative claiming a violation of this section, the comptroller shall conduct an investigation to determine the facts relating thereto. At the start of such investigation, the comptroller may, in a manner consistent with the withholding procedures established by subdivision 2 of section 235 of the [state] labor law, request that the relevant contracting agency or entity withhold any payment due to the covered lessor [or], covered developer or protected developer in order to safeguard the rights of the building service employees.\n      (4) The comptroller shall report the results of such investigation to the mayor or his or her designee, who shall, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 6 of this subdivision and after providing the covered lessor [or],  covered developer or protected developer an opportunity to cure any violations, where appropriate issue an order, determination, or other disposition, including, but not limited to, a stipulation of settlement.
