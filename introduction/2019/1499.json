  "Summary": "This legislation would prohibit any individual from charging a prospective tenant a fee in order to obtain a tenant screening report when the individual knows the unit is not or will not be vacant for such prospective tenant to lease. This bill would also require such individual to provide an applicant with the tenant screening report as long as the required fee has been paid, regardless of whether or not a lease has been signed. This legislation would also require the Department of Consumer Affairs to conduct a feasibility study on whether the city could establish its own tenant screening report system.",
