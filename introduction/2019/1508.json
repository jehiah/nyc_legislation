Section 3004.5.1 of the New York City building code, as amended by local law 141 for the year 2013, is amended to read as follows:\n3004.5.1 Vents in the hoistway enclosures. Hoistway enclosures may be vented in accordance with the following:\n\nLocation of vents.\n\n1.1. The vents in the side of the hoistway enclosure below the elevator machine room floor or in the roof of the hoistway shall open either directly to the outer air or through noncombustible ducts to the outer air.\n\n1.2. The vents in the wall or roof of an overhead elevator machine room through the smoke hole in the top of the elevator hoistway shall be vented to the outer air through noncombustible ducts.\n\nArea of vents. The area of vents in the hoistway or the elevator machine room and the smoke hole shall be not less than 31/2 percent of the area of the hoistway nor less than 3 square feet (0.28 m2) for each elevator car, whichever is greater. Such vents shall comply with the following requirements:\n\n2.1. [Open vents. Of the total required vent area, not less than one-third shall be permanently open or equipped with an openable hinged damper. The smoke hole shall be permanently open.] Automated vents. The total required vent area shall be closed and all of the vent openings shall automatically open:\n\n2.1.1. Upon detection of smoke in the elevator lobbies or hoistway; \n\n2.1.2. Upon power failure (except when provided with a code compliant standby power supply from an approved standby power source); or\n\n2.1.3. Upon activation of a manual override control, which shall be located in an approved location.\n\n2.2. [Closed vents. The two-thirds closed portion of the required vent area either in the hoistway enclosure or in the elevator machine room may consist of windows or skylights glazed with annealed glass not more than 1/8-inch (3.2 mm) thick. A closed damper that opens upon the activation of a smoke detector placed at the top of the hoistway shall be considered closed.] Vents in existing buildings. In existing buildings, of the  total required vent area: \n\n2.2.1. One-third and the smoke hole shall be permanently open; and\n\n2.2.2. Two-thirds shall be closed and may consist of windows or skylights glazed with annealed glass not more than ?-inch (3.2 mm) thick. A closed damper that opens upon the activation of a smoke detector placed at the top of the hoistway shall be considered closed. \n\n2.2.3. This Item 2.2 shall be retroactive and shall apply to all buildings in existence on the effective date of this provision and such buildings shall achieve compliance no later than December 31, 2019.\n\n[Exception: The total required open vent area shall not be required to be permanently open where all of the vent openings automatically open upon detection of smoke in the elevator lobbies or hoistway, upon power failure (except when provided with a code compliant standby power supply from an approved standby power source) or upon activation of a manual override control. The manual override control shall be capable of opening and closing the vents and shall be located in an approved location.]\n\n\n\t� 3. This local law takes effect 120 days after it becomes law, except that the commissioner of buildings shall take such actions as are necessary for its implementation, including the promulgation of rules, prior to such effective date. \n\nEAA/GP/MPC\nLS# 2204\n1/9/18\n1\n\n\n",
