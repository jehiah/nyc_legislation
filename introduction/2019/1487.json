  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Housing Preservation and Development to conduct a study in connection with each neighborhood rezoning certified after January 1, 2015, to identify the actual secondary residential displacement effects of each such rezoning five years after the final approval thereof.  The bill would require the reporting of such effects and an comparison of the actual effects to the potential effects identified in connection with the rezoning application.  The bill would require the Department to issue such report 5 years and 6 months after the final approval of a neighborhood rezoning application.",
