No retail food establishment or food service establishment, or agent thereof, shall store, keep, maintain, offer for sale, or sell any force-fed product or food containing a force-fed product. For purposes of this chapter, it shall be a rebuttable presumption that an item in a retail food establishment or food service establishment having the label \"foie gras\" or listed on a menu as \"foie gras\" is a force-fed product. A party seeking to rebut such presumption shall provide documentary evidence proving that the product they are storing, keeping, maintaining, offering for sale, or selling is not a force-fed product as defined in this chapter.\n\t� 17-1903 Enforcement. a. Any person who is found to violate any provision of this chapter shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $500 and not more than $2,000 for each violation.

The department of consumer affairs shall commence a proceeding to recover a civil penalty in connection with a retail food establishment by service of a notice of violation returnable at the office of administrative trials and hearings or within any agency of the city designated to conduct such proceedings.  \n\t� 2.
