However, there are a limited number of studies that indicate whether there is a need to assist such businesses in obtaining government contracts. Because New York City is a leader in providing equality and fairness to all people, this bill would require the New York City Department of Small Business Services to conduct a study to determine whether LGBT-owned businesses in New York City face difficulties participating in the City’s procurement process.","TextID":62033,"Text":"Int.
