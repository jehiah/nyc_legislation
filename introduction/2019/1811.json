In the zone, the Department of Transportation would be required to establish additional pedestrian flow zones where necessary to accommodate demand for pedestrian space. The department would also have the authority to add new designated activity zones for commercial activities. The bill would also clarify that persons engaged in designated activities are deemed to be engaged in such activities for the entirety of their interactions with the public for the purpose of providing commercial activity.","TextID":70480,"Text":"Int.
