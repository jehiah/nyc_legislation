  "Summary": "This bill would require an online citywide equitable development data tool with citywide, borough wide, and where statistically reliable data is available, neighborhood level and community district level data.  Data would be provided for six specific categories, and be disaggregated by race and ethnicity, where available.  Racial equity reports on housing and opportunity would be required for certain land use applications, using data from the equitable development data tool. The substance of racial equity reports would vary by application type, but all would include a statement of how the proposed project relates to the goals and strategies to affirmatively further fair housing and promote equitable access to opportunity.  Residential projects would state the expected rents for market rate and affordable units and the incomes needed to afford them without incurring housing cost burden.  The equitable development data tool would provide the race/ethnicity for such households.",
