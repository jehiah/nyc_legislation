  "Summary": "This bill would require that any retailer that sells balloons constructed using metallic materials to attach a label to each balloon with a warning about the dangers of metallic balloons colliding with power lines and the retailer’s identifying information. Retailers would also be required to attach weights to any balloon filled with gas lighter than air. Any retailer that violates this law would be subject to a civil penalty of at least $100 for each balloon sold or offered for sale in violation, with a maximum total daily penalty of $2,000.",
