  "Summary": "This bill would require that the Department of Buildings, the Department of Consumer Affairs, the Department of Mental Health and Hygiene, the Department of Environmental Protection, the Department of Sanitation, the Department of Transportation, the Fire Department, the Department of Finance, and the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings, convene a regulatory review panel and, with assistance from the Department of Small Business Services, evaluate provisions of the Administrative Code, the Rules of the City of New York, the New York City Health Code, the New York City Construction Codes, and relevant state laws to determine whether provisions of these laws or rules can be repealed, or whether cure periods can be implemented. These agencies will then draft a report based on their findings and make recommendations for legislation and rules implementing cure periods. The public will have an opportunity provide feedback on the report before it is submitted to the Council.",
