  "Summary": "This bill would require the development of a protocol for identifying the languages spoken by callers to 311. The bill would also create a reporting requirement of the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications. The department would be required to report on instances where calls were disconnected for failure to receive appropriate language assistance.",

Chapter 3 of title 23 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to add a new section 23-304 to read as follows:\n      � 23-304 Identification of spoken language. a. The 311 customer service center shall implement a protocol for identifying the language spoken by a telephone caller to the 311 customer service center.\n      b. Such protocol shall include the use of automated language recognition software to assist in the identification, either for an automated message system or for the call taker, of the language possibly spoken by the caller.\n      c. The 311 customer service center shall examine every call that disconnects during the process of identifying the caller's language without having completed such process, determine the cause of such disconnection, and implement remedies for such disconnections where appropriate to ensure that callers to the 311 system in any language are properly addressed. By January 30 of each year, the department of information technology and telecommunications shall submit to the council and post on its website a report summarizing such causes and remedies.\n      � 2.
