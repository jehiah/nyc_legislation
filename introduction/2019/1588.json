  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Education to post a report online which contains a list of elevator service outages occurring in its schools. It would also require the Department to create a publicly available web tool that would display certain key indicators. The user would be able to compare these indicators across various schools to find out the frequency and length of elevator service outages, as well as whether the building remained accessible when an elevator was out of service.",
