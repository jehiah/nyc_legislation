  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Education to post a report online which contains a list of elevator service outages occurring in its schools. It would also require the Department to create a publicly available web tool that would display certain key indicators. The user would be able to compare these indicators across various schools to find out the frequency and length of elevator service outages, as well as whether the building remained accessible when an elevator was out of service.",

Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings: \n      Elevator. The term \"elevator\" means a hoisting and lowering mechanism equipped with a car or platform that moves in a substantially vertical direction, and that serves two or more floors of a building.\n      Elevator service outage.

Beginning on January 1, 2020, and every three months thereafter, on the first day of the month or within one week of such day, the department shall publicly post to its website a report consisting of all elevator service outages that occurred in its schools within the previous three month reporting period. Such report may be removed from the website no earlier than 15 years after the latest date in a reporting period.\n      c. The report required by subdivision b of this section shall include, at a minimum, the following information with respect to each elevator service outage:\n      1. The name of each school in which the outage occurred;\n      2. The location of each school in which the outage occurred;\n      3. The total number of elevators in the school building in which the outage occurred which are, if in service, available for use by the public;\n      4. Whether, when the outage first occurred, there were any other elevators in service and available for use by the public; \n      5. The duration, in minutes, of the outage; \n      6.

Total number of elevator service outages in each school; \n      2. Total number of instances in each school in which, when the elevator service outage first occurred, there were no other elevators alternatively available for use by the public; and\n      3. Average duration of elevator service outages in each school. \nIf the elevator service outage data for a complete school year cannot yet be posted on the department's website, the department shall display the data required by this subdivision for the period consisting of the beginning of the most recent school year to the most recent date for which data is available. \n      � 2.
