Such study would also seek to identify patterns of unsubstantiated complaints against specific properties. A report on the findings of the study would be due to the Council on December 1, 2021. Such report would be required to include recommendations on the types of 311 complaints that agencies should allow to be made anonymously.","TextID":69621,"Text":"Int.
