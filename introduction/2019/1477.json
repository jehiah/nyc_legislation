  "Summary": "This bill would prohibit the elective declawing of healthy kittens and cats for non-therapeutic purposes. Declaw procedures would only be permitted when medically necessary and performed by a licensed veterinarian on a cat or kitten under anesthesia. The penalty for performing a non-therapeutic declaw procedure would be at least $500 or at most $700. A veterinarian who performs a non-therapeutic declaw procedure would be reported to the State Department of Education and Board of Regents for disciplinary action due to unprofessional conduct.",
