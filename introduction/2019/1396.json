  "Summary": "This bill would require that when a fast food employer needs to layoff employees, that such employer discharge employees by inverse seniority, i.e. those hired last will be discharged first. This proposed bill provides for arbitration of disagreements between fast food employers and fast employees and entitles laid off fast food employees to schedule pay premiums.",

The term \"seniority\" means a ranking of employees based on length of service, computed from the first date of work, including any probationary period, unless such service has been interrupted by more than six months, in which case length of service shall be computed from the date that service resumed. An absence shall not be deemed an interruption of service if such absence was the result of military service, illness, educational leave, leave protected or afforded by law, or any discharge based on a bona fide economic reason or that is in violation of any local, state or federal law, including this subchapter.\n      � 2.

On or after January 1, 2022, any person or organization representing persons alleging a violation of this subchapter by a fast food employer may bring an arbitration proceeding.  In addition, the department may, to the extent permitted by any applicable law including the civil practice law and rules, provide by rule for persons bringing such a proceeding to serve as a representative party on behalf of all members of a class. Such a proceeding must be brought within 2 years of the date of the alleged violation.  If the arbitrator finds that the fast food employer violated the provisions of this subchapter, it shall (i) require the fast food employer to pay the reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of the fast food employee, (ii) require the fast food employer to reinstate or restore the hours of the fast food employee, unless the employee waives reinstatement, (iii) require the fast food employer to pay the city for the costs of the arbitration proceeding, and (iv) award all other appropriate equitable relief, which may include back pay, rescission of discipline, in addition to other relief, and such other compensatory damages or injunctive relief as may be appropriate.\n      b. A person or organization bringing an arbitration proceeding under subdivision a must serve the arbitration demand, and any amendments thereto, on the fast food employer either in person or via certified mail at the current or most recent fast food establishment where each fast food employee named in the arbitration demand is or was employed, or pursuant to the rules for service specified in article 3 of the civil practice law and rules. Such arbitration demand must include a general description of each alleged violation but need not reference the precise section alleged to have been violated.\n      c.

If the committee established pursuant to subdivision c of this section is unable to select a sufficient number of arbitrators for the panel as determined by the department, the department shall select the remaining arbitrators.\n      f. If the parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, the department shall select an arbitrator from the panel.\n      g. The department shall provide interpretation services to any party requiring such services for the arbitration hearing.\n      h. The arbitration hearing shall be held at a location designated by the department or a location agreed to by the parties and the arbitrator. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, such arbitration shall be subject to the labor arbitration rules established by the American arbitration association and the rules promulgated by the department to implement this subchapter.

If a fast food employee brings an arbitration proceeding, arbitration shall be the exclusive remedy for the wrongful discharge dispute and there shall be no right to bring or continue a private cause of action or administrative complaint under this subchapter, unless such arbitration proceeding has been withdrawn or dismissed without prejudice.\n      j. Each party shall have the right to apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the confirmation, modification or vacatur of an award pursuant to article 75 of the civil practice law and rules, as such article applies, pursuant to applicable case law, to review of legally mandated arbitration proceedings in accordance with standards of due process.\n      � 7.

If the job opening or additional shift is not filled pursuant to paragraph 1 of this subdivision, before a fast food employer may hire new fast food employees, including hiring through the use of subcontractors,  a fast food employer shall offer regular shifts or on call shifts that would otherwise be offered to a new fast food employee to the fast food employer's current fast food employees employed at all fast food establishments owned by the fast food employer, or at a subset of such fast food establishments as provided in rules promulgated pursuant to subdivision j of this section. A fast food employer may not transfer fast food employees from locations other than the location where such shifts will be worked or hire new fast food employees, including subcontractors, to perform the work of fast food employees for such shifts, except as provided for in subdivisions f, g and of this section.\n      � 8. This local law takes effect at the same time and in the same manner that a local law for the year 2020 amending the administrative code of the city of New York in relation in relation to wrongful discharge of fast food employees, as proposed in introduction number 1415-A for the year 2019, takes effect, except that the commissioner of the department of consumer and worker protection may take such measures as are necessary for the implementation of this local law, including the promulgation of rules, before such effective date.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMMB/LCB\nLS # 8321 and LS # 5994\n12/9/20 5:21 PM",
