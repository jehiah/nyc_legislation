  "Summary": "This bill would establish an advisory committee on female genital mutilation and cutting (FGM/C) within the Mayor’s Office to End Domestic and Gender-Based Violence (ENDGBV). The committee, headed by the ENDGBV commissioner or their designee, would make recommendations to engage communities and agencies in decreasing, with the goal of eventually eliminating, the practice of female genital mutilation and cutting in the city, and would identify supportive community-based and culturally-responsive resources for people who have undergone female genital mutilation and cutting. The mayor or their designee would appoint advisory committee members from various fields, including City government, healthcare, and non-profit organizations, among others. The advisory committee would be required to meet a minimum of two times per year for two years, after which time ENDGBV would assess the continued need for such advisory committee. ENDGBV would also be required to report on the advisory committee’s activities in its annual report, or if the advisory committee were dissolved, continue to include a description of the office’s work in relation to FGM/C in its annual report.",
