  "Summary": "This bill would require the Mayor to appoint an agency to conduct a study of the shoreline and all shoreline protection structures in New York City. The agency would prepare recommendations for maintaining shoreline protection structures that are functional, for replacing those that are deteriorating, and for adding them where they do not exist. Such recommendations would include using living shoreline techniques or environmentally responsible alternatives to traditional concrete material where feasible.  The agency would submit the report to the Mayor and Council and make its recommendations publicly available on its website.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Shoreline protection structures study. a. Definitions. For purposes of this local law the following terms have the following meanings:\n      Environmental concrete.  The term \"environmental concrete\" means material that is used for shoreline protection, as an alternative to traditional concrete material, can enhance or encourage the growth of flora or fauna when placed in a marine environment, and results in the production of fewer greenhouse gas emissions than traditional concrete material. Environmental concrete may include recycled materials, such as recycled or reclaimed concrete material. \n      Living shoreline technique. The term \"living shoreline technique\" means a coastal infrastructure design that incorporates natural living features such as plants, soil or other naturally occurring elements, alone or in combination with structural components such as rock, fiber rolls, bagged shell or similar materials, that functions to protect the coast from erosion and flooding while maintaining upland and water habitats.\n      Shoreline protection structure. The term \"shoreline protection structure\" means a coastal infrastructure design made of durable materials, such as rock and reinforced concrete, including seawalls, bulkheads, rip rap, groins, revetments, breakwaters and similar shoreline stabilization methods, built to protect the coast from erosion and flooding.\n      b. The mayor shall designate an agency to conduct a study of the entire shoreline of the city of New York. The study shall examine, at minimum: \n      1. Whether any existing shoreline protection structures are intact, degrading or deteriorated;\n      2. Any maintenance needed to an existing shoreline protection structure or whether such shoreline protection structure should be replaced; \n      3. Where such shoreline protection structure should be replaced, whether a living shoreline technique would be a feasible replacement, or if a living shoreline technique is not a feasible replacement, whether environmental concrete would be feasible; \n      4. Where no shoreline protection structure is present, whether a shoreline protection structure is necessary, and, if so, whether a living shoreline technique or environmental concrete would be feasible.\n       c. No later than one year after the effective date of this local law, the designated agency shall post on its website and submit to the mayor and speaker of the council a report that contains its findings and recommendations based on the study pursuant to subdivision b of this section.  \n      � 2. This local law takes effect immediately, and expires and is deemed repealed upon final submission of the report as required by section one of this local law.\n\n\nJSA\nLS #11009\n4/7/2021\n\n\n      1\n      \n      \n      2",
