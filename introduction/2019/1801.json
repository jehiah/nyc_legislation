  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Education (“DOE”) to report certain information on its website. The bill would require DOE to ensure that the search engine on its website is designed to find certain reports when one or more keywords relating to the report’s subject matter are entered. It would also require DOE to ensure that such reports are easily understandable by the general public, and that all publicly accessible information on its website remains publicly accessible. This bill would also require DOE to post on its website and file with the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council a report about functioning and non-functioning hyperlinks on its website, as well as documents available through its website before and after it was redesigned. DOE would also be required to repair or redirect any non-functioning hyperlinks and repost documents that were available before the website was redesigned. This bill would also require DOE to submit to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council, as well as post on its website, a report regarding feedback it has received from the public about its website, and provide an explanation regarding what changes it has made or plans to make in response to such feedback.",
