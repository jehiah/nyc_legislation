  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Investigation (DOI) and the Special Commissioner of Investigation for the New York City School District (SCI) to develop and maintain web applications providing information on City agencies’ compliance with DOI’s and SCI’s investigatory recommendations. Each web application would contain information on: each recommendation sent to a City agency resulting from an investigation; whether that recommendation was accepted or rejected by the City agency; and if accepted, whether the City agency implemented the recommendation. Both web applications would have to be made available online by July 1, 2020.",
