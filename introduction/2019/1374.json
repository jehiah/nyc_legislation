  "Summary": "The proposed local law pertains solely to the management of the City automated meter reading program. The Automated Meter Reading program is almost completely installed although there are still some properties paying frontage bills. Whenever a new meter is installed, there is a chance that water bills may increase.  This local law will assist the Department by making customers aware of water waste and leaks and enabling them to conserve and monitor their water usage.",
