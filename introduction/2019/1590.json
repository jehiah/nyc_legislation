I now understand that they want to contact the defense lawyer to put the onus on the lawyer to get a HIPAA signed. I think that's wrong and only adds a layer of bureaucracy to a statute that is trying to streamline information sharing. We want CHS to obtain consent, and it's much easier for them to physically get it directly. If clients don't give it to CHS, the lawyers can try to get it. Our version is much cleaner leg and better policy, I think.  \n      2\n      \n      \n      1\n      \n      \n","RTF":"{\\rtf1\\fbidis\\ansi\\ansicpg1252\\deff0\\deflang1033\\deflangfe1033{\\fonttbl{\\f0\\froman\\fprq2\\fcharset0 Times New Roman;}}\n{\\colortbl ;\\red0\\green0\\blue0;}\n\\viewkind4\\uc1\\pard\\ltrpar\\qc\\f0\\fs24 Int.
