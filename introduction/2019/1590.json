The term [\"inmate\"] incarcerated individual means any person in the custody of the New York city department of correction.\n      ï¿½ 2. The section heading of section 17-1803 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 124 for the year 2016, is amended to read as follows:\n      ï¿½ 17-1803 [Inmate health] Health information from screening for incarcerated individuals. \n      ï¿½ 3.

Short title. This section shall be known as and may be cited as \"The Get Well and Get Out Act\". \n      b. Information sharing with attorneys of individuals diagnosed with serious mental illness in the custody of the department of correction. For each incarcerated individual who is not sentenced and who is diagnosed with a serious mental illness, correctional health services shall seek voluntary consent from such individual to share medical information with the attorney of record of such individual within 48 hours of their diagnosis, and provide such information created or obtained pursuant to sections 17-1802 and 17-1804 to the attorney of record for any such individual within five calendar days of obtaining consent from the individual. [??1]Correctional health services shall make a good faith effort to ascertain such individual's attorney of record, including but not limited to consulting the website maintained by the New York state unified court system, speaking with the individual, contacting the clerk of the court, or any other reasonable means necessary to identify such individual's attorney.\n      c. Confidential medical condition letter. Within five business days prior to any court date indicated by the New York city department of correction's inmate information system, correctional health services shall provide a confidential medical condition letter to the attorney of record for any incarcerated individual to whom subdivision a of this section applies, as permitted by law. Such letter shall include the following information for each such individual:\n      1. The psychiatric diagnosis.\n      2.

I now understand that they want to contact the defense lawyer to put the onus on the lawyer to get a HIPAA signed. I think that's wrong and only adds a layer of bureaucracy to a statute that is trying to streamline information sharing. We want CHS to obtain consent, and it's much easier for them to physically get it directly. If clients don't give it to CHS, the lawyers can try to get it. Our version is much cleaner leg and better policy, I think.  \n      2\n      \n      \n      1",
