  "Summary": "This bill would require DOE to expand its current student demographic data reporting to the grade level to provide more granular data. The bill also requires DOE to report on a side-by-side comparison of the racial and ethnic demographics of each school or special program with the racial and ethnic demographics of the larger attendance zone and community school district. This will make the existing reporting requirement more robust and allow the Council, advocates and others to drill down deeper into the segregation that exists in our schools and the Department’s efforts to remedy that.",
