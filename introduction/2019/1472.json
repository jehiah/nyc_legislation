  "Summary": "This bill would require the department of finance to collect data and establish a public dataset of commercial properties in the City. Such dataset would contain the following data disaggregated by council district and census tract: the median and average total duration of leases; the median and average remaining term to lease expiration; the median and average size of rentable floor area per premises lease; the number of such premises reported as being leased and vacant; the median and average rent; and the number of such premises whose lease is due to expire within two years of June 1 of the current calendar year. The bill would further require the release of a list of addresses of commercial properties, and whether or not those properties are vacant.  The owners of a ground floor or second floor commercial premises would be required to submit this information to the department of finance as a part of the annual income and expense statement submission. Supplemental registrations are required if the premises become vacant or the ownership of the premises has changed.",
