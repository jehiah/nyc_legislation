The proposed local lawbill prohibits storage of biodiesel blends of greater than twenty percent when underground storage tank components are not compatible with the substance stored.  The legislation identifies system parts critical for demonstrating compatibility, requires that owners or operators of underground storage tanks use components that are certified by a nationally recognized independent testing laboratory or use components approved by the manufacturer or another implementing agency determined to be adequately protective of public health and the environment.  The proposed local law legislation permits the Fire Department to issue a citywide waiver where biodiesel blends of 20% biodiesel or less are stored in city-owned underground storage tanks.  The local law also authorizes the Fire Department to issue a variance where biodiesel blends greater than 20% biodiesel are stored in city-owned underground storage tanks provided that the standards for granting the variance establish that the storage method is adequately protective of public health and the environment. Finally, owners or operators of underground storage tank systems must keep records of leak detection performance claims for a period of at least five years and  owners or operators of underground storage tank systems must keep records that document compliance with the compatibility requirement for as long as the underground storage tank is used to store biodiesel blends.","LastModified":"2021-04-28T18:39:40.75Z"}

A Commissioner would head the new department. The Commissioner would be responsible for all matters relating to resiliency of critical infrastructure, the built environment, coastal protection and coastal communities and climate change.  The commissioner would also be responsible for all matters pertaining to recovery and resiliency and sustainability. The commissioner would have the power to develop and coordinate the implementation of policies, programs and actions to meet the long-term needs of the city, to develop measurable sustainability indicators and to take actions to increase public awareness and education regarding sustainability and climate change.  The proposed legislation also creates a sustainability advisory board with representatives from the environmental, environmental justice, planning, architecture, engineering, oceanography, coastal protection, construction, critical infrastructure, labor, business and academic sectors. The legislation requires reporting on existing or revised sustainability indicators and population projections.  The Commissioner will be required to develop and coordinate the implementation of a   comprehensive, long-term sustainability plan for the city for a period of at least 30 years. The plan is required to set milestones, interim and long-term goals, to be updated every four years and to include annual reports on the city’s progress in improving the sustainability indicators.  Finally, the legislation creates interagency green team to pilot and facilitate the use of innovative technologies, design and construction techniques, materials or products that may have significant environmental and sustainability benefits and to assist innovative projects in addressing local regulatory requirements.","LastModified":"2021-04-28T18:41:06.477Z"}

This bill further requires building owners to notify both the building tenants and HPD when buildings are ready for reoccupancy. Finally, this bill penalizes building owners who permit tenants to move into buildings with vacate orders before the buildings may legally be reoccupied.","LastModified":"2020-03-30T16:09:29.6Z"}

The mayor or their designee would appoint advisory committee members from various fields, including City government, healthcare, and non-profit organizations, among others. The advisory committee would be required to meet a minimum of two times per year for two years, after which time ENDGBV would assess the continued need for such advisory committee.
