  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Homeless Services (DHS), to develop a plan to accommodate pets of homeless individuals and families with the objective of allowing homeless pet-owners to keep their pets. Such plan would include, for example, the steps DHS can take to prioritize the acquisition of facilities that will permit homeless pet-owners to keep their pets, as well as identifying existing providers that will permit homeless pet-owners to keep their pets.  The bill would also require that DHS submit the plan to the Speaker of the Council no later than 180 days of the effective date of this bill. The bill would also require that DHS collaborate with the Department of Social Services (DSS) to outline steps to address accommodating pets of homeless individuals and families in shelter under DSS programs such as those in shelters for domestic violence survivors.",
