[The board, or by written designation, a member of the board or the executive director, may conduct hearings, or study or investigate any matter within the jurisdiction of the department, and the board may make recommendations and submit reports of its findings to the appropriate authorities.] Starting July 1, 2021, the board shall issue a report, at least every three years, on issues related to the department's grievance process. Such report shall incorporate direct feedback from incarcerated individuals and proposed recommendations for relevant improvements, and shall include a section of recommendations on how to improve the grievance process for vulnerable populations, including incarcerated individuals who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, and gender nonconforming. Such report shall be submitted to the council and posted on the board's website.\n      � 2. Section 626 of the New York city charter is amended by adding a new subdivision h to read as follows: \n      h.
