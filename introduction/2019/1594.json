  "Summary": "This bill would increase the dollar threshold, from $1,000 to $100,000, for determining whether liens from Department of Housing Preservation and Development repair expenses qualify a property for inclusion in the Third Party Transfer process. This bill would also remove the prohibition on the Department of Finance recommending properties smaller than a full tax block for inclusion on the list of delinquent taxes.",
