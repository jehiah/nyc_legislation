Definitions. For the purposes of this local law, the following terms have the following meanings: \n      Intersex traits or variations in sex characteristics. The term \"intersex traits or variations in sex characteristics\" means the umbrella term for differences in reproductive or sex anatomy that may appear in an individual's chromosomes, genitals, secondary sex characteristics, or internal organs such as testes or ovaries, and may be identified at birth, or may not be discovered until puberty or later in life.  \n      Medically unnecessary. The term \"medically unnecessary\" means a treatment or intervention on the sex characteristics of an individual born with intersex traits or variations in sex characteristics that may be safely deferred until that individual can provide informed consent. For purposes of this section, psychological factors do not constitute medical necessity for a treatment or intervention on the sex characteristics of an individual born with intersex traits or variations in sex characteristics until and unless the individual has themselves identified psychological factors as relevant to decision-making.  \n      b.
