  "Summary": "This bill would require the Police Department (NYPD) to evaluate at least 50 sites a week for a period of six months for illegal parking. The sites would be selected based on a review of complaints and summonses relating to the misuse of parking permits and obstruction of a bicycle lane, bus lane, sidewalk, crosswalk, or fire hydrant by a vehicle, as well as traffic crashes and moving violations. The evaluations would include photographic documentation of vehicles parked at the site and a list of enforcement actions. This information would be submitted the Council, the Mayor, and the Department of Investigation (DOI).  By September 30, 2020, DOI would conduct an investigation and publish a report on the issuance of parking permits and enforcement of parking laws, including an analysis of the information submitted by NYPD.",
