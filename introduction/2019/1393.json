  "Summary": "This bill would require the Police Department (NYPD) to evaluate at least 50 sites a week for a period of six months for illegal parking. The sites would be selected based on a review of complaints and summonses relating to the misuse of parking permits and obstruction of a bicycle lane, bus lane, sidewalk, crosswalk, or fire hydrant by a vehicle, as well as traffic crashes and moving violations. The evaluations would include photographic documentation of vehicles parked at the site and a list of enforcement actions. This information would be submitted the Council, the Mayor, and the Department of Investigation (DOI).  By September 30, 2020, DOI would conduct an investigation and publish a report on the issuance of parking permits and enforcement of parking laws, including an analysis of the information submitted by NYPD.",

In selecting such locations, the police department shall consider the following information from the previous six months: \n      (a) 311 complaints relating to the improper use of a parking permit; \n      (b) 311 complaints relating to the obstruction of a bicycle lane, bus lane, sidewalk, crosswalk, or fire hydrant by a vehicle; \n      (c) complaints received by the police department in relation to the improper use of a parking permit; \n      (d) complaints received by the police department in relation to obstruction of a bicycle lane, bus lane, sidewalk, crosswalk, or fire hydrant by a vehicle; \n      (e) summonses issued by the police department in relation to the improper use of a parking permit;\n      (f) summonses issued by the police department in relation to obstruction of a bicycle lane, bus lane, sidewalk, crosswalk, or fire hydrant by a vehicle;\n      (g) traffic crashes involving a fatality or serious injury; and \n      (h) moving violations issued by the police department. \n      2. Each evaluation conducted pursuant to this section shall include a description of each such block or intersection and why it was selected for evaluation; the number of complaints, summonses, traffic crashes, and moving violations associated with such block or intersection; the times at which such violations historically occur; photographs of all vehicles parked in such location demonstrating vehicles parked both legally and illegally; and for any vehicle parked illegally, a photograph of any city-issued parking permit or other parking permit displayed in each such vehicle, a photograph of the license plate of each such vehicle, and a summary of enforcement actions taken regarding each such vehicle and, if an enforcement action is not taken regarding each such vehicle, the reasons why. \n      b. No later than 30 days following the end of each month in which the police department conducts evaluations pursuant to subdivision a of this section, the police department shall submit a report identifying the blocks or intersections evaluated, the analyses and determinations made pursuant to paragraph 2 of subdivision a of this section, the department's response to such evaluation, including actions taken, if any.
