  "Summary": "This bill would codify the mayoral school diversity advisory group. Established in 2017, this advisory group was tasked with “working to reshape citywide policies and practices such as admissions and program planning.” The advisory group would be made up of Council appointments, a public advocate appointment, and mayoral appointments.  The advisory group would be tasked with examining factors as they relate to school diversity and would be required on an annual basis to provide a public report to the Mayor, the Speaker and The Public Advocate on increasing diversity in all schools. The annual report will also require a multi-year plan to be developed that can be adopted by DOE to address integration in schools. The report will also require a one-year look back measurement to track measurement of goals achieved.",
