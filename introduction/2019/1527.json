  "Summary": "This bill would require certain covered retail vendors who sell certain products subject to New York State sales tax to charge a fee of 5 cents for each paper bag provided to a customer of such vendor.  This bill would have the City opt into State law that goes into effect on March 1, 2020. It would also exempt residents who use the supplemental nutrition assistance program, special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants and children, as full or partial payment toward the items purchased in a covered store from paying the bag fee.",
