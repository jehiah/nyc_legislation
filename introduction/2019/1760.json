  "Summary": "This bill would require owners of multiple dwellings that utilize keyless entry systems, including but not limited to key fobs, biometric identifiers and electronic technologies, to provide tenants with a data retention and privacy policy. This bill would establish restrictions on the collection and use of data collected from such systems and from tenants’ usage of utilities and internet services, including, among other things, requiring consent from tenants and other users to use such information, restricting the sharing of such information with third parties, and requiring that any data collected be removed, anonymized, or destroyed within a given time. This bill would establish a private right of action for the unlawful sale of data collected through a keyless entry system covered by the bill. The Department of Housing Preservation and Development would be required to inform tenants and owners of multiple dwellings about the provisions of this law.",

Reference data for any tenant who has permanently vacated a smart access building shall be removed, or anonymized where removal of such data would render the smart access system inoperable, from the smart access system no later than 90 days after such tenant has permanently vacated such building. Reference data for any user that has been granted access to such tenant's dwelling unit and is not a tenant of such smart access building shall be removed, or anonymized where removal of such data would render the smart access system inoperable, from the smart access system no later than 90 days after access expires. Reference data for any user who has withdrawn authorization from an owner or third party who had previously been given access to such reference data pursuant to subdivision a shall be removed, or anonymized where removal of such data would render the smart access system inoperable, from the smart access system no later than 90 days after such authorization has been withdrawn. The same time frame shall apply when a tenant withdraws a request that a guest be granted access to such tenant's dwelling unit via the smart access system, if such guest is not also a tenant of such smart access building.\n      d. Reference data collected solely for the operation of such smart access system for a tenant who has permanently vacated a smart access building shall be destroyed no later than 90 days after a tenant has permanently vacated a smart access building or has withdrawn authorization from the owner of such smart access building or a third party.

A smart access system must implement stringent security measures and safeguards to protect the security and data of tenants, guests and other individuals in smart access buildings. Such security measures and safeguards must, at a minimum, include data encryption, the ability of the user to change the password if the system uses a password and firmware that is regularly updated to enable the remediation of any security or vulnerability issues.\n      � 26-3006 Private right of action. a. A lawful occupant of a dwelling unit, or a group of such occupants, in a smart access building may bring an action alleging an unlawful sale of data in violation of paragraph one of subdivision a of section 26-3003 in any court of competent jurisdiction. If such court finds that a person is in violation of such paragraph for the unlawful sale of data, such court shall, in addition to any other relief such court determines to be appropriate:\n      1. Award to each such occupant per each unlawful sale of such occupant's data: (i) compensatory damages and, in such court's discretion, punitive damages, or (ii) at the election of each occupant, damages ranging from $200 to $1,000; and\n      2. Award to such occupants reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs.\n      b. Nothing in this section shall relieve any such occupant or occupants from any obligation to pay rent or any other charge for which such occupant or occupants are otherwise liable to a person found to be in violation of this chapter. Nothing in this section shall affect any other right or responsibility of an occupant or owner afforded to such person pursuant to a lawful lease.\n      c.
