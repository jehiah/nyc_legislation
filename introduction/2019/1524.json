Upon submitting an application for a waiver, the agency requesting the waiver shall notify by email the president of the borough in which pesticides may be applied pursuant to such waiver, the council member in whose district pesticides may be applied pursuant to such waiver, and the community board for the community district in which pesticides may be applied pursuant to such waiver, and publish notification of such waiver ?request in the City Record. In determining whether to grant or deny a request for a waiver, the commissioner shall consider whether the application of 17-1203 would be, in the absence of the waiver, unreasonable with respect to (i) the magnitude of the infestation, (ii) the threat to public health, (iii) the availability of effective alternatives and (iv) the likelihood of exposure of humans to the pesticide. Such waiver may be issued with respect to one or multiple applications and may be granted for a term deemed appropriate by the commissioner, provided, however, that such term shall not exceed one year.

This local law takes effect immediately, provided that the prohibition on use of any pesticide the use of which was not prohibited prior to the enactment of this local law shall take effect 180 days after the effective date.\n\n\nKS/SIL/HA \nLS #2219/Int. 800/2015\nLS 229 \n4/14/2021 11:00 pm\n1",
