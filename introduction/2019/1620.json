Chapter 24 of the New York city administrative code is amended by adding a new section 24-808 to read as follows:\n      � 24-808 Comprehensive plan for the entire shoreline.  a. Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings:\n      Hard and soft stabilization methods. The term \"hard and soft stabilization methods\" means rip rap, groins, breakwaters, levees, floodwalls, marshes, erosion control, beach nourishment and restoration, non-structural living shoreline options, and any similar stabilization methods.\n      Structural and non-structural risk reduction approaches.
