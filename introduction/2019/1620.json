  "Summary": "This bill would require that no later than September 30, 2022, and every ten years thereafter, the Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability, or another office or agency designated by OLTPS, in consultation with other City agencies, develop and post on its website a climate adaptation plan that considers and evaluates various climate hazards impacting the City and its shoreline.  Such climate hazards would include extreme storms, sea level rise, tidal flooding, extreme heat, extreme precipitation, extreme wind, wild fire, and flooding surge events associated with a storm.  The climate adaptation plan would include recommendations for resiliency and adaptation measures to protect residents, property and infrastructure in the City.  Such plan would identify areas that are highly vulnerable to climate hazards to help determine where resiliency and adaptation measures should first be implemented.  Such plan would also consider the potential impact on environmental justice areas.",
