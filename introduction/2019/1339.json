  "Summary": "This bill would require the New York City Department of Social Services (DSS) to arrange for the provision of a written notice to CityFHEPS rental assistance program applicants with administration about source of income discrimination at the time an applicant receives a shopping letter from DSS. The notice would provide information about protections under the New York City Human Rights Law related to discrimination on the basis of a person’s lawful source of income.",
