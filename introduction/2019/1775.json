  "Summary": "This bill would prohibit food service establishments, couriers who deliver food, and food delivery platforms from providing eating utensils, extra eating containers, condiment packets and napkins to customers for take-out and delivery orders unless the customer requests them. Delivery platforms would have to provide a means for a customer to request the items, but the bill would require that the default option is that the customer does not request such items. Food service establishments, couriers and delivery platforms who violate this bill would be subject to civil penalties, however the bill would require that warnings, instead of a monetary penalty, be given for any violation occurring before July 1, 2023.",
