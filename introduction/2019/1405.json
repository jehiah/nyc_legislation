  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to establish a food protection course and certification program for restaurants to demonstrate compliance with food allergen safety, and require restaurants to post a sign for customers on food allergen awareness. The bill would also establish a voluntary certification program for food service establishments who advertise themselves as capable of accommodating certain dietary restrictions, such as gluten-free, nut-free, vegetarian, and vegan, among others.",

Such advertisement or publication may be immediately preceded by the notation \"Certified,\" followed by such particular dietary restriction for which a food service establishment has been certified.

The certification card shall not be defaced, marred, camouflaged or hidden from public view.  \n\tf. A food service establishment that has received certification shall be re-certified as part of its periodic health inspections conducted by the department pursuant to section 81.51 of title 4 of the New York city health code. \n\tg. Failure to comply with provisions of this section shall constitute a violation punishable by a civil penalty in the amount of not less $250 and not more than $500 for the first violation, not less than $500 and not more than $750 for the second violation occurring within one year, and not less than $750 and not more than $1,000 for the third and each subsequent violation occurring within one year.\n\th. The commissioner may charge a food service establishment electing to participate in the certification program a reasonable fee to defray all or part of the costs incurred by the department for registration, training, testing and certificate issuance.\n\ti. The commissioner shall maintain a database, to be made available on the department's website, of all food service establishments that have been certified as compliant with particular dietary restrictions, specifying the dietary restriction certificates that such establishments have received.\n\t� 3.
