  "Summary": "Due to a slow procurement process, many entities that enter into contracts with city agencies begin to provide services before the agency can pay them. This can make it difficult for contractors, particularly non-profit contractors, to cover their expenses. This bill would require interest to be paid on late payments under city contracts with non-profit organizations. The non-profit contractor would not be eligible to receive the interest if the non-profit contractor has received a no-interest and no-service-fee loan issued or authorized by a city agency to cover its expenses in relation to the subject contract.",

The applicable interest rate for such interest payments shall be the rate set by the commissioner of taxation and finance for corporate taxes pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection (e) of section 1096 of the tax law.\n      d. If any interest payment required pursuant to this section is made from amounts appropriated for program purposes such that it reduces the amount available to be spent on the program, the contracting agency shall notify the council in writing of the amount of such reduction and the reason why other funding could not be used for such interest payment.\n      e.
