  "Summary": "This bill would amend City Charter provisions that govern vacancies in the Public Advocate, Borough President, Comptroller and Council Member positions. Usually, vacancies must be filled at the general election every November, even if a special election was held earlier to fill the position on an interim basis. This bill would require that vacancies be filled by special election, rather than general election, and allow the person elected to finish the predecessor’s term. As with all special elections, these would be nonpartisan—that is, without the party-nominating process.",
