  "Text": "Int. No. 1581\n\nBy Council Members Vallone and Dromm\n\n..Title\nA Local Law in relation to a study on solar-powered traffic control devices\n..Body\n\nBe it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Solar-powered traffic control devices study. a. Definitions. For purposes of this local law, the following terms have the following meanings: \n      Solar-powered traffic control device. The term \"solar-powered traffic control device\" means any solar-powered traffic control device or traffic-control signal.\n      Traffic control device. The term \"traffic control device\" means a sign, signal, marking or device not inconsistent with the vehicle and traffic law that is placed or erected by authority of a public body or official having jurisdiction for the purpose of regulating, warning or guiding traffic. \n      Traffic-control signal. The term \"traffic-control signal\" means a device, whether manually, electrically or mechanically operated, by which traffic is alternately directed to stop and permitted to proceed.\n      b. The department shall conduct a study to make findings and recommendations regarding the feasibility of using solar-powered traffic control devices on city streets. Such study shall examine, at minimum, the utility of solar-powered traffic control devices, including a comparison of their effectiveness in deterring violations of vehicle and traffic laws, rules and regulations with the effectiveness of traffic control devices and traffic-control signals that are not solar-powered in deterring the same, and shall identify any logistical challenges in siting such devices. The department shall post on its website and submit to the speaker of the council a report of such study that contains its findings and recommendations no later than one year after the effective date of this local law.\n      ï¿½ 2.
