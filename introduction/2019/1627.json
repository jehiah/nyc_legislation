  "Summary": "This bill would require the procurement policy board (“PPB”) to set time limits within which agencies would be required to complete each step of the procurement process. The mayor’s office of contract services (“MOCS”) would be required to (1) assess whether each agency is complying with the time limits set by the PPB; (2) assess the difference between the time limits and the actual time required for each step of the procurement process; and (3) recommend changes to the time limits set by the PPB. MOCS would provide a report to the PPB, the Mayor and the Council and would post the report on its website. The PPB would be required to reevaluate and revise the timeframe goals based on the MOCS report. This bill would also require MOCS to develop an online platform that can be used for tracking contracts from the bid award to registration. The online platform would be publically available.",
