The term \"long-acting reversible contraception\" means one or more reversible contraceptive methods, used separately or in combination, including, but not limited to, intrauterine devices, injections or injectable, or subdermal contraceptive implants, to be administered to or self-administered by a patient in a dosage and manner intended to prevent pregnancy for an extended period of time without user action when dispensed in accordance with medically professional standards of practice, and which has been found safe and effective for such use by the United States food and drug administration.\n      b. Availability of contraception.
