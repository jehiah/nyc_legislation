  "Summary": "The Department of Housing Preservation and Development (“HPD”) requires potential housing developers to submit a Compliance Package as part of HPD’s integrity review process. This process, which includes a series of review and background checks, is intended to verify the integrity and competence of individuals and entities seeking to do business with HPD. The proposed legislation would require HPD, within 45 days of selecting a developer for a housing development project receiving City financial assistance, to submit to the Council copies of all Compliance Packages filed with HPD in connection with the housing development project.",
