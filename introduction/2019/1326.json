  "Summary": "This bill would require that chain restaurants in New York City post warning notices next to menu items and on signs for items that contain over 12 grams of added sugar. The Department of Health and Mental Hygiene would be required to craft an added sugar icon and a warning statement on the consequences of consuming added sugars which would then be added to restaurant menus and signs. Additionally, the proposed bill would impose monetary penalties on restaurants that violate this law.",
