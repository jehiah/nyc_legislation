  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to issue a rule designating an icon to be displayed in a clear and conspicuous manner on (i) menus or menu boards adjacent to the listed prepackaged food items and (ii) prepackaged food items on display, that exceed a specified level of added sugars, including, but not limited to, 100 percent or more of the daily value for added sugars. Such rule would also provide a factual warning statement about high added sugars intake. No later than 1 year after the issuance of such rule, chain restaurants (those with 15 or more restaurants) in New York City must post such icon on or next to a prepackaged food item on display, or next to a prepackaged food item listed on the menu or menu board, and post such warning statement at the point of purchase. Failure to do so would result in financial penalties of $200-500.  Finally, this bill would require DOHMH to conduct public outreach to educate restaurants about the requirements of this local law.",
