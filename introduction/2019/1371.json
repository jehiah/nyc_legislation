The credit, as expanded, would provide complete tax relief for taxpayers who have incomes of $5 million or less and who pay less than $750,000 per year in rent. Taxpayers who have incomes of $5 million or less and who pay between $750,000 and $800,000 per year in rent, and those taxpayers who have incomes between $5 million and $10 million and who pay less than $800,000 per year in rent would receive a partial, sliding scale credit. Taxpayers who have incomes of more than $10 million or who pay more than $800,000 per year in rent would not receive any credit. The expanded credit would be available beginning June 1, 2019.","TextID":63522,"Text":"Int. No. 1371\n \nBy Council Members Powers, R.
