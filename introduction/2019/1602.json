  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Transparent billing software task force. a. For purposes of this local law, the following terms have the following meanings:\n      City. The term \"city\" means the city of New York.\n      Transparent billing software. The term \"transparent billing software\" means software designed to permit the user to verify the accuracy of time billed for work performed on a computer, whether through keystroke and mouse event tracking, screenshots or other functions that have an auditing purpose.\n      b. There shall be a task force to study the feasibility of using transparent billing software to verify the accuracy of time billed for work performed on computers pursuant to public contracts. \n      c. 1. The task force shall consist of the following members:\n      (a) The director of the mayor's office of contract services, or such director's designee; \n      (b) Three members appointed by the mayor;\n      (c) One member appointed by the speaker of the council; and\n      (d) One member appointed by the comptroller.\n      2. The mayor shall appoint a chair from among the members of the task force. No member of the task force shall be removed except by the appointing authority for cause. In the event of a vacancy on the task force, a successor shall be selected by the original appointing authority.\n      d. The task force shall meet no less than once a quarter and shall permit public access to at least one meeting.\n      e. The task force shall submit a report of findings and any recommendations for legislation or policy to the mayor and the speaker of the council no later than 12 months after the effective date of this local law. In formulating its findings and recommendations, the task force shall consider the following:\n      1. The potential of transparent billing software to improve the ability of city agencies to evaluate and monitor work performed on computers pursuant to public contracts, including the potential of such software to enhance the ability of city agencies to detect and protect against fraudulent billing;\n      2. Methods to acquire transparent billing software, including the development of such software to address the particular needs of city agencies;\n      3. Methods to implement the use of transparent billing software by city agencies, including implementation of such software on a citywide or case-by-case basis among city agencies;\n      4. Whether such software may be issued to contractors or subcontractors at no cost to such contractors or subcontractors, and the anti-competitive effect on the bidding process, if any, of requiring contractors and subcontractors to comply with monitoring and evaluation conducted with transparent billing software;\n      5. Estimated costs associated with the implementation of such software, including estimates for the cost of labor to acquire or develop such software and to implement it as an ongoing evaluation and monitoring tool, and a comparison of such costs against a projection of public funds that could be saved if such software were implemented; and\n      6. Any barriers to the implementation of transparent billing software.\n      f. The task force may consult with experts to prepare the report required by subdivision e of this section.\n      � 2. This local law takes effect immediately, and all appointments required by this local law shall be made no later than 60 days after such effective date. This local law expires and is deemed repealed 2 years after such effective date.  \n\nNC\nLS #10513\n5/21/19\n\n\n3\n      \n      \n      1",
