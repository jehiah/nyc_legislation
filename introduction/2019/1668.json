  "Summary": "The proposed legislation would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene or another agency or entity so designated by the Mayor to develop and manage a primary care services and patient navigation program (PCSPNP), which provides primary care services and applicable patient navigator services. Such services will be offered by medical service providers, including Health and Hospitals (H+H) facilities, federally qualified health centers (FQHC), and other not-for-profit and private medical service providers. PCSPNP must ensure that that primary care services are provided in each community district and that at least one participating acute care hospital providing specialty services is provided in each borough, and shall also offer a telemedicine service providing access for patients 24 hours per day, seven days per week.",
