  "Summary": "This bill would expand upon Local Law 103 of 2017, which currently only requires a property owner applying for a variance or special permit to provide testimony to the BSA under oath.  Instead, this bill would amend the Charter to require that property owners providing testimony at all BSA hearings now do so under oath.",
