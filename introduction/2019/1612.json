  "Summary": "This bill would expand the New York City Human Rights Law’s protections against discrimination in housing accommodations by eliminating an exception for owner-occupied rentals. The bill would prohibit landlords of such rentals from discriminating against potential renters on the basis of race, creed, color, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, uniformed services, marital status, partnership status, alienage or citizenship status, or because of any lawful source of income of such person or persons.",
