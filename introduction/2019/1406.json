  "Summary": "Proposed Int. No. 1406-A would require the New York City Department of Education to annually report on several indicators regarding its evaluation of preschool-age children for special education services and the provision of such services. Those indicators would cover the initial referral for evaluation at the beginning of the process to the provision of such services and reporting on how many students eligible to receive such services actually receiving them, in full and partial. The bill also requires the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to annually report on several indicators regarding its provision of early intervention services to eligible children ages zero to three.",
