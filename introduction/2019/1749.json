  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR) to restrict the removal or destruction of certain types of trees on public and private property.  It would prohibit any person or entity from removing a heritage tree (a tree with a trunk circumference that is 100 inches or more) or a special tree (a tree with a trunk circumference between 55 inches and 99 inches) without first having obtained a permit from DPR.  A heritage tree would only be allowed to be removed if such tree posed a danger to public safety or is diseased and dying.",
