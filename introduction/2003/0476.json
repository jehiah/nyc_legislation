Provided, however, that the total tax prior to the application of any tax credits shall not exceed the highest rate of tax set forth in the tax table in subdivision (g) of this section multiplied by the taxpayer's taxable income.\n            (C)  This paragraph shall only apply to taxable years beginning after two thousand two and before two thousand six.\n            ï¿½ 3.
