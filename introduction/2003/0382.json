  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n      Section 1.  Declaration of legislative intent and findings.\n      The council finds that amendments to the New York City Campaign Finance Act and the charter of the city of New York will further the goals of this landmark legislation.  By, among other things, lowering contribution limits, prohibiting the acceptance of contributions from organizations, enhancing the formula for paying public funds to participants facing high spending non-participants, adjusting the expenditure limits, and improving key elements of the Debate Program, this local law will further reduce the opportunity for wealthy special interests to exercise or appear to exercise undue influence over local elected officials and will encourage greater candidate participation in a reform program that has been recognized as a national model.  This local law also will adjust the treatment of exempt expenditures to simplify candidate participation and compliance.\n      � 2.  Subdivision 12 of section 3-702 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\n      12.  The term \"intermediary\" shall mean an individual, corporation, partnership, political committee, employee organization or other entity which, other than in the regular course of business as a postal, delivery or messenger service, delivers any contribution from another person or entity to a candidate or authorized committee, including those who are known to the candidate or authorized committee to have successfully solicited contributions to the candidate or authorized committee.  \"Intermediary\" shall not include spouses, domestic partners, parents, children or siblings of the person making such contribution, or any fundraising agent, as such term is defined in the rules of the board.\n      � 3.  Paragraphs (f), (i), and (j) of subdivision 1 of section 3-703 of the administrative code of the city of New York are amended to read as follows, and paragraphs (k) and (l) are deleted as follows:\n      (f)  not accept and his or her principal committee must not accept, either directly or by transfer, any contribution or contributions (i) from any one individual[, partnership, political committee, employee organization or other entity] for all covered elections held in the same calendar year in which he or she is a participating candidate which in the aggregate[: (i)] (A) for the office of mayor, public advocate or comptroller shall exceed four thousand [five hundred] dollars, [or (ii)] (B) for borough president, shall exceed three thousand [five hundred] dollars, or [(iii)] (C) for member of the city council, shall exceed two thousand [five hundred] dollars, or (ii) from a corporation, partnership, employee organization, political committee, or other entity; provided that a candidate and his or her principal committee may accept additional contributions which do not exceed one half the amount of the applicable limitation for any run-off primary election, additional day for voting held pursuant to section 3-108 of the New York state election law, special election to fill a vacancy, run-off special election to fill a vacancy, delayed or otherwise postponed election, or election held pursuant to court order which is a covered election and in which the candidate seeks nomination for election or election; and provided further that if state law prescribes a contribution limitation of a lesser amount, this paragraph shall not be deemed to authorize acceptance of a contribution in excess of such lesser amount.  The maximum contributions set forth in this paragraph shall be adjusted in accordance with subdivision seven of this section;\n      (i)  not make and his or her principal committee must not make expenditures which in the aggregate exceed the applicable expenditure limitations set forth in section 3-706; and\n      (j)  meet the threshold for eligibility set forth in subdivision two of this section[;].\n      [(k)  not accept and his or her principal committee must not accept, either directly or by transfer, any contribution, loan, guarantee, or other security for such loan from any political committee for all covered elections held in the same calendar year in which he or she is a participating candidate, except as is otherwise provided for contributions by political committees pursuant to section 3-707 of this chapter; and\n      (l)  not accept and his or her principal committee must not accept, either directly or by transfer, any contribution, loan, guarantee, or other security for such loan from any corporation, other than a corporation that is a political committee as defined in subdivision eleven of section 3-702 of this chapter, for all covered elections held in the same calendar year in which he or she is a participating candidate.]\n\t� 4.  Subdivisions 2, 5, 6, and 11 of section 3-703 of the administrative code of the city of New York are amended to read as follows:\n\t2. (a)  The threshold for eligibility for public funding for participating candidates in a primary or general election, or special election to fill a vacancy, shall be in the case of:\n      (i)  mayor, not less than two hundred fifty thousand dollars in matchable contributions comprised of sums of up to one thousand dollars per contributor including at least one thousand matchable contributions of ten dollars or more;\n      (ii)  public advocate and comptroller, not less than one hundred twenty-five thousand dollars in matchable contributions comprised of sums of up to one thousand dollars per contributor including at least five hundred matchable contributions of ten dollars or more;\n      (iii)  borough president, an amount equal to the number of persons living in such borough as determined by the last census multiplied by two cents in matchable contributions comprised of sums of up to one thousand dollars per contributor including at least one hundred matchable contributions of ten dollars or more from residents of the borough, or ten thousand dollars comprised of sums of up to one thousand dollars per contributor, whichever is greater;\n      (iv)  member of the city council, not less than five thousand dollars in matchable contributions comprised of sums of up to one thousand dollars per contributor including at least [fifty] one hundred matchable contributions of ten dollars or more from residents of the district in which the seat is to be filled, except that in regularly scheduled city council elections held in the year two thousand three at least [seventy-five] one hundred matchable contributions of ten dollars or more shall be required from residents of the borough or boroughs in which such council district is located.\n      (b) Any participating candidate meeting the threshold for eligibility in a primary election for one of the foregoing offices shall be deemed to have met the threshold for eligibility for such office in any other election, other than a special election to fill a vacancy, held in the same calendar year.\n      5.  Participating candidates who are seeking nomination or election exclusively as write-in candidates, who are unopposed in a covered election, or who are opposed in a covered election only by candidates seeking nomination or election exclusively as write-in candidates, shall not be eligible to receive public funds for such election.\n      6. (a)  Each principal committee shall report to the board every contribution, loan, guarantee, or other security for such loan received by the candidate and such principal committee, the full name, residential address, occupation, employer, and business address of each [individual, corporation, partnership, political committee, employee organization or other entity making] contributor, lender, guarantor, or provider of security[, or] and of each person or entity which is the intermediary for[,] such contribution, loan, guarantee, or other security for such loan, and every expenditure made by the candidate and such principal committee, including expenditures not subject to section 3-706.  Disclosure reports shall be submitted at such times and in such form as the board shall require and shall be clearly legible.\n(b) Exceptions.  Notwithstanding paragraph (a) above,\n      (i)  [An] an intermediary need not be reported for any contribution that was collected from a contributor in connection with a party or other candidate-related event held at the residence of the person delivering the contribution, unless the expenses of such events at such residence for such candidate exceed five hundred dollars for a covered election or the aggregate contributions received from that contributor at such events exceed five hundred dollars[.];\n      (ii)  [Contributions] contributions aggregating not more than ninety-nine dollars from any one contributor for all covered elections held in a single calendar year or for a special election need not be separately itemized in disclosure reports submitted to the board on behalf of a participating candidate, provided, however, that contributions which are not itemized shall not be matchable[.];\n      (iii)  [The treasurer of the principal committee need not collect or disclose the occupation, employer, and business address of any contributor making contributions aggregating not more than ninety-nine dollars for all covered elections held in a single calendar year or for a special election.] expenditures of less than fifty dollars need not be separately itemized in disclosure reports submitted to the board, provided, however, that public funds may not be used to pay for such unitemized expenditures; and\n      (iv)  [Disclosure] disclosure reports, other than reports required to be filed every six months in accordance with the schedule specified by the New York state board of elections, need not be submitted on behalf of a participating candidate if the cumulative amount of contributions and loans accepted by such candidate and his or her principal committee following the period covered in the last disclosure report submitted to the campaign finance board on behalf of such candidate is less than two thousand dollars or such higher amount as may be determined by the campaign finance board, provided, however, that disclosure reports shall be submitted on behalf of a participating candidate if that candidate and his or her principal committee have made expenditures in excess of eighty-five percent of the expenditure limitation applicable under section 3-706.  The campaign finance board shall make available to the public a copy of disclosure reports within two business days after they are accepted by the board. \n      11.  Regardless whether a participating candidate demonstrates eligibility for optional public financing under this chapter, a participating candidate and his or her principal committee are nonetheless required to abide by the requirements of paragraphs (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), and (i) [, (k)  and (l)] of subdivision one of this section.\n      \n\t� 5.  Subdivision 2 of section 3-704 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\n2.  Such public funds may not be used for:\n(a) [an] any expenditure in violation of any law;\n\t(b) payments made to the candidate or a spouse, domestic partner, child, grandchild, parent, grandparent, brother or sister of the candidate or spouse or domestic partner of such child, grandchild, parent, grandparent, brother or sister, or to a business entity in which the candidate or any such person has a ten percent or greater ownership interest;\n\t(c) payments in excess of the fair market value of services, materials, facilities or other things of value received in exchange;\n\t(d)  (i)  any expenditure made after the candidate has been finally disqualified or had his or her petitions finally declared invalid by the New York city board of elections or a court of competent jurisdiction, except that such expenditures may be made:\n\t(A)  as otherwise permitted pursuant to subdivision seven of section 3-709 of this chapter, or\n\t(B)  for a different covered election, other than a special election to fill a vacancy, held later in the same [calender] calendar year in which the candidate seeks election for the same office; provided, however, that public funds originally received for a special election to fill a vacancy may not be retained for expenditure in any other election;\n\t(ii)  any expenditure made after the only remaining opponent of the candidate has been finally disqualified or had his or her petitions declared invalid by the New York city board of elections or a court of competent jurisdiction, except that such expenditures may be made for a different covered election, other than a special election to fill a vacancy, held later in the same calendar year in which the candidate seeks election for the same office; provided, however, that public funds originally received for a special election to fill a vacancy may not be retained for expenditure in any other election;\n\t(e)  payments in cash;\n      (f)  any contribution, transfer, or loan made to another candidate or political committee;\n      (g)  gifts, except brochures, buttons, signs and other printed campaign material; [or]\n      (h)  [any] expenditures made pursuant to subdivision four of section 3-706[.];\n      (i)  payment of penalties assessed or imposed by any government agency, including the campaign finance board;\n      (j)  expenditures to comply with the provisions of this chapter or the New York state election law, including legal fees, accounting fees, the cost of record creation and retention, and other necessary compliance expenditures;\n      (k)  payments to contributors, up to the amount of public funds received as a result of all contributions received from such contributors;\n      (l)  expenditures made after the date of the last election for which the participating candidate is on the ballot;\n      (m)  expenditures made in connection with any action, suit, or proceeding before any court, quasi-judicial, or government agency or arbitrator;\n      (n)  expenditures which have not been itemized in a disclosure statement; or\n      (o)  repayment of advances.\n\n\t� 6.  Subdivisions 2 and 4 of section 3-705 of the administrative code of the city of New York are amended to read as follows:\n\t2.  (a)  If the threshold for eligibility is met, the participating candidate's principal committee shall receive payment for qualified campaign expenditures of [four] three dollars for each one dollar of matchable contributions, up to [one thousand] seven hundred fifty dollars in public funds per contributor (or up to [five hundred] three hundred seventy-five dollars in public funds per contributor in the case of a special election), obtained and reported to the campaign finance board in accordance with the provisions of this chapter[,].\n\t(b)  [but in] Except as otherwise provided in subdivision three of section 3-706, in no case shall [such] a principal committee receive [in] public funds pursuant to paragraph (a) above in excess of an amount [exceeding] equal to (i) for participating candidates for nomination for election or election to the City Council, $70,000, and (ii) for all other participants, fifty-five percent of the expenditure limitation provided in subdivision one of section 3-706 for the office for which such candidate seeks nomination for election or election[, except as otherwise provided in subdivision three of section 3-706].\n\t(c)  No funds shall be provided pursuant to this subdivision with respect to any covered election specified in subdivision five of this section.\n\t4.  The campaign finance board shall make possible payment within four business days after receipt of reports of matchable contributions, or as soon thereafter as is practicable, but not earlier than the earliest dates for making such payments as provided in subdivisions five and six of section 3-709; provided, however, that the board may withhold up to ten percent of all public funds payments until the final pre-election payment for any given election.\n      � 7.

A participant is eligible to participate in a debate for each election in which he or she is on the ballot [except that in the second general election debate the candidate shall] if he or she has [meet] met such criteria for participation as [may] shall be specified in [the application] any agreement between [submitted by] the debate sponsor [pursuant to paragraph (b) of subdivision five of this section] and the board.\n     (b) In any year in which a run-off primary or run-off special election to fill a vacancy for a city-wide office is held, any participating candidate for nomination or election to such city-wide office who is on the ballot shall participate in one run-off election debate.\n\t(c) In the case of a primary, the debate shall be among participating candidates seeking nomination of the same political party who meet the requirements provided in paragraph (a) of this subdivision.  If there is no contested primary for an office in a political party then no debate for that party's nomination shall be held pursuant to this section.\n     (d)  Each debate held pursuant to this section shall be at least one hour's duration.\n\t2.  For purposes of this section, a \"debate\" shall mean the moderated reciprocal discussion of issues among candidates on the ballot for the same office.\n     3.  The campaign finance board shall select [sponsors for two debates for each election in which debates among participating candidates are] one or more sponsors for each debate required pursuant to this section.  For [a] primary, general [election] and special elections, the second debate shall be a debate among the leading contenders for the office, as described in paragraph (b) of subdivision five of this section.\n\t4.  Organizations which are not affiliated with any political party or with any holder of or candidate for public office, which have not endorsed any candidate in the pending primary, special, general, or [runoff] run-off election for the city-wide office shall be eligible to sponsor one or more of the required debates.  The rules for conducting such debates shall be solely the responsibility of the organizations selected but shall not be made final without consultation with the campaign finance board.  The organizations selected shall be responsible for choosing the date, time and location of the debates.  \n     5.  Written applications by organizations to sponsor [an election] a debate shall be submitted to the campaign finance board on a form provided by the board not later than a date chosen by the board in any year in which an election is held for city-wide offices.  \n\t(a) The written application shall:\n(i)\tdemonstrate that the organization and any proposed co-sponsor meet the criteria of subdivision four of this section;\n(ii)\tspecify the election and office for which the organization seeks to sponsor the debate;\n(iii)\tset forth the date, time, duration, and location of the debate and the specific and exclusive circumstances under which the date or time may be changed, together with a provision for when the rescheduled debate would be held;\n(iv)\tprovide a detailed description of the format and ground rules for the debate;\n(v)\tverify that the staging, promotion, and coverage of the debate shall be in conformance with all applicable laws;\n[(vi)\tinclude an agreement to indemnify the city for any liability arising from the acts or omissions of the sponsor; and]\n (vi)   \tset forth plans for publicity and for broadcast and other media coverage for the debate[.]; and\n(vii)\tset forth the criteria for determining which candidates are eligible to participate in each debate the organization seeks to sponsor, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this subdivision.\n\t(b)(i)  \t\tExcept as otherwise provided in subparagraph (ii) below, each debate for a primary, general or special election shall include only those participants the sponsor of each such debate has determined meet the non-partisan, objective, and non-discriminatory criteria set forth in any agreement between the sponsor and the board; provided, however, that the criteria for the first debate for a primary, general, or special election shall provide, among other criteria, that a participant shall be eligible to participate in such debate if such participant has, by the last filing date prior to such debate, either (A) spent, contracted, or obligated to spend, or (B) received in contributions, an amount equal to or more than twenty percent of the threshold for eligibility for public funding applicable to such participant contained in subdivision two of section 3-703; provided further, that the second debate for a primary, general, or special election shall include only those participants who the sponsor has also determined are leading contenders on the basis of additional non-partisan, objective, and non-discriminatory criteria set forth in any agreement between the sponsor and the board.  Nothing in this provision is intended to limit the debates to the two major political parties.\n[The second debate for a general election shall include only those candidates who the sponsor has determined are the leading contenders for the office on the basis of the objective, non-partisan, and non-discriminatory criteria.  These criteria must be set forth in the sponsor's written application.]\n(ii)\tIf [the] a debate sponsor [of the second general election debate] has determined that a candidate who is not a participating candidate [is a leading contender for the office on the basis of such criteria] has met all the non-partisan, objective, and non-discriminatory criteria applicable to participants for access to either a first or second primary, general or special election debate, the sponsor may invite that candidate to participate in [the] such debate.  In the case of a [runoff] run-off primary election or a run-off special election, the sponsor may invite a non-participating candidate to participate in [the debate(s)] such debate.  However, if a non-participant [leading contender] does not accept such invitation to debate or does not appear at such debate, the debate shall go forward as scheduled [with the other previously selected leading contender or contenders in the case of a second general election debate or participating candidate on the ballot in the case of a runoff election debate]; provided, however, that if there is only one candidate participating in any such debate, the debate sponsor, after consultation with the board and the candidate, may choose to cancel the debate.\n\t[(c)  In the case of the second general election debate, the application shall also provide for an alternative non-partisan voter education program that the sponsor shall provide for any participating candidates not deemed leading contenders.]\n      6.

In addition to the sufficiency of the application, the board shall consider the applicant's ability to reach a wide audience and present a fair and impartial debate.  The board may accept an application subject to modifications as it deems appropriate and as are acceptable to the sponsor.\n      8.  For [the two primary] all debates [and the first general election debate], the board shall provide each debate sponsor it has selected with a list of candidates who are [required] eligible to be considered to participate in such debates.\n      9.  If a candidate fails to participate in any debate required under this section, the candidate (i) shall be liable for return of moneys previously received for use by the candidate to pay election campaign expenses [and], (ii) shall be ineligible to receive any further matching funds for that election, and (iii) may be subject to penalties pursuant to section 3-711 of this chapter.  For purposes of this subdivision, each primary, general, special or run-off election shall be considered a separate election.\n\t10.  Following the submission of a petition on behalf of the candidate and a hearing before the board, the [penalty] sanction(s) provided in subdivision nine above applicable to a participating candidate for failure to participate in any debate as required under this section [shall] may be waived upon a determination by the board that the failure to participate in the debate occurred under circumstances beyond the control of the candidate and of such nature that a reasonable person would find the failure justifiable or excusable.\n\t11.  Nothing contained in this section shall preclude any candidate from agreeing to participate in any number of additional debates between any and all candidates for a city-wide office, including those candidates not participating in the campaign finance program.  These debates need not be held under guidelines or the purview of the campaign finance board.\n     12.  The city shall indemnify each sponsor for any liability of such sponsor arising out of the acts or omissions of the city or such sponsor taken or failed to be taken in connection with the debate(s) sponsored by any sponsor or with this section 3-709.5 generally.\n\n\t� 11.

(a)  If a participating candidate whose principal committee has received public funds is disqualified by a court of competent jurisdiction on the grounds that such candidate committed fraudulent acts in order to obtain a place on the ballot and such decision is not reversed, such candidate and his or her principal committee shall pay to the board an amount equal to the total of public funds received by such principal committee.\n     (b)  If the board determines that a participant has fundamentally breached the terms and conditions contained in his or her certification, such participant shall return to the board all public funds previously received for all the elections covered by the certification and shall be ineligible to receive additional public funds for such elections.  Such participant may be subject to additional criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions pursuant to section 3-711 of this chapter.  Notwithstanding anything otherwise provided for in this paragraph, any participant whom the board has determined has fundamentally breached the terms and conditions contained in his or her certification must continue to comply with the provisions of this chapter and the rules promulgated hereunder, including but not limited to the disclosure requirements, the contribution limitations and prohibitions, and the expenditure limitations.\n\n      � 12.

The board shall publish a schedule of civil penalties for common infractions and violations, including examples of aggravating and mitigating circumstances that may be taken into account by the board in assessing such penalties.  This schedule shall reflect that infractions are less serious failures to comply with the provisions of this chapter. \n\n\t� 13.
