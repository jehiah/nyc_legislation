In furtherance of this function the department shall include in any contract with a local development corporation under which such local development corporation is engaged in providing economic development services on behalf of the city and expending city capital appropriations in connection therewith, a requirement that such local development corporation submit to the mayor [and], the council, borough boards and community planning boards by May 1, 1994 and by January 31 of each succeeding year, a report for the prior year in the form prescribed hereunder with regard to projected and actual jobs created and retained in connection with any project undertaken by such local development corporation for the purpose of the creation or retention of jobs, whether or not such project involves the expenditure  of city capital appropriations, if in connection with such project assistance to a business entity was provided by such local development corporation in the form of a loan, grant or tax benefit in excess of two hundred fifty thousand dollars, or a sale or lease of land where the project is estimated to retain or create [not less than 25] jobs. The report shall be made with regard to each such project for the first seven years after any such assistance was first provided and shall contain the following information with respect thereto: (i) its name; (ii) its location; (iii) the time span over which the project is to receive any such assistance; (iv) the type of such assistance provided; (v) the number of jobs projected to be created or retained for the first seven years after any such assistance was first provided; (vi) an estimate of the actual number of jobs created or retained to date; (vii) the estimated amount, for that year and  cumulatively to date, of such assistance; (viii) the estimated amount, for that year and  cumulatively to date, of retained or additional tax revenue derived from the project; and (ix) a projection of the retained or additional tax revenue to be derived from the project for the remainder of the seven year period beginning when assistance was first provided.
