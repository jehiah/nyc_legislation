Legislative Findings and Intent\n\tAs the cultural capital of the world, New York City offers residents and visitors a wide array of nightclubs, bars and restaurants to enjoy.

To deter this criminal activity, the Council finds that the police commissioner should be given the discretion to allow members of the police force, while in uniform and off-duty, to provide security services at locations where alcohol is used or sold.  Although state law does not permit a police official to be \"either directly or indirectly interested in the manufacture or sale of alcoholic beverages\"  (Alcohol Beverage Control Act �128), as indicated by a state appeals court decision, \"it does not follow that section 128 otherwise prohibits police officers from working for any employer in or about a licensed premises, no matter how incidental is the work to the sale of alcoholic beverages.\"  Rotunno v.
