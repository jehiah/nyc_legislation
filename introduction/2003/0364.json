Legislative Intent and Findings\n\tThe City Council hereby finds and declares that it is the right of every person, regardless of race, color, creed, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age, or disability to be secure and protected from fear, intimidation and physical harm caused by the activities of violent groups and individuals.  It is not the intent of this local law to interfere with the exercise of the constitutionally protected rights of freedom of expression and association.  The City Council hereby recognizes the constitutional right of every citizen to harbor and express beliefs on any subject whatsoever, to associate with others who share similar beliefs, to petition lawfully constituted authority for a redress of perceived grievances, and to participate in the electoral process.\n\tThe City Council finds, however, that neighborhoods and schools throughout the city are easily terrorized by street gangs.\n\tThe Council further finds that it is prudent to institute reasonable laws so as to make it a violation to solicit or recruit or to conspire to solicit or recruit a person as a member of a criminal street gang, or to deter a person from leaving a criminal street gang.\n\t� 2.
