Legislative Findings and Intent.\n      Auxiliary police officers are a deterrent to crime and provide a valuable service as an additional set of \"eyes and ears\" for the New York City Police Department.  New York City, as the cultural capital of the world, has a wide array of nightclubs, bars and restaurants that, as indicated by recent events, may be the location of criminal acts or other violence.  To assist in deterring this behavior, the New York City Council finds that it is appropriate to allow auxiliary police officers of the New York City Police Department, while off-duty, to provide security services at such locations.\n      �2.  Chapter one of title 14 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 14-148.1, to read as follows:\n      �14-148.1 Auxiliary police; provision of security services while off-duty.\n      Duly enrolled members in good standing of the auxiliary police shall be permitted to work, while off-duty and in uniform, for premises licensed to sell beer or alcohol, provided that such employment is limited to the provision of security services only, and provided that such employment is only for the security of the perimeter of the premises or property adjacent to the premises.
