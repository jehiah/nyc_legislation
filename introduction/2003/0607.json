Legislative findings and intent.\n\tThe events of September 11, 2001 demonstrated the spirit of volunteerism and selflessness of New Yorkers.  Since that day it has become abundantly clear that a huge wellspring of vital emergency response skills and abilities remains untapped among residents of this city, who eagerly await the opportunity to assist in the city's emergency planning and to be part of any emergency response.\n\tThe Council finds that it is in the best interests of the city to harness these skills and abilities in a meaningful and coordinated manner, and that an Office of Emergency Volunteers should be established under the aegis of the Department of Emergency Management.  This Office of Emergency Volunteers will coordinate all aspects of the city's program for volunteers to participate in emergency response, including creation of community response and medical reserve teams, and recruitment of residents with language and cultural skills, knowledge of technology and computers, and medical abilities.\n \t�2. Chapter 19-A of the Charter of the city of New York shall be amend by adding a new section 499, to read as follows:\n\n\t�499. Office of Emergency Volunteers.
