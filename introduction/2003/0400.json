Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for the purpose of this section a \"group of tenants\" is defined as the lesser of five tenants and/or lawful occupants residing in five separate dwelling units or the tenants and/or lawful occupants residing in fifteen percent of the total number of occupied dwelling units.\n      (b)  Any tenant petition shall include the following information:\n      (1)  An identification of the premises by street number or by such other description as will enable the department to locate the dwelling;\n      (2)  The name, dwelling unit identification or designation, such as an apartment or suite number or letter, and signature of each petitioner;\n      (3)  A statement that each petitioner is either a tenant or a lawful occupant of the premises, currently resides on such premises and is requesting a building-wide inspection; and\n      (4)  The identification of two petitioners designated for the purpose of receiving and responding to all official correspondence from the department with regards to this petition, and for the purpose of arranging to provide access to the department.\n      (c)  The department shall respond in writing within ten days of the receipt of the petition by either providing a notice that contains the scheduled date upon which such inspection will take place or a notice stating that no inspection will be conducted and the reason for such determination.  Where the department fails to respond to such petition, then the group of tenants who signed the petition have the right to file a formal complaint with the department as to its procedures.  The department must respond within thirty days of the receipt of such formal complaint.  Where the department does not respond within such thirty day period, the complaint shall be deemed to have been denied.\n      �2.
