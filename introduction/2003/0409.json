  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      Section 1.   Legislative findings and intent.  Existing federal, state and local consumer protection laws do not generally regulate private child support collection agencies.  Furthermore, current industry practices, as reflected in consumer complaints and litigation, raise significant questions about the implications of the lack of such regulation.  Specifically, the Council finds that alleged practices, including, but not limited to, charging exorbitant and excessive fees, threats and abusive telephone calls directed at both custodial and non-custodial parents, signing custodial parents to contracts with unclear terms, collecting fees for payments of child support collected primarily by a government agency, and utilizing unclear accounting practices that lead to the designation of current payments of child support as arrears in order to prevent parents from ever satisfying their obligations to such agencies, necessitate the creation of basic consumer protections for consumer-parents interacting with these agencies.  The Council also finds that current, timely and/or on-going payments of orders of child support are part of a family's income needed to meet basic needs.  Therefore, the Council finds that private child support collection agencies should be regulated by New York City's consumer protection laws, and that the fees collected by such agencies should be reasonably related to the work and services provided.\n      �2.\tSubdivisions b and c of section 20-489 of the administrative code of the city of New York are relettered as subdivisions c and d, and a new subdivision b is added to read as follows:\n      b.\tThe term \"child support\" means a sum to be paid by either or both parents pursuant to court order or decree or pursuant to a valid agreement between the parties for care, maintenance and education of a child.\n      �3.  \tRelettered subdivision d of section 20-489 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\n      [c.] d.      The term \"debt\" means any obligation or alleged obligation of a consumer to pay money arising out of a transaction in which the money, property, insurance, or services which are the subject of the transaction are primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, whether or not such obligation has been reduced to judgment, or any obligation or alleged obligation arising out of a judgment or valid agreement for the payment of child support. \n      �4.  Subchapter 30 of chapter two of title 20 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new subdivision c to section 20-492 to read as follows:\n\tc. Any debt collection agency subject to the provisions of section 20-494.1 shall furnish to the commissioner a current  version of the disclosure form required under section 20-494.1(e) together with a copy of such agency's standard contract for child support payment debt collection services upon applying for a debt collection agency license or renewal thereof.  Any contract for child support payment debt collection services shall not be deemed valid or in force and effect until the department has completed a review of and approved a debt collection agency's standard contract, which review shall be completed and approval or disapproval provided within ninety days after submission of such contract to the department.  Any amendment or modification of such standard contract or disclosure form shall be provided to the commissioner within sixty days following such amendment or modification.\n\t�5. Section 20-494 of subchapter 30 of chapter two of title 20 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\n\t� 20-494 Penalties. a. Any person who, after notice and hearing shall be found guilty of violating any provision of this subchapter, shall be punished in accordance with the provisions of chapter one of this title and shall be subject to a penalty of not less than seven hundred dollars nor more than one thousand dollars for each violation.\n\tb. In addition to any other penalties, if a person is found to have committed [, repealed] repeated, multiple or persistent violations of any provision of this subchapter, [he] such person may be responsible for the cost of the department's investigation.\n      �6. Subchapter 30 of chapter two of title 20 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 20-494.1 to read as follows:\n      �20-494.1 Prohibited and required practices relating to the collection of child support payments.  a.  For purposes of this section the following terms shall have the following meanings:\n      1.  \"Current payment of child support\" shall mean a payment made pursuant to a schedule arising out of a judgment or valid agreement for the payment of child support which is made within thirty days of such payment's due date.\n      2.  \"Potential client\" shall mean a person seeking child support debt collection services from a debt collection agency.\n      b.  Any agreement or contract for the collection of child support payments shall be in writing and shall not extend beyond twelve consecutive months.  Renewal of such contracts shall not be automatic and shall require the consent in writing of all parties to the contract.\n      c.   No debt collection agency that collects child support payments shall:\n      1.   charge interest or otherwise impose a charge or fee for its services that exceeds fifteen percent of each child support payment collected.\n      2.  charge interest or otherwise impose a charge or fee with respect to child support payments collected primarily through the efforts of a governmental entity. \n      3.  charge interest or otherwise impose a charge or fee for a current payment of child support.  \n      4.  impose a charge or fee for the costs of an application.\n      5. impose a charge or fee for legal services unless paid to an independent firm, practitioner or agency for actual costs incurred and unless agreed upon in writing by the potential client.\n      6.  impose a charge or fee for the termination of a contract for the collection of child support.\n      7. impose a charge or fee that does not bear a reasonable relationship to the amount of child support actually collected.\n      8.  designate a current payment of child support as arrears.\n      9.  prohibit the termination of a contract  for the collection of child support payments until arrears are paid.\n      10.  include any terms in a contract for the collection of child support that conflict or are inconsistent with the terms set out in this subchapter.\n      d.  an agreement for the collection of child support shall terminate automatically if no payment of child support has been collected by such debt collection agency for a period of  six consecutive months. \n\te.  Any debt collection agency that collects child support payments shall provide to a potential client a written disclosure form at the same time as such agency first furnishes such potential client with any informational or promotional materials, application or contract for services, regardless of the manner in which such materials are provided including, but not limited to, in-person contact, fax, regular mail, internet or other electronic means, containing, but not limited to,  the following information prominently disclosed in a meaningful sequence:\n\t1.  No obligation.

Legislative findings and intent.  \\b0 Existing federal, state and local consumer protection laws do not generally regulate private child support collection agencies.  Furthermore, current industry practices, as reflected in consumer complaints and litigation, raise significant questions about the implications of the lack of such regulation.  Specifically, the Council finds that alleged practices, including, but not limited to, charging exorbitant and excessive fees, threats and abusive telephone calls directed at both custodial and non-custodial parents, signing custodial parents to contracts with unclear terms, collecting fees for payments of child support collected primarily by a government agency, and utilizing unclear accounting practices that lead to the designation of current payments of child support as arrears in order to prevent parents from ever satisfying their obligations to such agencies, necessitate the creation of basic consumer protections for consumer-parents interacting with these agencies.  The Council also finds that current, timely and/or on-going payments of orders of child support are part of a family\\rquote s income needed to meet basic needs.  Therefore, the Council finds that private child support collection agencies should be regulated by New York City\\rquote s consumer protection laws, and that the fees collected by such agencies should be reasonably related to the work and services provided.\\par\n\\b\\'a72.\\b0\\tab Subdivisions b and c of section 20-489 of the administrative code of the city of New York are relettered as subdivisions c and d, and a new subdivision b is added to read as follows:\\par\nb.\\tab\\ul The term \\ldblquote child support\\rdblquote  means a sum to be paid by either or both parents pursuant to court order or decree or pursuant to a valid agreement between the parties for care, maintenance and education of a child.\\par\n\\ulnone\\b\\'a73.\\b0   \\tab Relettered subdivision d of section 20-489 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\\par\n[c.] \\ul d\\ulnone .
