In order for the Council to adequately fulfill its Charter Section 29 mandate of investigation and oversight, it is important that each department produce information relevant to the Council's inquiries.  Frequently, however, it requires time and negotiation before the Council receives copies of the policies and procedures of agencies, including the Fire Department and Department of Correction.\n      The Council finds that it must have ready access to the policies and procedures of the Fire Department and Department of Correction in order for the Council to fulfill its power and obligation to conduct effective oversight of these agencies and to protect public safety.  Accordingly, the Council finds it reasonable and necessary to require the Fire Department and Department of Correction to provide the Council with continuously updated copies of their policies and procedures.\n      � 2.
