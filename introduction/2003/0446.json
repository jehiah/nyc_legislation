The Council hereby finds that there is a shortage of parks within the City to provide the necessary facilities for fresh air and recreation for the growing population, and that the creation and establishment of parks is essential to the health, comfort and welfare of the citizens of the City.  The Council recognizes that the 175 acres of land in the Section 1/9 of the Fresh Kills Landfill was used for recovery and investigation of the incidents of September 11, 2001 at the World Trade Center. The Council believes that these sections should be set aside as parkland and for a future memorial, not only for the victims of September 11, 2001, but also as a dedication to the efforts of crime scene investigators and forensic experts who, over a ten month span, discovered more than 54,000 personal items and 1,400 human remains among the 1.62 million tons of debris sifted through at this section of the Fresh Kills Landfill.\n      �2.
