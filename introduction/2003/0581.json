An applicant for a license as a master electrician or special electrician must be over the age of twenty-one years, of good moral character and, at the time of applying for examination, shall have had, during the ten (10) years immediately preceding his or her application,  at least seven and one-half (71/2) years or the equivalent as indicated below and during such time a minimum of [seventy-five hundred  (7500)] ten thousand five hundred (10,500)  hours or the equivalent as indicated below of satisfactory experience in the installation, alteration and repair of wiring and appliances for electric light, heat and power in or on buildings or comparable facilities.

Any person who attended courses in a college or university leading to a degree in electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, bachelor of science in electrical engineering or mechanical engineering, who passed all subjects in the required courses shall be credited with  satisfactory experience equal to fifty per cent (50%) of the number of curricula years he or she has satisfactorily completed which, in no event, however, shall exceed two and one-half (21/2) years credit of satisfactory experience, the balance of the required seven and one-half (71/2) years, i.e., five (5) years and during such time a minimum of [five thousand (5000)] seven thousand (7000) hours of such experience must have been obtained by working with his or her tools on the installation, alteration and repair of wiring and apparatus for light, heat and power in or on buildings or comparable facilities, or\n\t5.

An employee of a government agency, private inspection agency or other entity, acceptable to the commissioner, whose duties primarily involve the inspection of electrical work for compliance with the electrical code and the electrical code technical standards and/or other laws relating to the installation, alteration or repair of electrical wiring or appliances  shall be credited with fifty percent (50%) of the number of years that he or she has been satisfactorily  employed in such duties within the ten (10) year period prior to application, which, however, in no event, shall exceed two and one-half (2 1/2) years credit of satisfactory experience.  The balance of the required seven and one-half (7 1/2) years, i.e., five (5) years and during such time a minimum of [five thousand (5000)] seven thousand (7000) hours of such experience must have been obtained by working with his or her tools on the installation, alteration and repair of wiring and appliances for electric light, heat and power in or on buildings or comparable facilities except that the requirement of subdivision a of this section that an applicant's working experience must have been within the ten (10) year period prior to application shall not apply to such balance of five (5) years working experience required pursuant to this paragraph.   \n\tc. Every applicant shall be required to take an examination in accordance with the rules of the department.  However, where the application is on behalf of a city agency, the commissioner may waive the examination requirement if the applicant has sufficient experience qualifications, as determined by the commissioner. \n\t�2.  Subdivision a of section 27-3015 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law 64 for the year 2001, is amended to read as follows:\n\ta.  Any license and seal issued hereunder may be renewed without examination, provided application for such renewal, accompanied by the renewal fees prescribed above and such information as may be required by the commissioner to ensure compliance with section 27-3016 of this chapter, shall have been filed prior to the expiration of the existing license. Where an applicant can show good and sufficient cause for his or her inability to renew his or her license and seal before its expiration, the commissioner may, within thirty days after the expiration of such license, permit the issuance, without examination, of a new license and seal upon payment of the prescribed fees for such new license and seal within said thirty days.  No license shall be renewed and no new license and seal shall be issued unless all outstanding fees required by section 27-3018 of this code have been paid.  The commissioner may promulgate rules requiring applicants for the renewal of master or special electrician's licenses to submit proof, in such form as he or she shall determine, that, in each year of the license term, such applicant completed at least ten hours of continuing education courses approved by the department.  Such proof shall be submitted not less than two months prior to the expiration of the license term.    \n\t�3.  Subdivision b of section 27-3018 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 64 for the year 2001, is amended to read as follows:\n\tb.  Before commencing any electrical work, other than low voltage electrical work, a master electrician business or special electrician shall file with the commissioner an application for a permit and, if applicable, certificate of electrical inspection for such work on a form prescribed by the commissioner.\n\tNo such work shall be performed until the commissioner has reviewed and approved such application and issued an appropriate permit for such work.  The permit shall be conspicuously posted at the work site at all times while the work is in progress. Each permit shall be issued with an expiration date to be determined in accordance with the rules of the department, but not less than one year after the date of issuance. An expired permit may be renewed in accordance with the rules of the department upon payment of a renewal fee as set forth in such rules.  \n\t�4.  Subdivision a of section 27-3024 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 41 for the year 2002, is amended to read as follows:\n\ta.  The city of New York hereby adopts the [1999] 2002 edition of the National Fire Protection Association NFPA 70  National Electrical Code as the minimum requirements for the design, installation, alteration or repair of electric wires and wiring apparatus and other appliances used or to be used  for the transmission of electricity for electric light, heat, power, signaling, communication, alarm and data transmission in the city  subject to the amendments  adopted by local law and set forth in section 27-3025 of this subchapter, which shall be known and cited as \" the New York city amendments to the [1999] 2002 National Electrical Code\".  Such [1999] 2002 edition of the National Fire Protection Association NFPA 70  National Electrical Code with such New York city amendments  shall together be known and cited as the \"electrical code technical standards\". [The electrical code technical standards shall apply to electrical work performed on and after January first, two thousand three except that, the commissioner may promulgate rules to extend the date of application for an additional period, not to exceed one hundred eighty days, for any electrical code technical standard as he or she deems necessary.]  The commissioner shall make a copy of the electrical code technical standards available for public inspection at the department of buildings.\n\t�5.  Section 27-3025 of the administrative code of the city of New York is REPEALED and a new section 27-3025 is added to read as follows:\n\t�27-3025  The New York city amendments to the 2002 National Electrical Code.  The following New York city amendments to the 2002 National Electrical Code are hereby adopted as set forth in this section:\n\t2002 NEC  New York city amendment\n\t110.2\tRevise section 110.2 to read as follows:\n\t110.2\tApproval of Electrical Materials, Equipment and Installations.\n\t(A) Listed and Approved Materials and Equipment.
