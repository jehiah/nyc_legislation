  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n      Section 1.  Legislative Intent and Findings\n      The City Council hereby finds and declares that it is the right of every person who attends New York City public schools to have the opportunity to learn and teach in an environment free from intimidation and physical harm caused by the activities of groups and individuals. Crime in public schools, though lower in recent years, is still far too high.  For the period July 1, 2001 through June 30, 2002, for example, there were 5 rapes, 416 sex offenses, 232 robberies and 1,489 assaults in our city's schools.  Furthermore, the number of burglaries and incidents of grand larceny, arson, and reckless endangerment during this same period increased from the previous fiscal year.  Additionally, there have been recent reports of increased assaults against staff members in elementary, middle and high schools. \n      To foster an atmosphere free of violence, video cameras have been installed in traditional public fora, such as public parks, streets and housing facilities.  These cameras provide law enforcement with additional eyes and ears and have greatly assisted in reducing crime in areas where they are placed. Additionally, it is cost-effective to have a video security device in conjunction with live school security agents.\n      It is not the intent of this local law to interfere with the exercise of the constitutionally protected rights of freedom of expression and association, nor to infringe on students' right to privacy. For this reason, the City Council recognizes that such cameras must be placed only at entrance and exit doors so that school and police officials may more easily monitor activities at these locations.\n      � 2. Chapter 20 of the charter of the city of New York is amended by adding the following new section 528:\n      �528. The installation and operation of video security cameras in New York City public schools\n      a.   Installation and Operation of video security cameras. The New York City Department of Education, in consultation with the New York City Police Department, shall install video security cameras at all entrance and exit doors of each school operated by the Department of Education. The operation and placement of video security cameras shall be incorporated into the school safety plan mandated by state education law.\n      b. Rules and Regulations. The New York City Police Department shall promulgate rules and regulations that account for accessing, archiving, monitoring, reproducing, destroying and erasing filmed material from video security cameras, and such rules shall also incorporate penalties for any personnel who violate these regulations.  \n \t�3  This local law shall take effect 90 days after its enactment. \n\nMFK\nLS#2519\n5/20/03\n\n\n\n\n\n2",
