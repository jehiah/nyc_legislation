Cause of Action Against Weapons Manufacturers\n      a. For the purposes of this section: (1) \"weapon\" shall mean a firearm, rifle, shotgun, or assault weapon, as such terms are defined in section 10-301;\n      (2) \"dealer\" shall mean a \"dealer in firearms\" and a \"dealer in rifles and shotguns\", as such terms are defined in section 10-301;\n      (3) \"importer\" shall mean any person engaged in the business of importing or bringing weapons into the United States for sale or distribution;\n      (4) \"manufacturer\" shall mean any person in business to manufacture or assemble a weapon for sale or distribution. \n      b.
