Upon application, such amount shall be redetermined so as to re-establish the ratio of adjusted rent to aggregate disposable income which existed at the time of the approval of such eligible head of the household's last application for a rent exemption order or for renewal thereof; provided, however, that in no event shall the amount of the adjusted rent be redetermined to be (i) in the case of a head of the household who does not receive a monthly allowance for shelter pursuant to the social services law, less than one-third of the aggregate disposable income; or (ii) in the case of a head of the household who receives a monthly allowance for shelter pursuant to the social services law, less than the maximum allowance for shelter which such head of the household is entitled to receive pursuant to such law. For purposes of this paragraph, a decrease in aggregate disposable income shall not include any decrease in such income resulting from the manner in which such income is calculated pursuant to any amendment to paragraph c of subdivision one of section four hundred sixty-seven-b of the real property tax law or any amendment to the regulations of the department for the aging made on or after April first, nineteen hundred eighty-seven. For purposes of this paragraph, \"adjusted rent\" shall mean maximum rent less the amount set forth in a rent exemption order.\n            �2.

For purposes of this paragraph, \"adjusted rent\" shall mean legal regulated rent less the amount set forth in a rent exemption order.\n            �3.  Subdivision (d) of section 26-605 of such code, as added by chapter 584 of the laws of 1987, is amended to read as follows:\n            (d)  notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, where an eligible head of the household holds a current, valid rent increase exemption order/tax abatement certificate and, after the effective date of this subdivision, there is a permanent decrease in income in an amount which exceeds twenty percent of such income as represented in such eligible head of household's last approved application for a rent increase exemption order/ tax abatement certificate or for renewal thereof, such eligible head of the household may[, upon renewal of such rent increase exemption order/tax abatement certificate,] apply for a redetermination of the amount set forth therein. Upon application, such amount shall be redetermined so as to re-establish the ratio of adjusted rent to income which existed at the time of approval of such eligible head of the household's last application for a rent increase exemption order/tax abatement certificate or for renewal thereof; provided, however, that in no event shall the amount of the adjusted rent be redetermined to be (i) in the case of an eligible head of the household who does not receive a monthly allowance for shelter pursuant to the social services law, less than one-third of income; or (ii) in the case of an eligible head of the household who receives a monthly allowance for shelter pursuant to the social services law, less than the maximum allowance for shelter which such eligible head of the household is entitled to receive pursuant to law.
