  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection 1.  Section 19-505 of title 19 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new subdivision q to read as follows:\n\tq.  The commission shall implement a process by which all applicants for a taxicab driver's license may obtain such license in an expedited fashion.  Such process shall include the following mandatory components:  1.  Attending a training course authorized by the commission comprised of, but not limited to, the following:  (i) eight hours of instruction focusing upon laws, rules and regulations related to the operation of a taxicab; (ii) eight hours of instruction focusing upon the geography of New York city and the surrounding area, including map reading, and (iii) eight hours of instruction focusing upon passenger relations, including passenger rights, driver courtesy and overview of taxicab services to which passengers have the right to request, such as the engagement of air-conditioning or of any audio equipment controlled by the driver.\n      2.  Achieving a satisfactory score, to be determined by the commission, on a final examination on all taxicab-related subjects included in a training course taken pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision.\n      3.   Achieving a satisfactory score, to be determined by the commission, on an English language proficiency examination that shall test for basic communication skills necessary to the safe and efficient operation of a taxicab and to the provision of quality service to passengers.\n      4.   Satisfactorily completing all other requirements imposed by this section upon applicants for a taxicab driver's license.\n      Upon successful completion of the expedited taxicab driver licensing process set forth in this subdivision, an applicant will be given a temporary taxicab driver's license pending the outcome of any incomplete requirement contained in this section, such as fingerprinting or drug testing, which, when complete, shall result in the issuance of a probationary taxicab driver's license, as defined in the rules of the commission, or revocation of such temporary license for failure to fully meet licensing requirements.  The commission shall establish such expedited process in a manner that allows a successful applicant for an expedited taxicab driver's license to obtain such license within seven business days from the commencement of such process.  Within ten days from the end of each calendar quarter, the commission shall issue a report to the speaker of the council and the mayor that shall, for that calendar quarter, include, but not be limited to, the total number of applicants that enrolled in the expedited taxicab driver licensing process established by this subdivision, the total number of applicants who were issued temporary taxicab driver's licenses and the total number of applicants who were not issued temporary taxicab driver's licenses.  For those who were not issued temporary taxicab driver's licenses, the report shall indicate the total number of enrollees that withdrew from the process prior to completion and, for those who did not withdraw from the process, the reason for such non-issuance indicated by: failure to attend the mandated eight-hours of instruction focusing upon laws, rules and regulations related to the operation of a taxicab set forth in this subdivision; failure to attend the mandated eight-hours of instruction focusing upon the geography of New York city set forth in this subdivision; failure to attend the mandated eight-hours of instruction focusing upon passenger relations and services set forth in this subdivision; failure to achieve a satisfactory score on a final examination on taxicab-related subjects pursuant to this subdivision; failure to achieve a satisfactory score on an English language examination pursuant to this subdivision; and failure to satisfactorily complete any other requirement imposed by this section upon applicants for a taxicab driver's license broken down by each individual such requirement that was not satisfactorily met.\n\tï¿½2.  This local law shall take effect ninety days after its enactment into law, except that the chairperson of the taxi and limousine commission shall be authorized to take such administrative actions deemed necessary to effectuate the provisions of this local law prior to its effective date.\n\nMBS\n10-22-03",
