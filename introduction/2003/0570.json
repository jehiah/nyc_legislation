  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n      Section 1. Declaration of Legislative Findings and Intent.  Recently, in a nightclub in Warwick, Rhode Island, many people lost their lives in a fire that was caused by pyrotechnics.  Investigations revealed that the club had used flammable foam for soundproofing, had a wooden frame, an exit door that swung inwards, missing fire extinguishers, and many other fire hazards.  \n      Due to the provisions of our fire code and the diligent inspections of the Fire Department, such dangerous conditions rarely exist in New York City.  However, not only are places of public assembly difficult to evacuate because of their crowding, but the occupants of places of public assembly such as night clubs are often inebriated.  Nonetheless, places of public assembly are only required to have one fireguard, regardless of their size or number of occupants.  Moreover, fire safety plans for places of public assembly are primarily required to contain a description of the physical space, but need not detail fire safety and evacuation procedures. \n      The Council finds that maintaining a modern fire code is critical to public health and safety.  Accordingly, the Council finds that it is reasonable and necessary to update the fire code provisions relating to places of public assembly.\n\t� 2. Subchapter 28 of chapter 4 of title 27 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\n� 27-4256. Inspections. \n� 27-4256.1. Primary fireguard.\n� 27-4256.2. Fire safety and evacuation plans.\n� 27-4256.3. Employee training and response procedures.\n� 27-4257. Obstruction of aisles and passageways. \n� 27-4258. Exits to be indicated. \n� 27-4259. Locked doors in cabarets, dance halls and places of public amusement. \n� 27-4260. Sprinkler and fire alarm protection and emergency lighting in places of assembly. \n� 27-4261. Means of egress in motion picture theatres. \n� 27-4262. Fire prevention in motion picture theatres. \n� 27-4263. Fire extinguishing appliances in motion picture theatres. \n� 27-4264. Violations.\n      � 27-4256. Inspections. a.
