  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\tSection 1.  Declaration of legislative findings and intent.  The Council finds that employees working for the police department of the city of New York (\"NYPD\") as traffic enforcement agents, as well as those employees working for the sanitation department of the city of New York (\"DSNY\") as sanitation enforcement agents have certain terms and conditions of employment similar to those of the uniformed services of the city of New York, including police, fire, sanitation and correction services.  These terms and conditions of employment raise issues which are materially different than the issues affecting non-uniformed city employees. Furthermore, the Council recognizes that uniformed forces in the police, fire, sanitation and correction departments have certain unique bargaining rights under the New York City Collective Bargaining Law.  The Council intends by this amendment to the administrative code to ensure that those individuals employed by the NYPD as traffic enforcement agents, as well as those individuals employed by the DSNY as sanitation enforcement agents, are accorded the same unique bargaining rights as the uniformed forces of the city.\n\t�2.\tParagraph four of subdivision (a) of section 12-307 of the administrative code of the city of New York is hereby amended to read as follows:\n\t(4) all matters, including but not limited to pensions, overtime and time and leave rules which affect employees in the uniformed police, fire, sanitation and correction services, or any other police officer as defined in subdivision thirty-four of section 1.20 of the criminal procedure law who is also defined as a police officer in this code, shall be negotiated with the certified employee organizations representing the employees involved.  For purposes of this paragraph only, employees of the uniformed fire service shall also include persons employed by the fire department of the city of New York as fire alarm dispatchers and supervisors of fire alarm dispatchers.
