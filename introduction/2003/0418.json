  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection 1. Legislative findings:  The Council finds that many students, teachers, administrators and others in the New York city school communities are plagued by harassing behavior which interferes with students' educational performance, opportunities and emotional or physical well-being and the well-being of the entire school community.  Accordingly, the Council finds that it is necessary to establish strong policies in our City's schools prohibiting harassment for any reason including reasons based on, but not limited to, a person's actual or perceived race, color, national origin, ethnic group, religion, religious practice, disability, sexual orientation, gender, sex, family composition or circumstance, economic circumstance, physical appearance, mannerisms, bearing, school performance or any other characteristic or reason that may not be apparent. \n      � 2. Chapter 1 of title 10 of the administrative code of the city of New York is hereby amended by adding a new section 137 to read as follows:\n\n\t�10-137.  Prevention of harassment on school premises.  \na. Definitions.  For the purposes of this\nsection, the following terms shall have the following meanings:  \n1. \"Gender\" shall mean actual or perceived sex \nand shall also include a person's gender identity, self-image, appearance, behavior or expression, whether or not that gender identity, self-image, appearance, behavior or expression is different from that traditionally associated with the legal sex assigned to that person at birth.\n2. \"Harassment\" shall mean the creation of a \nhostile environment by conduct or by verbal threats, taunting, intimidation or abuse, including conduct, verbal threats, intimidation or abuse for any reason, including any reason based on, but not limited to, a person's actual or perceived race, color, national origin, ethnic group, religion, religious practice, disability, sexual orientation, gender, sex, family composition or circumstance, economic circumstance,  physical appearance, mannerisms, bearing, school performance or any other characteristic or reason that may not be apparent that has or would reasonably have the effect of substantially interfering with a student's educational performance, opportunities or benefits, mental, emotional or physical well-being, or that reasonably causes or would reasonably be expected to cause a student or other person to fear for his or her physical safety. \n3. \"Retaliatory action\" shall mean, but not be \nlimited to, dismissal, demotion, suspension, disciplinary action, negative performance evaluation, any action resulting in loss of staff, compensation or other benefit, failure to hire, failure to appoint, failure to promote, or transfer or assignment or failure to transfer or assign against the wishes of the affected person.\n4. \"School\" shall mean a public or private \ninstitution established and operating for the primary purpose of providing educational instruction to students at or below the twelfth grade level, provided, however, that such term shall not include parochial institutions.\n5. \"School function\" shall mean a school-\nsponsored extra-curricular event or activity or any event that takes place on school premises.\n6. \"School premises\" shall mean the buildings, \ngrounds or facilities, or any portion thereof, owned, occupied by, or under the custody or control of public or private institutions, excluding parochial institutions, for the primary purpose of providing educational instruction to students at or below the twelfth grade level, and any vehicles owned, operated or leased by or on behalf of such institutions that are used to transport such students or the personnel of such institutions. \n      b. Prohibition of harassment.  No person shall subject another person to harassment on school premises or at a school function. \nc. Policies and guidelines.

Protection of people who report incidents of harassment.  Any person subjected to harassment or having reasonable cause to suspect that another person has been subjected to harassment on school premises or at a school function, who either reports such information to appropriate school officials or to law enforcement authorities, or otherwise initiates, testifies, participates or assists in any formal or informal proceedings pursuant to this section or any other relevant law, rule or regulation, shall have immunity from any civil liability that may arise from the making of such report or from initiating, testifying, participating or assisting in such formal or informal proceedings, and no school official or employee shall take, request or cause a retaliatory action against any such person who, acting reasonably and in good faith, either makes such a report or initiates, testifies, participates or assists in such formal or informal proceeding. \n\t�3.  If any subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or other portion of this local law is, for any reason, declared unconstitutional or invalid, in whole or in part, by any court of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed severable and such unconstitutionality or invalidity shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of the local law that added this section, which remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect.\nEffective date.  \n      �4.
