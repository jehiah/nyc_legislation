  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\tSection one.  Chapter one of title six of the administrative code of the city of New York is hereby amended to add a new section 6-128 to read as follows:\n\t�6-128. Purchase of re-refined motor oil.  a. For purposes of this section only, the following terms shall have the following meanings:\n(1) \"Base stock\" means the portion of motor oil that does not consist of additives.  \n(2) \"Contract\" means any written agreement, purchase order or instrument whereby the\ncity is committed to expend or does expend funds in return for work, labor, services, supplies, equipment, materials, or any combination of the foregoing.\n\t(3) \"Contracting agency\" means any office, department, administration, authority, \ndivision, bureau, board, commission, corporation, institution or agency of government, the expenses of which are paid in whole or in part from the city treasury.\n\t(4) \"Emergency vehicle\" means any vehicle operated by the police department or the fire department.\n\t(5) \"Reasonably competitive\" means that the cost of the re-refined motor oil does not exceed a cost premium of three percent above the cost of a comparable product that is not re-refined motor oil.  \n\t(6) \"Re-refined motor oil\" means motor oil that contains a base stock consisting of re-\nrefined oil. \n(7) \"Re-refined oil\" means oil from which physical and chemical contaminants acquired \nthrough use have been removed.\n\tb. Except as otherwise provided in this section, when purchasing motor oil, a contracting agency shall, whenever the price is reasonably competitive, purchase motor oil that is licensed by the American Petroleum Institute and (i) contains a base stock of at least seventy percent re-refined oil or (ii) contains a base stock of at least fifty percent re-refined oil if motor oil that contains a base stock of at least seventy percent re-refined oil is not available in sufficient quantities.\n      c. A contracting agency shall make best efforts when entering into a contract for vehicle maintenance, where motor oil is used to perform the contractor's obligations under the contract, to ensure that the contractor uses motor oil that is licensed by the American Petroleum Institute and contains a base stock with the highest content of re-refined oil available for the grade of motor oil used, provided that such efforts do not impede such agency's ability to obtain the highest quality service at the lowest possible price through a competitive procurement.\n\td. This section shall not apply to any contract entered into prior to the effective date of this section, except that the renewal of such contract occurring on or after the effective date shall be subject to the provisions of this section.\n   \te. This section shall not apply:\n   \t(1) to purchases where federal or state funding restrictions preclude the city from \nimposing the requirements of this section;\n(2) to purchases that are emergency procurements pursuant to section three hundred \nfifteen of the charter; \n\t(3) to the purchase or use of motor oil for emergency vehicles; or\n(4) where applicable warranties include conditions that specifically require the use of a \nlubricant other than re-refined motor oil, except that this exception shall not apply to warranties that merely recommend the use of a lubricant other than re-refined motor oil.\n\tf.
