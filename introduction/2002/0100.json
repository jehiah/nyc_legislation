  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\tSection 1.  Title 10 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York is hereby amended by adding a new section 10-137, to read as follows:\n\tSection 10-137 Prohibition of use non-wood bats.  A. Legislative Findings. Since its inception, the game of baseball has been played with a wooden bat.  In the 1970's, baseball bat manufacturers developed aluminum bats for teams who wanted to reduce the cost of replacing broken wooden bats.  Aluminum bats were originally designed to have similar dimensions as wooden bats  but with the durability of metal.  In the last decade, however, the use of new high performance materials in the construction of metal baseball bats has dramatically increased the speed at which baseballs are propelled off bats.  The necessary reaction time by defensive players in the field is shortened, and players are placed in compromising and dangerous positions.  The Council hereby finds that the number of injuries from baseballs batted from non-wood bats is rising and that the use of these non-wood bats places our children at an unacceptable risk of injury.\n\tb. Definitions.  When used herein:\n1. The term \"non-wood bat,\" shall mean any non-wood baseball or softball bat\n including, but not limited to bats made of metal, titanium, scandium, aluminum or any other alloy compound with the exception of wood, composite, laminated or composite-coated wood bats that shall be approved for play upon verified test data that these bats perform, weigh and are balanced like wood bats.\n2. The term \"competitive game,\" shall mean any organized game at which\ncertified  umpires are present.\n\tc. It shall be unlawful for any person to use a non-wood bat in a competitive game in which minors are participants and which is taking place in connection with a league operating in the City of New York including but not limited to, Little Leagues, Babe Ruth Leagues, American Legion games, Public School Athletic Leagues, Catholic High School Athletic Association games on fields including, but not limited to those facilities under the jurisdiction of the New York City Parks Department or Board of Education.\n      ï¿½2.
