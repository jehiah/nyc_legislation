Section 19-508 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new subdivision c to read as follows:\n\t�19-508.  c.  1.  For purposes of this section, the term \"trouble light\" shall mean a help or distress signaling light system consisting of two turn signal type \"lollipop\" lights.\n\t2.  Every for-hire vehicle or taxicab placed into operation shall carry a minimum of two spare turn signal type \"lollipop\" lights of a type approved by the commission.

If the replacement of a bulb or bulbs, or any other corrective action, restores the trouble light to proper working order, no summons or notice of violation may be issued for operating a for-hire vehicle or taxicab with a defective trouble light.  In the event that repair of the defective condition is not made in the presence of such enforcement agent and a summons or notice of violation is issued for a defective for-hire vehicle or taxicab trouble light, such summons or notice of violation shall be dismissed by the adjudicatory body before which such summons or notice of violation is heard if: (a) proof that repair of such defect was made within twenty-four hours of the issuance of the summons or notice of violation is provided to the adjudicatory body and (b) the vehicle was not used for hire during the period of time from when the summons or notice of violation was issued to the time the repair was made.\n\t3.  Any person found to have violated the provisions of this subdivision shall be liable for a fine of one hundred seventy-five dollars for each such violation and in addition thereto the license for such vehicle shall be suspended until the defective condition is corrected. \n      �2.
