  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection 1. Legislative declaration of intent. Clinical medical services for the prevention and early detection of disease have been associated with substantial reductions in morbidity and mortality. A significant portion of illnesses and deaths among New Yorkers are preventable through the use of clinical preventive medical services, including screening tests, counseling services, immunizations and pharmacological regimens. Moreover, clinical preventive medical services are highly cost effective because they reduce the need for emergency care, lessen the severity of disease or trauma and diminish the need for complex and expensive medical care. To encourage the utilization of clinical preventive medical services by city employees, retirees and their families at appropriate intervals, it is the intention of the Council to mandate that health maintenance organizations, health insurance companies and Medicare plan providers under contract with the city of New York fully inform city employees, retirees and their families of the clinical preventive care services provided or covered by such plans, and, on no less than an annual basis, make available to such eligible city employees, retirees and their families, clear and concise written material on the availability and benefits of such clinical preventive medical services.\n      �2. Chapter 1 of title 17 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 17-184 to read as follows:\n      �17-184 Notification and reporting on clinical preventive medical services offered to city employees. a.

No later than thirty days following the effective date of the local law that added this section, the commissioner shall promulgate a list of recommended clinical preventive medical services, including those set forth in a(2) of this section. The commissioner shall update and distribute such list to the office of labor relations, office of employee benefits on an annual basis. \n      e.
