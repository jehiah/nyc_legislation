  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection 1.  Legislative intent.  There are numerous interactions each day between members of the New York City Police Department and members of the public ranging from police inquiries to investigations of violent felonies, and sometimes these encounters are the subject of confusion and misinterpretation both for officers and civilians alike.  Every attempt should be made to minimize such confusion and misinterpretation, and one such method is to require that each patrol car be installed with a video camera to monitor all events.  The NYPD has already recognized the value of having such cameras in highway patrol cars in order to document driving while intoxicated and reckless driving offenses, thus making it easier to secure a conviction.  \n\tThe Council finds that just as cameras are useful in this enforcement function, so too can they be an important tool in preventing and investigating allegations of police misconduct.  The installation of such video cameras will also be of benefit to police officers because the cameras will protect the police from false allegations of misconduct or brutality.\nIn light of the benefits of such cameras, the use of these cameras should be increased because they protect both the public and police officers and can be used as evidence of criminal conduct.  \n      � 2.
