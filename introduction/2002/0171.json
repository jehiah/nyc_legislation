  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\n      Section 1.  Declaration of Legislative Intent and Findings.  \n      The New York City Campaign Finance Act was adopted by the New York City Council in 1988.  The Act, through its administration by the Campaign Finance Board, has succeeded in enhancing competition for elective municipal offices, limiting campaign contributions and expenditures to reasonable levels, and vastly increasing public information about the sources and uses of campaign funds.   New York City's campaign finance program has been a model for the nation and a first-rate example of successful campaign finance reform in action. \n      After greater than a decade of experience, the Council seeks to reaffirm the fundamental goals of the Campaign Finance Act and to strengthen this landmark law through changes that are intended to encourage a continued high level of participation in the voluntary program and  to protect public funds from fraud and unnecessary expenditures.   \n      � 2.  Subdivisions 2, 3, 6, 8 and 10 of section 3-702 of the administrative code of the city of New York are amended to read as follows:\n2. The term \"principal committee\" shall mean the authorized committee designated by a \ncandidate pursuant to [subdivision six] paragraph (e) of subdivision 1 of section 3-703 of this chapter.\n3. The term \"matchable contribution\" shall mean (i) a contribution, (ii) contributions or \n(iii) a portion of a contribution or contributions, not greater than [one thousand dollars] the applicable contribution limitation set forth in paragraph (f) of subdivision one of section 3-703 for all covered elections held in the same calendar year, [other than special elections,] made by a natural person resident in the city of New York to a participating candidate which has been reported in full to the campaign finance board in accordance with subdivision six of section 3-703 by the candidate's principal committee and has been contributed on or before December thirty-first in the year of such election that may be matched by public funds in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.  Matchable contributions comprised of up to one thousand dollars per contributor (or up to five hundred dollars per contributor in a special election to fill a vacancy) may be counted toward the threshold for eligibility of paragraph (a) of subdivision two of section 3-703.  Any contribution, contributions, or a portion of a contribution determined to be invalid for matching funds by the board may not be treated as a matchable contribution for any purpose.  A loan may not be treated as a matchable contribution.  The following contributions are not matchable:\n\t(a) in-kind contributions of property, goods, or services;\n(b) contributions in the form of the purchase price paid for an item with significant intrinsic and enduring value; [and]\n(c) contributions in the form of the purchase price paid for or otherwise induced by a chance to participate in a raffle, lottery, or a similar drawing for valuable prizes;\n(d) money order contributions from any one contributor that are, in the aggregate, greater than $100; and\n\t(e) contributions from individuals under the age of eighteen years.\n      [In a special election to fill a vacancy a matchable contribution shall not be greater than five hundred dollars per contributor.]\n      6.  The term \"threshold for eligibility\" shall mean the total amount of matchable contributions that a participating candidate and [the authorized committees of such candidate] his or her principal committee must receive in order for such candidate to qualify for optional public financing pursuant to this chapter.\n\t8.  The term \"contribution\" shall mean:  (a) any gift, subscription, advance, or deposit of money or any thing of value, made in connection with the nomination for election, or election, of any candidate; (b) any funds received by a political committee from another political committee to the extent such funds do not constitute a transfer; (c) any payment, by any person other than a candidate or a political committee authorized by the candidate, made in connection with the nomination for election, or election, of any candidate, including but not limited to compensation for the personal services of any individual which are rendered in connection with a candidate's election or nomination without charge; provided however, that none of the foregoing shall be deemed a contribution if it is made, taken or performed by a person or a political committee independent of the candidate or his or her agents or political committees authorized by such candidate pursuant to section 14-112 of the New York state election law.  For purposes of this subdivision, the term \"independent of the candidate or his or her agents or political committees authorized by such candidate pursuant to section 14-112 of the  New York state election law\" shall mean that the candidate or his or her agents or political committees so authorized by such candidate did not authorize, request, suggest, foster or cooperate in any such activity; and provided further, that the term \"contribution\" shall not include:\n\t(i)\tthe value of services provided without compensation by individuals who volunteer a portion or all of their time on behalf of a candidate or political committee,\n\t(ii)\tthe use of real or personal property and the cost of invitations, food and beverages voluntarily provided by an individual to a candidate or political committee on the individual's residential premises for candidate-related activities to the extent such services do not exceed five hundred dollars in value, and \n\t(iii)\tthe travel expenses of any individual who on his or her own behalf volunteers his or her personal services to any candidate or political committee to the extent such expenses are unreimbursed and do not exceed five hundred dollars in value.\n      A loan made to a participating candidate or [an authorized committee of such candidate] his or her principal committee other than in the regular course of the lender's business shall be deemed, to the extent not repaid by the date of the [primary or general election, as the case may be] first covered election in which the participating candidate is a participant following the date of the loan, a contribution by the lender.  A loan made to a participating candidate or [an authorized committee of such candidate] his or her principal committee in the regular course of the lender's business shall be deemed, to the extent not repaid by the date of the [primary or general election, as the case may be] first covered election in which the participating candidate is a participant following the date of the loan, a contribution by the obligor on the loan and by any other person endorsing, cosigning, guaranteeing, collateralizing or otherwise providing security for the loan.\n      10. The term \"covered election\" shall mean any primary, [runoff] run-off primary, special, run-off special or general election for nomination for election, or election, to the office of mayor, public advocate, comptroller, borough president or member of the city council.\n      � 3.  Paragraphs (c), (e), (f), (i), (k), and (l) of subdivision 1 of section 3-703 of the administrative code of the city of New York are amended to read as follows:\n\t(c)  choose to participate in the public funding provisions of this chapter, by filing a written certification in such form as may be prescribed by the campaign finance board, which sets forth his or her acceptance of and agreement to comply with the terms and conditions for the provision of such funds.  The deadline for filing such certification for a primary and general election shall be:\n(i) the first day of June in the year of the covered election, or such other later date as the board shall provide; or \n(ii) the thirtieth day after a special election is held to fill a vacancy for the office sought by the candidate;\nwhichever is later.  The deadline for filing such certification for a special election to fill a vacancy shall be on the seventh day after the proclamation of such special election.

All receipts accepted by [an authorized] a principal committee shall be deposited in an account of the [authorized] principal committee.  The treasurer of the [authorized] principal committee shall be responsible for making such deposits.  All deposits shall be made within ten business days of receipt; provided, however, that deposits of contributions made in the form of checks received by candidates for the office of city council more than one year before the first covered election for which such candidate is seeking nomination or election may be made within twenty business days of receipt.

Such rules shall not adversely affect in any manner the eligibility for optional public financing of any such candidate who does not participate in such program, or who terminates his or her participation in such program.] shall review each disclosure report timely submitted by a candidate prior to the last date upon which such candidate may file a certification pursuant to paragraph (c) of subdivision one of this section and issue to the candidate a review before the next disclosure report is due.

Declaration of Legislative Intent and Findings.  \\par\nThe New York City Campaign Finance Act was adopted by the New York City Council in 1988.  The Act, through its administration by the Campaign Finance Board, has succeeded in enhancing competition for elective municipal offices, limiting campaign contributions and expenditures to reasonable levels, and vastly increasing public information about the sources and uses of campaign funds.   New York City's campaign finance program has been a model for the nation and a first-rate example of successful campaign finance reform in action. \\par\nAfter greater than a decade of experience, the Council seeks to reaffirm the fundamental goals of the Campaign Finance Act and to strengthen this landmark law through changes that are intended to encourage a continued high level of participation in the voluntary program and  to protect public funds from fraud and unnecessary expenditures.   \\par\n\\pard\\ltrpar\\nowidctlpar\\fi720\\sl480\\slmult1\\qj\\'a7 2.
