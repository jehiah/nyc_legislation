The commissioner shall transmit to the commissioner of parks and recreation a copy of any permit for tree removal pursuant to section 27-148 within ten days after such permit was issued.\n    \t�4.  Section 27-148 of such code is amended by adding thereto a new subdivision (i) to read as follows:\n\t(i)  Tree removal permits: for the removal of one or more trees, as provided pursuant to section 18-132 and section 26-253 of the code.\n    \t�5.
