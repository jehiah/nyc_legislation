Title 10 of the administrative code of the city of New York is hereby amended by adding new section 10-138, to read as follows:\n\tSection 10-138 Distribution of a Model Code of Conduct to participants in youth sports programs. a. Legislative findings and intent. Participation in youth sports programs should be a rewarding experience. Through sports programs, our youth learn the importance of teamwork, cooperation, effort, discipline and commitment. Furthermore, regular physical activity is the cornerstone of an active and healthy lifestyle. Unfortunately, good sportsmanship is sometimes lacking on the part of coaches, parents, players, spectators and other persons involved in youth sports programs, resulting in the creation of a hostile environment for participants. The City Council finds that in order to realize the full potential and value of youth sports programs, participants in such programs should follow a Code of Conduct that reflects principles of good sportsmanship at all youth sports events. Furthermore, the City Council finds that organizations that administer youth sports programs should have the option of banning coaches, parents, players, spectators and other participants in youth sports programs from attending youth sports events if they engage in certain egregious behavior at such events. Additionally, such organizations should have the option of requiring individuals to complete some form of anger management counseling before being allowed to resume attendance at youth sports events.\n   \tb.

For purposes of this section:\n\t(1) The term \"youth\" shall mean any person under the age of eighteen.\n      (2) The term \"organization\" shall mean any individual, firm, partnership, trust, association, corporation or other entity.\n      (3) The term \"youth sports event\" shall mean a competition, practice or instructional event involving one or more youth sports teams, where such youth sports teams utilize city facilities and/or receive city funding.\n      c. Any organization that administers a youth sports program that utilizes city facilities and/or receives city funding shall distribute the following Model Code of Conduct or a similar Code of Conduct containing guidelines for conduct of behavior to be observed at youth sports events to all coaches, parents and players participating in such sports program: \nModel Code of Conduct\n1.
