  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection 1.  Declaration of legislative findings and intent.  Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides in pertinent part that \"[n]o person in the United States shall on the ground of race, color or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal assistance.\"  The United States Department of Justice and the Department of Health and Human Services have stated that all recipients of federal funding must take reasonable steps to ensure meaningful access to the information and services they provide and that failure to do so may amount to a violation of Title VI.\n\tIt is and has been the policy of the City of New York to oppose all forms of discrimination, especially when such discrimination could undermine the welfare of New York City residents.  Individuals should not face obstacles to receiving social services for which they may be eligible because they do not speak English.  The purpose of this local law is to ensure that persons eligible for social services receive them and to avoid the possibility that a person who attempts to access services will face discrimination based upon the language s/he speaks.  \n\t� 2.  Title 8 of the administrative code of the city of New York is hereby amended by adding a new chapter 10 to read as follows:\nCHAPTER 10\nEQUAL ACCESS TO HUMAN SERVICES\n\n� 8-1001\t\tShort title.\n� 8-1002\t\tDefinitions.\n� 8-1003\t\tLanguage assistance services.\n� 8-1004\t\tTranslation of documents.\n� 8-1005\t\tNotices. \n� 8-1006\t\tScreening and training.\n� 8-1007\t\tRecordkeeping. \n� 8-1008\t\tImplementation.\n� 8-1009\t\tRules. \t\n� 8-1010\t\tMiscellaneous. \n� 8-1011\t\tSeverability. \t\n\t� 8-1001  Short title. This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the \"Equal Access to Human Services Act of 2003.\"\n\t� 8-1002 Definitions.

Benefits or services offered or provided at agency offices;\n\t2.  Benefits or services provided by agency contractors to provide employment services in connection with participation of individuals engaged in activities required by sections 335 through 336-c of the social services law; \n\t3.
