(i) Within ninety days of the effective date of this section, the commissioner of citywide administrative services shall establish specifications for all lithographic printing where oil is used in its ink that is procured or performed by the department or performed by a city agency for itself which requires use of the maximum amount of vegetable oil in the ink that is technologically feasible and results in printing costs that are cost-competitive with printing using petroleum-based inks.\n    \t(ii) Such specifications shall require that such printing be done using inks containing at least the following percentages of vegetable oil: in the case of news inks, forty percent; in the case of sheet-fed inks and forms inks, twenty percent; and in the \ncase of heat-set inks, ten percent; except that where the department determines that the cost of printing with vegetable-based ink is significantly greater than the cost of printing using petroleum-based ink, the department may perform or procure such printing or a city agency may perform such printing for itself using inks containing less than the percentages of vegetable-based inks set forth in this subdivision, until such time as there is no longer a significant difference in cost. A determination made pursuant to this paragraph shall be reviewed at least once each quarter with respect to materials that are printed quarterly or more frequently and prior to performing or procuring the printing of material in substantial quantity that is to be printed only once or is printed at intervals of six months or longer.\n    \t �2.
