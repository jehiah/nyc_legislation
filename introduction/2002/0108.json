  "Text": "By The Speaker (Council Member Miller) and Council Members Addabbo, Brewer, DeBlasio, Jackson, Koppell, Monserrate, Nelson, Perkins, Quinn, Reyna, Stewart, Serrano, Avella, Seabrook, Gioia, Gentile, Weprin, Moskowitz, Liu; and Council Members Gennaro, Recchia, Sanders, Vallone, Gerson, Yassky, Katz and McMahon\n\nBe it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\tSection 1.  Declaration of legislative findings and intent.  The Council finds and declares that forests play a vital role in regulating the global climate, purifying the air and protecting watersheds.  Forests contain at least half of the world's animal and plant species, many of which contribute to the production of medicines and food, and many more species that have not yet been discovered or evaluated for their beneficial uses.  Throughout the world, communities depend on healthy forests for their economic value, including their role in sustaining fisheries and providing recreational opportunities.  Regrettably, deforestation continues to displace indigenous people who live in forest areas, resulting in the destruction of their cultures.  In addition, poorly managed logging operations degrade and destroy forests, increase the threat of forest fires and enable development to spread in forest lands, some of which are of such ecological significance that they should never be subject to commercial logging. \n      Recognizing the role that forests play in the global environment, the New York State Finance Law requires purchasing restrictions by both the state and local governments in relation to the procurement of tropical hardwoods and tropical hardwood products.  The Council, however, finds that newly marketed building materials such as reclaimed wood, particle board from agricultural residue and recycled plastic lumber are environmentally preferable alternatives to the procurement of wood products.  Pursuant to this legislation, the City, abiding by standards dedicated to improving forest management and conservation, will use an independent, third-party forest certification procedure, with a separate chain-of-custody certification linking forest products to their forest of origin.  This procedure will enable the City to know whether it is purchasing wood products that originate from responsibly managed forests.  Accordingly, the City of New York, using its power as a market participant, shall engage in a policy of supporting ecologically sound forestry practices in its procurement of wood products. \n\t�2.  Title 6 of the administrative code of the city of New York is hereby amended by adding a new section 6-128, to read as follows:\nSection 6-128. a.  For purposes of this section only, the following terms shall have the following meanings:\n\t(1) \"Accreditation Body\" means an authoritative body that verifies and gives formal recognition that a body or person is competent to carry out specific tasks.\n\t(2) \"Biobased Material\" means material derived from agricultural residue, \nincluding, but not limited to, wheat straw, corn stover, rice straw and bagasse from fiber crops that are harvested at least annually.\n\t(3) \"Building Material\" means supplies, fixtures and equipment that become part of or are annexed to any building or structure constructed, erected, altered, or repaired, including but not limited to, buildings, boardwalks, benches, bicycle paths, walkways, decking and piers.\n\t(4) \"Chain of custody certification\" means a process that provides documentary evidence verifying that a given wood product is derived from a certified forest of origin.\n\t(5) \"Contract\" means any written agreement, purchase order or instrument whereby the City is committed to expend or does expend funds in return for work, labor, services, supplies, equipment, materials, or any combination of the foregoing.\n\t(6) \"Contracting agency\" means any office, department, administration, authority, \ndivision, bureau, board, commission, corporation, institution or agency of government, the expenses of which are paid in whole or in part from the city treasury.\n\t(7) \"Environmentally preferable building material\" means one or more of the following:\n(i)\twood products for building materials or furniture articles originating in forests certified  through a forest certification program pursuant to the requirements of this section;\n(ii)\treclaimed wood products;\n(iii) biobased materials; or\n(iv) recycled plastic and other recycled materials.\n\t(8) \"Forest certification program\" means an independent, third-party initiative that provides, through one or more organizations, formal affiliates or contracted agents, an integrated package of services including, but not limited to:  development and application of standards to assess and certify forest management; accreditation of certifiers; and awarding of certification by the program's accredited forest certifiers.\n\t(9) \"Forest Certifier\" means an independent, third-party organization that conducts comprehensive assessments of environmentally and socially responsible forest management practices and that is accredited by an independent, third-party accreditation body.\n\t(10)\"Furniture article\" means those movable articles: (i) used to support people or things; and, (ii) other functional or decorative products, including, but not limited to, beds, bookcases, chairs, chests, tables, dressers, desks and sofas.  The term does not include lamps or lighting fixtures. \n\t(11)\"Reclaimed wood products\" means wood legally salvaged from the following sources: buildings that are not historically significant; dead, fallen, diseased or nuisance trees from urban, private and government properties; usable wood safely reclaimed or diverted from landfills; wood by-products from secondary manufacturers; and discarded pallets.\n\t(12) \"Recycled material\" means material that meets the minimum post-consumer material content requirements specified in title fifty-five, chapter eight, section three of the city of New York's rules and regulations.\n\t(13)  \"Third-party\" means not having an equity interest in the land or the management of the forests or chain of custody operation being evaluated, and independent from any forest trade association.\n\t(14)\"Wood product\" means any wood products for a building material or furniture article, wholesale or retail, in any form, including but not limited to veneer, furniture, cabinets, paneling, moldings, doorskins, joinery or sawnwood.\n\tb. Contracting agencies shall for the purposes of the procurement of wood products for a building material or furniture article seek to maximize the use of environmentally preferable building materials by whatever means practicable and authorized by law. \n\tc.   (1) No contracting agency shall purchase or enter into a contract that requires the use of a wood product for a building material or furniture article unless the contractor provides certificates, labels and/or other documents ensuring that such product's chain-of-custody and/or its forest of origin have been certified through an eligible forest certification program pursuant to this section, and a statement that the information provided is true and accurate. \n\t(2)  The requirements of subdivision c, paragraph 1 shall not apply: to reclaimed wood products; or \n(i) when the Landmarks Preservation Commission determines that the use of a particular species is necessary for historical restoration; or\n(iii)\twhere the inclusion or application of such provisions will violate or be inconsistent with the terms and conditions of a grant, subvention or contract of the United States government or the instructions of an authorized representative of any such agency with respect to any such grant, subvention or contract.\n\t(3) A contracting agency may waive the requirements of subdivision c, paragraph 1 of this section with regard to all or a portion of a contract under the following circumstances:\n(i)\twhere the contracting agency finds that no person or entity that is qualified to do business with the city is capable of providing wood products sufficient to meet the particular contract requirements; or\n(ii)\tthe contract is necessary in order to respond to an emergency that \nendangers the public health and safety and no entity that complies with the requirements of this section capable of responding to the emergency is immediately available; or\n(iii)\twhere the contracting agency determines that there is not a sufficient supply of certified wood products and completion of the contract will result in substantial delay; or\n\t(iv)\twhere the inclusion or application of such requirements results in a substantial cost increase to the city.  \n\tAll waivers pursuant to this subdivision shall be in writing, shall include the specific reason for the waiver and all information upon which the waiver is based, and shall become part of the contract file of the contracting agency.  Notwithstanding any waiver, the contracting agency shall take every reasonable measure to contract with a contractor who best satisfies the requirements of this section.\n\t(1) Within sixty days of the effective date of this section, the mayor shall direct\nthe appropriate department or agency that he or she so designates to create a list of eligible forest certification programs.\n\t(2)\tWithin two hundred forty days of the effective date of this section, the designated department or agency shall promulgate rules and regulations in accordance with the administrative procedure act of the charter of the city of New York, specifying the information that forest certification programs  must provide in order to be deemed eligible for the purposes of fulfilling the eligibility requirements of this subdivision.

Declaration of legislative findings and intent.  The Council finds and declares that forests play a vital role in regulating the global climate, purifying the air and protecting watersheds.  Forests contain at least half of the world\\rquote s animal and plant species, many of which contribute to the production of medicines and food, and many more species that have not yet been discovered or evaluated for their beneficial uses.  Throughout the world, communities depend on healthy forests for their economic value, including their role in sustaining fisheries and providing recreational opportunities.  Regrettably, deforestation continues to displace indigenous people who live in forest areas, resulting in the destruction of their cultures.  In addition, poorly managed logging operations degrade and destroy forests, increase the threat of forest fires and enable development to spread in forest lands, some of which are of such ecological significance that they should never be subject to commercial logging. \\par\n\\pard\\ltrpar\\fi720\\sl480\\slmult1\\tx0\\tx720\\tx1440\\tx2160\\tx2880\\tx3600\\tx4320\\tx5040\\tx5760\\tx6480\\tx7200\\tx7920\\tqr\\tx8640 Recognizing the role that forests play in the global environment, the New York State Finance Law requires purchasing restrictions by both the state and local governments in relation to the procurement of tropical hardwoods and tropical hardwood products.  The Council, however, finds that newly marketed building materials such as reclaimed wood, particle board from agricultural residue and recycled plastic lumber are environmentally preferable alternatives to the procurement of wood products.  Pursuant to this legislation, the City, abiding by standards dedicated to improving forest management and conservation, will use an independent, third-party forest certification procedure, with a separate chain-of-custody certification linking forest products to their forest of origin.  This procedure will enable the City to know whether it is purchasing wood products that originate from responsibly managed forests.  Accordingly, the City of New York, using its power as a market participant, shall engage in a policy of supporting ecologically sound forestry practices in its procurement of wood products. \\par\n\\pard\\ltrpar\\sl480\\slmult1\\tx0\\tx720\\tx1440\\tx2160\\tx2880\\tx3600\\tx4320\\tx5040\\tx5760\\tx6480\\tx7200\\tx7920\\tqr\\tx8640\\tab\\ul\\'a72.
