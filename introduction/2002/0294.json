  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n            Section 1.  Subdivision a of section 20-223 of the administrative code of the city of  New York is amended to read as follows:\n            a.  \"Sidewalk caf�\" shall mean a portion of [an eating or drinking place] a restaurant operated under permit from the department of health and mental hygiene, located on a public sidewalk, that is either an enclosed or unenclosed sidewalk caf�.\n            � 2.  Subdivisions a and b of section 20-224 of the administrative code of the city of New York, subdivision b as amended by local law number 70 for the year 1990, are amended to read as follows:\n            a.  Any person owning, leasing, managing or operating [an apartment house, apartment hotel, store, caf�,] a restaurant under permit from the department of health and mental hygiene [or hotel] upon property which abuts upon any street within the city may maintain or operate upon the sidewalk of such street in an area immediately adjacent to its premises, a sidewalk caf�, provided that such sidewalk caf� shall be [licensed] granted a license and a revocable consent by the commissioner.\n            b.  The commissioner, consistent with the provisions of this subchapter and the applicable provisions of the zoning resolution, shall establish such rules, regulations, terms and conditions as the commissioner deems proper in respect to the granting and issuance of such licenses and revocable consents, priorities or rights between applicants for a license covering the same space, and operation (including hours of operation) and maintenance of any sidewalk caf�, to ensure good order and to prevent undue obstruction of the sidewalk, which shall have the force and effect of law.  A license to operate a sidewalk caf� shall be issued after the review and approval of a petition for a revocable consent to construct and operate such sidewalk caf� pursuant to the provisions of section 20-225, 20-226 or 20-227 of this subchapter.  The operator of a sidewalk caf� under license from the commissioner shall cause the boundary of the area licensed as a sidewalk caf� to be marked in a manner prescribed under rules promulgated by the commissioner.\n            � 3.  Subdivision d of section 20-224 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 70 for the year 1990, is amended to read as follows:\n            d.  The fee for such license shall be at the rate of [twenty-seven dollars for each table; provided; however, that in no case shall there be a fee of less than one hundred thirty-five dollars for each such license] five hundred and ten dollars for a two-year license.  [Each table shall be designed to seat no more than six persons.]  Such license fee shall be in addition to any fee imposed, pursuant to rules of the commissioner, upon approval of a petition for a revocable consent, or a renewal of such revocable consent, to construct and operate a sidewalk caf� or any other applicable fee.\n            � 4.  Subdivision e of section 20-224 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\n            e.  A licensee must provide waiter or waitress service to patrons in the sidewalk caf� if alcohol is served.  If no alcohol is served at the restaurant, a licensee must provide adequate service to maintain tables in the sidewalk cafe and the adjacent sidewalk in a manner that ensures good order and cleanliness.\n            � 5.  Subdivision a of section 20-225 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 70 for the year 1990, is amended to read as follows:\n            a.  The petition shall be in such form as prescribed by the department [after consultation with the department of city planning, the department of transportation, the department of environmental protection, and the landmarks preservation commission].  The petition shall be filed with the department which, within five days of the filing of such petition, shall forward copies thereof to [the department of transportation,] the department of city planning, the department of environmental protection and the landmarks preservation commission for review pursuant to subdivision b of this section.  The department shall forward copies of the petition, within five days of the filing of such petition, to the speaker of the council and to the council member in whose district the caf� is proposed to be located, for informational purposes.\n            � 6.  Subdivisions e, f and g of section 20-225 of the administrative code of the city of New York, subdivision e as amended and subdivisions f and g as added by local law number 70 for the year 1990, are amended to read as follows:\n            e.  The community board shall, not later than [sixty] forty-five days after receipt of such petition, either (i) notify the public of the petition in a manner specified by the city planning commission, conduct a public hearing thereon and submit a written recommendation to the department [of transportation] and to the council or (ii) waive by a written statement its public hearing and recommendation on such petition, and submit such statement to the department [of transportation] and to the council.\n            f.  Within [sixty] thirty days after the expiration of the [sixty-day] forty-five day period allowed for the filing of a recommendation or waiver by the community board, the department [of transportation] shall (i) hold a public hearing on the petition, (ii) approve the petition, disapprove it or approve it with modifications, and (iii) file with the council any such decision to approve or approve with modifications, together with the petition.  If within the time period provided, the department [of transportation] fails to take the actions on a petition provided for in the preceding sentence, the petition shall be deemed to have been denied.  For a period of not less than fifteen calendar days prior to the date of such public hearing, the petitioner shall post notice of the public hearing in a place conspicuous to public view at the location of the proposed sidewalk caf�.  At least fifteen days prior to the date of such hearing, the department [of transportation] shall give notice to the community board for the district in which the caf� is proposed to be located, to the president of the borough in which the caf� is proposed to be located and to the council member in whose district the cafe is proposed to be located.  Not less than five calendar days prior to the date of any such hearing, notice of the hearing shall be published in the City Record and in one newspaper of local circulation in the community where the caf� is proposed to be located.  No other notice requirements shall apply to hearings for revocable consents for sidewalk cafes.\n            g.  Within twenty days of the date the petition is received by the council pursuant to subdivision f of this section, the council may resolve by the majority vote of all council members to review the petition.  If the council does not so resolve, the approval of the petition by the department [of transportation] shall be forwarded to the mayor for approval pursuant to subdivision i of this section.\n            � 7.  Subdivisions i and j of section 20-225 of the administrative code of the city of New York, subdivision i as amended and subdivision j as added by local law number 70 for the year 1990, are amended to read as follows:\n            i.  The consent shall be for such term and upon such conditions as may be provided in the approval of the petition by the department [of transportation], as such approval may be modified by action of the council pursuant to subdivision h of this section, but shall be revocable at any time by the department [of transportation].  The separate and additional approval of the mayor shall be necessary to its validity.\n            j.  Consents for sidewalk cafes shall provide for fees to be paid annually to the city during the continuance of the consent.  Such fees shall be calculated pursuant to a formula established by rule or by local law, which shall apply uniformly to all consents for enclosed sidewalk cafes.

For purposes of this section, any such violation by any license holder at a place of business shall be included in determining the number of violations by any subsequent license holder at the same place of business unless the subsequent license holder provides the department with adequate documentation demonstrating that the subsequent license holder acquired the premises or business through an arm's length transaction as defined in subdivision f of this section and that the sale or lease was not conducted, in whole or in part, for the purpose of permitting the original license holder to avoid the effect of violations on the premises.
