  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\nSection 1.  This local law shall be known and may be cited as the New York City Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Act of 2003.\n§2.  Local law number 38 for the year 1999 is hereby REPEALED.\n§3. Local Law number 1 for the year 1982 is hereby REPEALED.\n§4.  Local law number 50 for the year 1972 is hereby REPEALED.\n§5.  Subchapter 2 of chapter 2 of title 27 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new article 14 to read as follows:\nArticle 14\nLead Poisoning Prevention and Control\n§27-2056.1  Statement of Findings and Purposes.\n§27-2056.2  Definitions.\n§27-2056.3  Owners'  Responsibility to  Remediate.\n§27-2056.4  Owners'  Responsibility to Notify Occupants and Investigate.\n§27-2056.5  Presumption.\n§27-2056.6  Violation in a Dwelling Unit.\n§27-2056.7  Audit and Inspection by Department following Commissioner’s order to abate.\n§27-2056.8  Violation in a Dwelling Unit Upon Turnover.\n§27-2056.9  Department Inspections.\n§27-2056.10  Department Implementation and Enforcement.\n§27-2056.11  Work Practices.\n§27-2056.12  Reporting.\n§27-2056.13  Transmittal of Violations to the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.\n§27-2056.14  Request to the Department from the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to Execute an Order Pursuant to § 17-147 of the Administrative Code.\n§27-2056.15  Waiver of Benefit Void.\n§27-2056.16  Exemption for Emergency Conditions.\n§27-2056.17  Record Keeping Requirements.\n§ 27-2056.18 Application of this article based on age of child.\n\n§27-2056.1  Statement of findings and purposes.  The council finds that lead poisoning from paint containing lead is a preventable childhood disease and a public health crisis.  The council further finds that the hazard in dwellings that may occur from paint containing lead is subject to many factors, such as the age of a building and its maintenance.  The Council also finds and declares that City government must focus on primary prevention as the essential tool to combat childhood lead poisoning and to achieve the goal of preventing children from suffering the adverse health and other effects of exposure to lead-based paint. The pursuit of primary prevention, which means eliminating lead hazards before children are exposed, has been recommended by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and promoted by leading experts in the field as a critical course of action to protect the health of young children. The Council, therefore, declares that resources must be directed to primary prevention, including identifying children who are most at risk. \nThe council recognizes that it cannot legislate a single maintenance standard for all dwellings to eliminate this hazard.  Instead, the council by enacting this article makes it the  responsibility of every owner of a multiple dwelling to investigate dwelling units for lead-based paint hazards and to address such hazards on a case-by-case basis as the conditions may warrant, taking such actions as are necessary to prevent a child from becoming lead poisoned.  Having established this responsibility, the council finds that sufficient information exists to guide owners in making determinations about the existence of lead-based paint hazards.  See, e.g., United States environmental protection agency, “Identification of Dangerous Levels of Lead; Final Rule” Federal Register, Vol. 66, No. 4 ( January 5, 2001); United States department of housing and urban development, “Guidelines for the Evaluation and Control of Lead-Based Paint Hazards in Housing” (June 1995, revised 1997).\nThe New York city department of health and mental hygiene has reported for the year 2001 that among children tested, 5,638 were newly identified with elevated blood lead levels of 10 micrograms per deciliter or above.  The New York city department of health and mental hygiene has reported for the year 2001 that among children tested,  653 were newly identified at or above the department’s environmental intervention blood lead level, which is a blood lead level equal to or exceeding 20 micrograms per deciliter in a single test or two reported blood lead levels between 15 and 19 micrograms per deciliter at least three months apart, and has also reported an overall incidence of 931 children tested with blood lead levels equal to or exceeding 20 micrograms per deciliter.  When a child is identified with environmental intervention blood lead levels, the city is obligated to investigate potential sources of the lead poisoning, incurring the expense of an environmental investigation and often times also incurring the expense of medical treatment and remedial education, if necessary.   The council finds that these blood lead levels among New York city children constitute a severe health crisis and has established as its goal the elimination of childhood lead poisoning by the year 2010.\nIn addition, the department of health and mental hygiene has reported for the year 2001 that only 29% of children in New York city are tested both at age one and age two for the disease of lead poisoning even though the testing of all children at age one and age two is mandatory under state law.  The council finds that improved screening among these children is critical since children at these ages are at greatest risk for lead poisoning. The council declares that it is reasonable and necessary to increase the rate of blood-lead testing.  This local law requires the department of health and mental hygiene to report to the council on progress toward increasing screening rates and reducing the incidence rates of children newly identified with elevated blood lead levels.\nThe council further finds that the administration and enforcement of the City’s lead poisoning prevention programs can be better coordinated.  While it is intended that the department of housing preservation and development remain the agency responsible for the implementation and enforcement of this article, it is also intended that the department of health and mental hygiene shall have a significant role in the promulgation and interpretation of rules and in the development of necessary procedures pursuant to this article.\n§27-2056.2  Definitions.  Whenever used in this article the following terms shall have the following meanings:\n(1)  “Chewable surface” shall mean a protruding interior window sill in a dwelling unit in a multiple dwelling where a child of applicable age resides and which is readily accessible to such child. “Chewable surface” shall also mean any other type of interior edge or protrusion in a dwelling unit in a multiple dwelling, such as a rail or stair, where there is evidence that such other edge or protrusion has been chewed or where an occupant has notified the owner that a child of applicable age who resides in that multiple dwelling has mouthed or chewed such edge or protrusion.\n(2)  “Common area” shall mean a portion of a multiple dwelling that is not within a dwelling unit and is regularly used by occupants for access to and egress from any dwelling unit within such multiple dwelling.  \n(3)  “Deteriorated subsurface” shall mean an unstable or unsound painted subsurface, an indication of which can be observed through a visual inspection, including, but not limited to, rotted or decayed wood, or wood or plaster that has been subject to moisture or disturbance.\n(4) “Friction Surface” shall mean any painted surface that touches or is in contact with another surface, such that the two surfaces are capable of relative motion and abrade, scrape, or bind when in relative motion.   Friction surfaces shall include, but not be limited to, window frames and jambs, doors, and hinges.\n(5)  “Impact Surface” shall mean any interior painted surface that shows evidence, such as marking, denting, or chipping, that it is subject to damage by repeated sudden force, such as certain parts of door frames, moldings, or baseboards.\n(6)  “Lead-based paint hazard” shall mean any condition in a dwelling or dwelling unit that causes exposure to lead from lead-contaminated dust, from lead-based paint that is peeling, or from lead-based paint that is present on chewable surfaces, deteriorated subsurfaces, friction surfaces, or impact surfaces that would result in adverse human health effects.\n(7)  “Lead-based paint” shall mean paint or other similar surface coating material containing 1.0 milligrams of lead per square centimeter or greater, as determined by laboratory analysis, or by an x-ray fluorescence analyzer.  If an x-ray fluorescence analyzer is used, readings shall be corrected for substrate bias when necessary as specified by the performance characteristic sheets  released by the United States environmental protection agency and the United States department of housing and urban development for the specific x-ray fluorescence analyzer used.  X-ray fluorescence readings shall be classified as positive, negative or inconclusive in accordance with the United States department of housing and urban development “Guidelines for the Evaluation and Control of Lead-Based Paint Hazards in Housing” (June 1995, revised 1997) and the performance characteristic sheets released by the  United States environmental protection agency and the United States department of housing and urban development for the specific x-ray fluorescence analyzer used.  X-ray fluorescence readings that fall within the inconclusive zone, as determined by the performance characteristic sheets, shall be confirmed by laboratory analysis of paint chips, results shall be reported in milligrams of lead per square centimeter and the measure of such laboratory analysis shall be definitive.  If laboratory analysis is used to determine lead content, results shall be reported in milligrams of lead per square centimeter.  Where the surface area of a paint chip sample cannot be accurately measured or if an accurately measured paint chip sample cannot be removed, a laboratory analysis may be reported in percent by weight.  In such case, lead-based paint shall mean any paint or other similar surface-coating material containing more than 0.5% of metallic lead, based on the non-volatile content of the paint or other similar surface-coating material. \n (8)  “Lead-contaminated dust” shall mean dust containing lead at a mass per area concentration of 40 or more micrograms per square foot on a floor, 250 or more  micrograms per square foot on window sills, and 400 or more micrograms per square foot on window wells, or such more stringent standards as may be adopted by the  department of health and mental hygiene.\n(9)  “Lead-contaminated dust clearance test” shall mean a test for lead-contaminated dust on floors, window wells, and window sills in a dwelling,  that is made in accordance with section 27-2056.11 of this article. \n(10)  “Peeling” shall mean that the paint or other surface-coating material is curling, cracking, scaling, flaking, blistering, chipping, chalking or loose in any manner, such that a space or pocket of air is behind a portion thereof or such that the paint is not completely adhered to the underlying surface.\n(11)  “Remediation” or “Remediate” shall mean the reduction or elimination of a lead-based paint hazard through the wet scraping and repainting, removal, encapsulation, enclosure, or replacement of lead-based paint, or other method approved by the commissioner of health and mental hygiene.\n(12)  “Rule” or “rules” shall mean a rule or rules promulgated pursuant to section 1043 of the New York city charter.\n(13) “Turnover” shall mean the occupancy of a dwelling unit subsequent to the termination of a tenancy and the vacatur by a prior tenant of such dwelling unit.\n(14)  “Underlying defect” shall mean a physical condition in a dwelling or dwelling unit that is causing or has caused paint to peel or a painted surface to deteriorate or fail, such as a structural or plumbing failure that allows water to intrude into a dwelling or dwelling unit. \n(15) “Window” shall mean the non-glass parts of a window, including but not limited to any window sash, window well, window jamb, window sill, or window molding.\n§27-2056.3 Owners' Responsibility to Remediate.  The existence of a lead-based paint hazard in any multiple dwelling where a child of applicable age resides is hereby declared to constitute a condition dangerous to life and health.  An owner shall take action to prevent the reasonably foreseeable occurrence of such a condition and shall expeditiously remediate such condition and any underlying defect, when such underlying defect exists, consistent with the work practices established pursuant to section 27-2056.11 of this article, except where lead-contaminated dust is present in such multiple dwelling and the department of health and mental hygiene has made a determination pursuant to paragraph six of subdivision c of section 27-2056.10 of this article.  \n§27-2056.4.  Owners'  Responsibility to Notify Occupants and to Investigate.  a.  In any dwelling unit in a multiple dwelling erected prior to January first, nineteen hundred sixty where a child of applicable age resides, and in any dwelling unit in a multiple dwelling erected on or after January first, nineteen hundred sixty and before January first, nineteen hundred seventy-eight where a child of applicable age resides and the owner has actual knowledge of the presence of lead-based paint, and in common areas of such multiple dwellings, the owner shall cause an investigation to be made for peeling paint, chewable surfaces, deteriorated subsurfaces, friction surfaces and impact surfaces. Such investigation shall be undertaken at least once a year and more often if necessary, such as when, in the exercise of reasonable care, an owner knows or should have known of a condition that is reasonably foreseeable to cause a lead-based paint hazard, or an occupant makes a complaint concerning a condition that is likely to cause a lead-based paint hazard or requests an inspection, or the department issues a notice of violation or orders the correction of a violation that is likely to cause a lead-based paint hazard.   The owner shall ascertain whether a child resides therein pursuant to the requirements of this section.\nb.  No occupant in a dwelling unit in such multiple dwelling shall refuse or unreasonably fail to provide accurate and truthful information regarding the residency of a child of applicable age therein, nor shall an occupant refuse access to the owner at a reasonable time and upon reasonable prior notice to any part of the  dwelling unit  for the purpose of investigation and repair of lead-based paint hazards.\nc.  All leases offered to tenants or prospective tenants in such multiple dwellings must contain a notice, conspicuously set forth therein, which advises tenants of the obligations of the owner and tenant as set forth in this section.  Such notice must be in a manner approved by the department, the content of which shall, at a minimum, be in English and Spanish.  The owner of such multiple dwelling shall provide the occupant of such multiple dwelling with the pamphlet described in subdivision b of section  17-179 of this  code.\nd.  (1) The owner of such a multiple dwelling shall provide to an occupant of a dwelling unit at the signing of a lease, including a renewal lease, if any, or upon any agreement to lease, or at the commencement of occupancy if there is no lease, a notice in English and Spanish, the form and content of which shall be approved by the department of health and mental hygiene, inquiring whether a child of applicable age resides or will reside therein.  If there is a lease, such notice shall be included in such lease or be attached as a rider to such lease.  Such notice shall be completed by the occupant at the time of such signing of a lease, including a renewal lease, if any, or such agreement to lease, or at such commencement of occupancy.\n(2) Where an occupant has responded to the notice provided by the owner pursuant to paragraph one of subdivision d of this section by indicating that no child of applicable age resides therein, during the period between the date of such response and the delivery of the notice provided by the owner pursuant to subdivision e of this section during the immediately following year the occupant shall have the responsibility to inform the owner of  any child of applicable age that comes to reside therein during such period.  In the event such occupant fails to inform the owner of such child as required by this paragraph, and the owner does not otherwise have actual knowledge that such child is residing in the dwelling unit, the presumption provided for in section 27-2056.5 of this article shall not apply in any action to recover damages for personal injury caused by contact with or exposure to lead-based paint or lead-contaminated dust.\n         e.  (1)  Each year, an owner of a multiple dwelling erected prior to January first, nineteen hundred sixty shall, no earlier than January first and no later than January sixteenth, except as provided for in subparagraph iii of paragraph two of this subdivision, present to the occupant of each dwelling unit in such multiple dwelling a notice inquiring as to whether a child of applicable age resides therein.  Such notice, the form and content of which shall be approved by the department of health and mental hygiene, shall be presented as provided for in paragraph two of this subdivision, and shall be in English and Spanish. \n\t(2)  The owner may present the notice required by paragraph one of this subdivision by delivering said notice by any one of the following methods:\n (i)  by first class mail, addressed to the occupant of the dwelling unit;\n(ii)  by hand delivery to the occupant of the dwelling unit;\n(iii) by enclosure with the January rent bill, if such rent bill is delivered after December fifteenth but no later than January sixteenth; or\n\t(iv)  by delivering said notice in conjunction with the annual notice required pursuant to section 17-123 of  this code and the rules of the department of health and mental hygiene pertaining to the installation of window guards.\n\t(3)  (i)\t  Upon receipt of such notice the occupant shall have the responsibility to deliver by February fifteenth of that year, a written response to the owner indicating whether or not a child of applicable age resides therein. If, subsequent to delivery of such notice, the owner does not receive such written response by February fifteenth, and does not otherwise have actual knowledge as to whether a child of applicable age resides therein, then the owner shall at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice inspect that occupant’s dwelling unit to ascertain the residency of a child of applicable age and, when necessary, conduct an investigation in order to make that determination.  Where, between February sixteenth and March first of that year, the owner has made reasonable attempts to gain access to a dwelling unit to determine if a child of applicable age resides in that dwelling unit and was unable to gain access, the owner shall notify the department of health and mental hygiene of that circumstance.\n\t(ii)\tWhere an occupant has responded to the notice provided by the owner pursuant to subparagraph (i) of this paragraph by indicating that no child of applicable age resides therein, during the period between the date of such response and the delivery of the notice provided by the owner pursuant to this subdivision during the immediately following year the occupant shall have the responsibility to inform the owner of any child of applicable age that comes to reside therein during such period.  In the event such occupant fails to inform the owner of such child as required by this paragraph, and the owner does not otherwise have actual knowledge that such child is residing in the dwelling unit, the presumption provided for in section 27-2056.5 of this article shall not apply in any action to recover damages for personal injury caused by contact with or exposure to lead-based paint or lead contaminated dust.\n\t(4)  For calendar year two thousand four, an owner shall be deemed to have satisfied the provisions of paragraphs one through three of this subdivision if such owner delivers or has already delivered to each dwelling unit where a child under six years of age resides a notice identical or substantially similar to that required to have been delivered in calendar year two thousand three, (i) in the  same manner as was required in calendar year two thousand three, and (ii) during the same periods of time in calendar year two thousand four as such notice was required to have been delivered during calendar year two thousand three. \nf.  The owner shall inform the occupant in writing of the results of an investigation undertaken pursuant to this section and shall provide a copy of any such report received or generated by an investigation.  The owner shall retain a copy of each investigation report, for ten years from the date of such report and such report shall be made available to the department on request and shall be transferred by the owner to the owner’s successor in title.\ng.  Any owner who violates the provisions of this section, or the rules promulgated hereunder, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to five hundred dollars or imprisonment for up to six months or both.  In addition, any violation of this section shall subject the owner to a civil penalty of not more than one thousand five hundred dollars per violation.\nh.\tThe department may, at its discretion, perform sample audits to determine compliance with the requirements of this section.\n\t§27-2056.5 Presumption.  a.  In any multiple dwelling erected prior to January 1, 1960, it shall be presumed that the paint or other similar surface-coating material in  any dwelling unit where a child of applicable age resides or in the common areas is lead-based paint.  The presumption established by this section may be rebutted by the owner of the dwelling or dwelling unit by submitting to the department a sworn written statement by the owner supported by lead-based paint testing or sampling results, a sworn written statement by the person who performed the testing if performed by an employee or agent of the owner, and such other proof as the department may require.  Testing performed to rebut the presumption may only be performed by a person who has been certified as an inspector or risk assessor in accordance with subparts L and Q of part 745 of title 40 of the code of federal regulations or any successor regulations.  The determination as to whether such proof is adequate to rebut the presumption established by this section shall be made by the department.\nb.  The owner of a dwelling or a dwelling unit may apply to the department to have such dwelling or dwelling unit exempted from the presumption contained in subdivision a of this section when either (i) an inspection for lead-based paint in such dwelling or dwelling unit, performed in accordance with section 745.227 of title 40 of the code of federal regulations, or any successor regulation, has determined that there is no lead-based paint present in such dwelling or dwelling unit, or (ii) substantial alterations have been made to such dwelling or dwelling unit and such alterations have resulted in the  removal or permanent covering of all lead-based paint in that dwelling or dwelling unit.

When entering a dwelling unit in a multiple dwelling constructed prior to January 1, 1960 for the purpose of investigating the existence of any violation of this code, the department shall make diligent efforts to ascertain whether a child of applicable age resides therein and shall request from the occupant an acknowledgement as to whether such a child resides in the dwelling unit.  Whenever a child of applicable age resides in a dwelling unit, the department shall immediately perform a room-by-room inspection of the dwelling unit and record for each room in a report of such inspection whether the paint or other similar surface-coating material in each room is peeling or intact.  For each room where peeling paint is found, the department shall also inspect for evidence of an underlying defect and shall indicate on the inspection report the peeling paint’s location within the room, the condition of the subsurface below it, and the location of any underlying defect.  When performing such inspection, the department need only inspect those portions of the dwelling unit where furniture or other furnishings do not obstruct the view of a surface, except when there is visible evidence that causes the department to believe that the obstructed surface has peeling paint. Where, upon conducting an inspection, the department determines the existence of a condition constituting a violation of this article, the department shall serve a notice of violation within ten additional days.  \nb.  In any dwelling unit in a multiple dwelling erected prior to January 1, 1960 where a child of applicable age resides, the department shall conduct an inspection pursuant to subdivision a of this section no later than ten days after the department's receipt of a complaint describing peeling paint, or a deteriorated subsurface or underlying defect in the dwelling unit.

Section 27-2115 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new subdivision l to read as follows:\n(l)(1)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when the department  serves a notice of violation to correct and certify a condition that constitutes a violation of article fourteen of subchapter two of this chapter, the notice of violation shall specify the date by which the violation shall be corrected, which shall be twenty-one days after service of the notice of violation, and the procedure by which the owner, for good cause shown pursuant to this subdivision, may request a postponement.  The notice of violation shall further specify that the violation shall be corrected in accordance with the work practices established in accordance with section 27-2056.11 of this code.  The notice of violation shall be served by personal delivery to a person in charge of the premises or to the person last registered with the department as the owner or agent, or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or by certified mail with proof of delivery, to the person in charge of the premises or to the person last registered with the department as the owner or agent; provided that where a managing agent has registered with the department, such notice of violation shall be served on the managing agent.  Service of the notice of violation shall be deemed completed three days from the date of mailing.  Notification, in a form to be determined by the department, of the issuance of such violation shall be sent simultaneously by regular mail to the occupant at the dwelling unit that is the subject of such notice of violation.  The department may postpone the date by which a violation shall be corrected upon a showing, made within the time set for correction in the notice, that prompt action to correct the violation has been taken but that full correction cannot be completed within the time provided because of serious technical difficulties, inability to obtain necessary materials, funds or labor, inability to gain access to the dwelling unit wherein the violation exists, or such other portion of the building as may be necessary to make the required repair.  Such postponement shall not exceed fourteen days from the date of correction set forth in the notice of violation.  The department may require such other conditions as are deemed necessary to insure correction of the violations within the time set for the postponement.  The department may grant one additional postponement of no more than fourteen days for the reasons authorized by this section so long as the paint or other condition which is the subject of the violation has been stabilized. The department is also authorized to promulgate rules establishing criteria for a postponement of the time to correct for a longer period of time where such postponement is requested because of one or more substantial capital improvements will be made that will, when completed, significantly reduce the presence of lead-based paint in such multiple dwelling or dwelling unit including, but not limited to, a requirement that the paint which is the subject of the violation is stabilized. The department shall provide to the owner and the occupant a written statement signed and dated by the person making such decision setting forth the reasons for each postponement of the date by which a violation shall be corrected or the reason for the denial of such application for a postponement.  Said written statement shall be part of the records of the department. \n(2)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the notice of violation shall direct that the correction of each violation cited therein shall be certified to the department.  Such certification shall be made in writing, under oath by the registered owner, a registered officer or director of a corporate owner or by the registered managing agent.  Such certification shall include a statement that the violation was corrected in compliance with paragraph one of subdivision a of section 27-2056.11 of this code and shall include a copy of the lead-contaminated dust clearance test results.  All certifications shall be delivered to the department and acknowledgment of receipt therefor obtained or shall be mailed to the department by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, no later than five days after the date set for correction, and shall include the date when each violation was corrected.  Such certification of correction shall be supported by a sworn statement by the person who performed the work if performed by an employee or agent of the owner.  A copy of such certification shall be mailed to the complainant by the department not more than twelve full calendar days from the date of receipt of such certification by the department.  Failure to file such certification shall establish a prima facie case that such violation has not been corrected. \n(3)  Whenever the department shall issue a notice of violation to correct a condition that constitutes a violation of section 27-2056.6 of article fourteen of subchapter two of this chapter, the department shall within fourteen days after the date set for the correction of such violation conduct a final inspection to verify that the violation has been corrected.  Where, upon conducting an inspection, the department determines that a violation has not been corrected, the department shall correct such violation within forty-five additional days of such inspection or in such shorter time as is practicable.\n(4)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the department shall not remove a violation from its records nor shall it be deemed that such violation has been corrected unless the records of the department contain written verification that the department has conducted a final inspection of the premises and that such inspection verifies that the violation has been corrected, and copies of lead-contaminated dust clearance test results whenever such tests are required by applicable law, rule or regulation.  A copy of the report of the final inspection of a dwelling unit and the status of the violation shall be mailed or delivered to the occupant and the owner.\n (5)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a person making a false certification of correction  of a violation issued pursuant to article 14 of subchapter 2 of this chapter, in addition to any other civil penalty, shall be subject to a civil penalty of  not less than one thousand dollars nor more than three thousand dollars for each false certification made, recoverable by the department in a civil action brought in a court of competent jurisdiction. If the person making such false certification is an employee of the owner then such owner shall be responsible for such civil penalty.  In addition, any such person making a false certification of correction shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to one thousand dollars or imprisonment for up to one year or both.\n(6)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a person who violates article fourteen of subchapter two of this chapter by failing to correct such violation in accordance with paragraph one of subdivision a of section 27-2056.11 of this code shall be subject to a civil penalty of  two hundred fifty dollars per day for each violation to a maximum of ten thousand dollars from the initial date set for correction in the notice of violation until the date the violation is corrected and certified to the department, and in addition to any civil penalty shall, whenever appropriate, be punished under the provisions of article three of subchapter five of this code.  There shall be a presumption that the condition constituting a violation continues after the service of the notice of violation.  The owner shall be responsible for the correction of all violations noticed pursuant to article fourteen of subchapter two of this chapter, but in an action for civil penalties pursuant to this subdivision may in defense or mitigation of such owner's liability for civil penalties show:\n(i) That the condition which constitutes the violation did not exist at the time the violation was placed; or\n(ii)  That he or she began to correct the condition which constitutes the violation promptly upon discovering it but that full correction could not be completed expeditiously because of serious technical difficulties, inability to obtain necessary materials, funds or labor, or inability to gain access to the dwelling unit wherein the violation exists, or such other portion of the building as might be necessary to make the repair, provided that a postponement was granted pursuant to this subdivision; or\n(iii)  That he or she was unable to obtain a permit or license necessary to correct the violation, provided that diligent and prompt application was made therefor; or\n(iv)  That the violation giving rise to the action was caused by the act of negligence, neglect or abuse of another not in the employ or subject to the direction of the owner, except that the owner shall be precluded from showing in defense or mitigation of such owner's liability for civil penalties evidence of any acts occurring, undertaken, or performed by any predecessor in title prior to the owner taking control of the premises.  Where the aforesaid allegations are made by way of mitigation of penalties, the owner shall show, by competent proof, pertinent financial data and efforts made to obtain necessary materials, funds or labor or to gain access, or to obtain a permit or license and such other evidence as the court may require.\nIf the court finds that sufficient mitigating circumstances exist, it may remit all or part of any penalties arising from the violations, but may condition such remission upon a correction of the violation within a time period fixed by the court.\n (7)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, failure by the department to comply with any time period provided in this section relating to responsibilities of the department shall not render null and void any notice of violation issued by the department or the department of health and mental hygiene pursuant to such article or section, and shall not provide a basis for defense or mitigation of an owner’s liability for civil penalties for violation of such article\n§7.

The council finds that lead poisoning from paint containing lead is a preventable childhood disease and a public health crisis.  The council further finds that the hazard in dwellings that may occur from paint containing lead is subject to many factors, such as the age of a building and its maintenance.  The Council also finds and declares that City government must focus on primary prevention as the essential tool to combat childhood lead poisoning and to achieve the goal of preventing children from suffering the adverse health and other effects of exposure to lead-based paint. The pursuit of primary prevention, which means eliminating lead hazards before children are exposed, has been recommended by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and promoted by leading experts in the field as a critical course of action to protect the health of young children. The Council, therefore, declares that resources must be directed to primary prevention, including identifying children who are most at risk. \\par\nThe council recognizes that it cannot legislate a single maintenance standard for all dwellings to eliminate this hazard.  Instead, the council by enacting this article makes it the  responsibility of every owner of a multiple dwelling to investigate dwelling units for lead-based paint hazards and to address such hazards on a case-by-case basis as the conditions may warrant, taking such actions as are necessary to prevent a child from becoming lead poisoned.  Having established this responsibility, the council finds that sufficient information exists to guide owners in making determinations about the existence of lead-based paint hazards.  See, e.g., United States environmental protection agency, \\ldblquote Identification of Dangerous Levels of Lead; Final Rule\\rdblquote  Federal Register, Vol. 66, No. 4 ( January 5, 2001); United States department of housing and urban development, \\ldblquote Guidelines for the Evaluation and Control of Lead-Based Paint Hazards in Housing\\rdblquote  (June 1995, revised 1997).\\par\nThe New York city department of health and mental hygiene has reported for the year 2001 that among children tested, 5,638 were newly identified with elevated blood lead levels of 10 micrograms per deciliter or above.  The New York city department of health and mental hygiene has reported for the year 2001 that among children tested,  653 were newly identified at or above the department\\rquote s environmental intervention blood lead level, which is a blood lead level equal to or exceeding 20 micrograms per deciliter in a single test or two reported blood lead levels between 15 and 19 micrograms per deciliter at least three months apart, and has also reported an overall incidence of 931 children tested with blood lead levels equal to or exceeding 20 micrograms per deciliter.  When a child is identified with environmental intervention blood lead levels, the city is obligated to investigate potential sources of the lead poisoning, incurring the expense of an environmental investigation and often times also incurring the expense of medical treatment and remedial education, if necessary.   The council finds that these blood lead levels among New York city children constitute a severe health crisis and has established as its goal the elimination of childhood lead poisoning by the year 2010.\\par\nIn addition, the department of health and mental hygiene has reported for the year 2001 that only 29% of children in New York city are tested both at age one and age two for the disease of lead poisoning even though the testing of all children at age one and age two is mandatory under state law.  The council finds that improved screening among these children is critical since children at these ages are at greatest risk for lead poisoning. The council declares that it is reasonable and necessary to increase the rate of blood-lead testing.  This local law requires the department of health and mental hygiene to report to the council on progress toward increasing screening rates and reducing the incidence rates of children newly identified with elevated blood lead levels.\\par\nThe council further finds that the administration and enforcement of the City\\rquote s lead poisoning prevention programs can be better coordinated.  While it is intended that the department of housing preservation and development remain the agency responsible for the implementation and enforcement of this article, it is also intended that the department of health and mental hygiene shall have a significant role in the promulgation and interpretation of rules and in the development of necessary procedures pursuant to this article.\\par\n\\'a727-2056.2  Definitions.

Section 27-2115 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new subdivision l to read as follows:\\par\n\\ul (l)(1)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when the department  serves a notice of violation to correct and certify a condition that constitutes a violation of article fourteen of subchapter two of this chapter, the notice of violation shall specify the date by which the violation shall be corrected, which shall be twenty-one days after service of the notice of violation, and the procedure by which the owner, for good cause shown pursuant to this subdivision, may request a postponement.  The notice of violation shall further specify that the violation shall be corrected in accordance with the work practices established in accordance with section 27-2056.11 of this code.  The notice of violation shall be served by personal delivery to a person in charge of the premises or to the person last registered with the department as the owner or agent, or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or by certified mail with proof of delivery, to the person in charge of the premises or to the person last registered with the department as the owner or agent; provided that where a managing agent has registered with the department, such notice of violation shall be served on the managing agent.  Service of the notice of violation shall be deemed completed three days from the date of mailing.  Notification, in a form to be determined by the department, of the issuance of such violation shall be sent simultaneously by regular mail to the occupant at the dwelling unit that is the subject of such notice of violation.  The department may postpone the date by which a violation shall be corrected upon a showing, made within the time set for correction in the notice, that prompt action to correct the violation has been taken but that full correction cannot be completed within the time provided because of serious technical difficulties, inability to obtain necessary materials, funds or labor, inability to gain access to the dwelling unit wherein the violation exists, or such other portion of the building as may be necessary to make the required repair.  Such postponement shall not exceed fourteen days from the date of correction set forth in the notice of violation.  The department may require such other conditions as are deemed necessary to insure correction of the violations within the time set for the postponement.  The department may grant one additional postponement of no more than fourteen days for the reasons authorized by this section so long as the paint or other condition which is the subject of the violation has been stabilized. The department is also authorized to promulgate rules establishing criteria for a postponement of the time to correct for a longer period of time where such postponement is requested because of one or more substantial capital improvements will be made that will, when completed, significantly reduce the presence of lead-based paint in such multiple dwelling or dwelling unit including, but not limited to, a requirement that the paint which is the subject of the violation is stabilized. The department shall provide to the owner and the occupant a written statement signed and dated by the person making such decision setting forth the reasons for each postponement of the date by which a violation shall be corrected or the reason for the denial of such application for a postponement.  Said written statement shall be part of the records of the department. \\par\n\\cf0 (2)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the notice of violation shall direct that the correction of each violation cited therein shall be certified to the department.  Such certification shall be made in writing, under oath by the registered owner, a registered officer or director of a corporate owner or by the registered managing agent.  Such certification shall include a statement that the violation was corrected in compliance with paragraph one of subdivision a of section 27-2056.11 of this code and shall include a copy of the lead-contaminated dust clearance test results.  All certifications shall be delivered to the department and acknowledgment of receipt therefor obtained or shall be mailed to the department by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, no later than five days after the date set for correction, and shall include the date when each violation was corrected.  Such certification of correction shall be supported by a sworn statement by the person who performed the work if performed by an employee or agent of the owner.  A copy of such certification shall be mailed to the complainant by the department not more than twelve full calendar days from the date of receipt of such certification by the department.  Failure to file such certification shall establish a prima facie case that such violation has not been corrected.\\cf1  \\par\n(3)  Whenever the department shall issue a notice of violation to correct a condition that constitutes a violation of section 27-2056.6 of article fourteen of subchapter two of this chapter, the department shall within fourteen days after the date set for the correction of such violation conduct a final inspection to verify that the violation has been corrected.  Where, upon conducting an inspection, the department determines that a violation has not been corrected, the department shall correct such violation within forty-five additional days of such inspection or in such shorter time as is practicable.\\par\n(4)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the department shall not remove a violation from its records nor shall it be deemed that such violation has been corrected unless the records of the department contain written verification that the department has conducted a final inspection of the premises and that such inspection verifies that the violation has been corrected, and copies of lead-contaminated dust clearance test results whenever such tests are required by applicable law, rule or regulation.  A copy of the report of the final inspection of a dwelling unit and the status of the violation shall be mailed or delivered to the occupant and the owner.\\par\n (5)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a person making a false certification of correction  of a violation issued pursuant to article 14 of subchapter 2 of this chapter, in addition to any other civil penalty, shall be subject to a civil penalty of  not less than one thousand dollars nor more than three thousand dollars for each false certification made, recoverable by the department in a civil action brought in a court of competent jurisdiction.\\cf0  If the person making such false certification is an employee of the owner then such owner shall be responsible for such civil penalty.  In addition, any such person making a false certification of correction shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to one thousand dollars or imprisonment for up to one year or both.\\cf1\\par\n(6)  \\cf0 Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a person who violates article fourteen of subchapter two of this chapter by failing to correct such violation in accordance with paragraph one of subdivision a of section 27-2056.11 of this code shall be subject to a civil penalty of  two hundred fifty dollars per day for each violation to a maximum of ten thousand dollars from the initial date set for correction in the notice of violation until the date the violation is corrected and certified to the department, and in addition to any civil penalty shall, whenever appropriate, be punished under the provisions of article three of subchapter five of this code.  There shall be a presumption that the condition constituting a violation continues after the service of the notice of violation.  The owner shall be responsible for the correction of all violations noticed pursuant to article fourteen of subchapter two of this chapter, but in an action for civil penalties pursuant to this subdivision may in defense or mitigation of such owner's liability for civil penalties show\\cf1 :\\par\n(i) That the condition which constitutes the violation did not exist at the time the violation was placed; or\\par\n(ii)  That he or she began to correct the condition which constitutes the violation promptly upon discovering it but that full correction could not be completed expeditiously because of serious technical difficulties, inability to obtain necessary materials, funds or labor, or inability to gain access to the dwelling unit wherein the violation exists, or such other portion of the building as might be necessary to make the repair, provided that a postponement was granted pursuant to this subdivision; or\\par\n(iii)  That he or she was unable to obtain a permit or license necessary to correct the violation, provided that diligent and prompt application was made therefor; or\\par\n(iv)  That the violation giving rise to the action was caused by the act of negligence, neglect or abuse of another not in the employ or subject to the direction of the owner, except that the owner shall be precluded from showing in defense or mitigation of such owner's liability for civil penalties evidence of any acts occurring, undertaken, or performed by any predecessor in title prior to the owner taking control of the premises.  Where the aforesaid allegations are made by way of mitigation of penalties, the owner shall show, by competent proof, pertinent financial data and efforts made to obtain necessary materials, funds or labor or to gain access, or to obtain a permit or license and such other evidence as the court may require.\\par\nIf the court finds that sufficient mitigating circumstances exist, it may remit all or part of any penalties arising from the violations, but may condition such remission upon a correction of the violation within a time period fixed by the court.\\par\n\\cf0  (7)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, failure by the department to comply with any time period provided in this section relating to responsibilities of the department shall not render null and void any notice of violation issued by the department or the department of health and mental hygiene pursuant to such article or section, and shall not provide a basis for defense or mitigation of an owner\\rquote s liability for civil penalties for violation of such article\\par\n\\cf1\\ulnone\\'a77.
