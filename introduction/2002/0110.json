  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n        Section 1.  Declaration of Legislative Findings and Intent.  The Council enacts this legislation to maximize the efficiency of the City's Emergency Medical Service and to promote uniformity in the treatment of all patients.  \n   \tFor many years, the City has supplemented its Emergency Medical Service with general ambulance service provided by voluntary hospitals.  This practice has continued since the Emergency Medical Service has been transferred to the New York City Fire Department.  When a voluntary hospital reaches an agreement with the Fire Department to provide ambulance service in the City's 911 system, it agrees to follow the same operating rules and procedures that govern the City's Emergency Medical Service workers.  However, the Council is concerned over whether the Fire Department has sufficient authority to ensure that voluntary hospitals that participate in the 911 system adhere to departmental protocols.  \n         In the interest of public health and safety, the Council finds that, in order to ensure that patients are transported as quickly and efficiently as possible to the appropriate medical center, the Fire Department must be provided with greater enforcement authority over the entities that participate in the 911 system.  Therefore, this legislation authorizes the Fire Department to subject those institutions that fail to follow the Department's operating procedures to a civil penalty.  In addition to granting the Department greater authority over the institutions that participate in the 911 system, this legislation provides an incentive for these institutions to adhere to the Department's guidelines, thereby promoting uniformity of treatment for all patients.   \n   � 2.   Chapter 19 of the New York City charter is hereby amended by adding a new section 495 to read as follows:\n   � 495.  General ambulance and emergency medical service; enforcement. Any hospital, or other entity, providing ambulance or emergency medical service in the City pursuant to an agreement with the department, that violates any rule or protocol issued by the department in relation to the provision of ambulance service or emergency medical service, shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000 as determined by the commissioner.\n   � 3. This local law shall take effect immediately.\n   \n   \n04/04/2002\nLS # 272",
