  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      Section 1.  Declaration of legislative intent.  The Council finds that provisions of the City's current Building Code are seriously deficient and should be aligned with the current needs of the City and standards of the building industry. The City should adopt a model building code to facilitate the construction of buildings and structures in the City, to enhance the safety of buildings and building construction, to simplify the City's Building Code, to allow for new technologies and to reduce the cost of construction in the City.  A model building code will facilitate both new construction efforts and the rehabilitation of existing buildings and will improve the health, safety and welfare of the City's residents and visitors. The Council hereby finds that the 2000 International Building Code(r), which incorporates into one integrated code the best elements of three different model building codes, should be adopted by the City of New York. The Council hereby declares that it is imperative to establish a Building Code Commission whose principal task shall be to examine the 2000 International Building Code(r) and identify any provisions of such code that should be revised to reflect conditions specific to the City of New York and develop and propose amendments for its adoption and use by the City.\n\t�2.  Building Code Commission.\ta.  There is hereby established a Building Code Commission which shall examine and analyze the latest published version of the 2000 International Building Code(r) developed by the International Code Council. The Commission shall be authorized to make recommendations to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council with regards to the City's Building Code. \n      b. The Commission shall consist of eighteen members and shall be co-chaired by the Commissioner of Buildings and the Speaker of the Council, each of whom shall serve as ex-officio members, or a designee.  The remaining members of the Commission shall consist of eight members appointed by the Mayor, which shall include the Fire Commissioner, who shall also serve as an ex-officio member, or a designee, and eight members appointed by the Speaker of the Council, which shall include a member of the public.  The Mayor and the Speaker of the Council shall each appoint one registered architect, one professional engineer, one representative of the commercial real estate industry, one representative of the for-profit residential real estate industry, one representative of the not-for-profit residential real estate industry, one representative of a construction-related labor union and one representative of the construction industry.  The members of the Commission shall be appointed within forty-five days of the effective date of this section, shall serve without compensation and shall continue in service until their successors have been appointed.\n\tc.  The co-chairs of the Commission may jointly appoint an executive director to serve at their pleasure and may employ or retain such other employees and consultants as are necessary to fulfill its functions within appropriations for such purposes.\n\td.  Within thirty days after the appointment of the last member of the Commission, the Commission shall establish a committee from amongst its members, which shall examine the International Building Code to identify any revisions that should be made to it to reflect conditions specific to the City of New York.  The Commission shall be authorized to establish such other committees and working groups from amongst its members and from amongst members of the public at large, as is necessary.  At least one such working group shall be created to study and propose building code requirements that are specific to the rehabilitation of existing buildings.\n\te.  On or before September 1, 2006, the Commission shall submit to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council a report containing recommendations for revisions to the 2000 International Building Code(r) or, if no such revisions are required, the reasons therefore.  \n      �3. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision e of section two of this local law, on January 1, 2007, the provisions of the 2000 International Building Code(r) shall take effect within the city of New York, but for the administrative provisions set forth in chapter one of the 2000 International Building Code(r), and all provisions of the New York city building code in effect as of December 31, 2006 that are inconsistent with the remaining provisions of the 2000 International Building Code(r) shall be deemed to be REPEALED.  \n      �4.
