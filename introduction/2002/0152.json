The agency shall also establish maximum costs for the factors under paragraph (3) of this subdivision which determine maximum gross building rental to preclude increases which would otherwise result from excessive expenditures in the operation and maintenance of the building.\n    \tThe return allowed on capital may be revised from time to time by local law.\n    \t�2. Paragraph (5) of subdivision a of section 26-405 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law 20 for the year 1980 is amended to read as follows:\n    \t(5) Where a maximum rent established pursuant to this title on or after January first, nineteen hundred seventy-two, is higher than the previously existing maximum rent, the landlord may not collect more than seven and one-half per centum increase from a tenant in occupancy on such date in any one year period, provided however, that where the period for which the rent is established exceeds one year, regardless of how the collection thereof is averaged over such period, the rent the landlord shall be entitled to receive during the first twelve months shall not be increased by more than seven and one-half percentum of the rent paid during the previous year. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing limitations in this paragraph (5), maximum rent shall be increased if ordered by the agency pursuant to subparagraphs (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (k), (l), (m) or (n) or paragraph (1) of subdivision go of this section.

Subparagraph (n) of paragraph (1) of subdivision g of Section 26-405 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law 20 for the year 1980 is hereby REPEALED.\n    \t�4. Paragraph (l) of subdivision (n) of Section 26-405 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as last amended by local law 20 for the year 1980, is hereby amended to read as follows:\n    \t(1) No increase in maximum rent pursuant to paragraph (2) or paragraphs (3), (4), or (5) of subdivision a of this section, or subparagraphs (a), (b), (c), [(l) or (n)] of paragraph (1) of subdivision g of this section, shall be collectible from a tenant to whom there has been issued a currently valid rent exemption order pursuant to this subdivision, except as provided in such order.\n    \t�5.
