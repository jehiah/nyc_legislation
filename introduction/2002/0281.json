  "Summary": "",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection 1. Legislative history and intent. In 2002, 2,013 rapes were reported to the New York City Police Department. Public health and public safety advocates alike acknowledge that the number of rapes reported to authorities constitute only a fraction of the number of rapes that actually occur. Alarmingly, between one and five percent of all rapes end in pregnancy (Holmes, et al., Rape-related Pregnancy: Estimates and Descriptive Characteristics from a National Sample of Women, American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, 175:2, 1996). Over half of these pregnancies will end in abortion.\n\tEmergency contraception (EC) is a safe and effective way to prevent unintended pregnancy. Approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 1997, EC works to prevent pregnancy by delaying ovulation or preventing fertilization. If taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse, EC reduces the risk of unintended pregnancy by as much as 89 percent. EC is frequently and erroneously confused with mifepristone and methotrexate, drugs used in medical abortion. EC differs from these drugs by working to prevent pregnancy from occurring instead of terminating an established pregnancy. The provision of EC to rape victims is considered to be the accepted standard of care for treatment of rape victims by the New York State Department of Health, as well as health professional organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Medical Association and the American College of Emergency Physicians. \n\tSurveys on the provision of EC in emergency departments in New York City hospitals reveal that approximately half of New York City emergency departments do not provide rape victims with EC. Significantly, these surveys also reveal that emergency departments operated by the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation do in fact provide EC.\n\tThe Council finds that the provision of EC to a rape victim when medically appropriate aids to reduce the trauma already inflicted on the victim by preventing an unwanted pregnancy from resulting from that rape. The City Council further finds that the prevention of unintended pregnancies resulting from rape avoids costs associated with unwanted pregnancy, including medical care and foster care, some of which are ultimately borne by the City. Therefore, the Council declares that New York City should contract only with hospitals which provide rape victims with the accepted standard of care for treatment of such patients, including the administration of emergency contraception.\n\tSection 2. The administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 6-125 to read as follows:\n\t�6-125. a. For the purposes of this section only, the following terms shall have the following meanings:\n\t(1) \"City agency\" means a city, county, borough, administration, department, division bureau, board or commission, or a corporation, institution or agency of government the expenses of which are paid in whole or in part from the city treasury, but shall not include the health and hospitals corporation.\n\t(2) \"Covered agreement\" means any agreement, including but not limited to, memoranda of understanding, and excluding contracts, entered into on or after the effective date of the local law that added this section, between a hospital and a city agency.\n\t(3) \"Covered contract\" means any contract entered into on or after the effective date of the local law that added this section, between a hospital and a city agency.\n\t(4)  \"Emergency contraception\" shall mean one or more prescription drugs, used separately or in combination, to be administered to or self-administered by a patient in a dosage and manner intended to prevent pregnancy when used within a medically recommended amount of time following sexual intercourse and dispensed for that purpose in accordance with professional standards of practice, and which has been found safe and effective for such use by the United States food and drug administration.\n\t(5)  \"Hospital\" means any facility operating pursuant to article 28 of the public health law which provides emergency medical care.\n\t(6) \"Rape victim\" means any female person who alleges or is alleged to have been raped and presents to a hospital.\n\tb. No city agency shall enter into a covered agreement or covered contract with any hospital that does not contain a provision whereby such hospital agrees to inform rape victims presenting to its emergency department of the availability of emergency contraception and, if requested, to administer, if medically appropriate, such contraception in a timely manner.\n\tc.

Legislative history and intent. In 2002, 2,013 rapes were reported to the New York City Police Department. Public health and public safety advocates alike acknowledge that the number of rapes reported to authorities constitute only a fraction of the number of rapes that actually occur. Alarmingly, between one and five percent of all rapes end in pregnancy (Holmes, et al., Rape-related Pregnancy: Estimates and Descriptive Characteristics from a National Sample of Women, American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, 175:2, 1996). Over half of these pregnancies will end in abortion.\\par\n\\tab Emergency contraception (EC) is a safe and effective way to prevent unintended pregnancy. Approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 1997, EC works to prevent pregnancy by delaying ovulation or preventing fertilization. If taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse, EC reduces the risk of unintended pregnancy by as much as 89 percent. EC is frequently and erroneously confused with mifepristone and methotrexate, drugs used in medical abortion. EC differs from these drugs by working to prevent pregnancy from occurring instead of terminating an established pregnancy. The provision of EC to rape victims is considered to be the accepted standard of care for treatment of rape victims by the New York State Department of Health, as well as health professional organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Medical Association and the American College of Emergency Physicians. \\par\n\\tab Surveys on the provision of EC in emergency departments in New York City hospitals reveal that approximately half of New York City emergency departments do not provide rape victims with EC. Significantly, these surveys also reveal that emergency departments operated by the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation do in fact provide EC.\\par\n\\tab The Council finds that the provision of EC to a rape victim when medically appropriate aids to reduce the trauma already inflicted on the victim by preventing an unwanted pregnancy from resulting from that rape. The City Council further finds that the prevention of unintended pregnancies resulting from rape avoids costs associated with unwanted pregnancy, including medical care and foster care, some of which are ultimately borne by the City. Therefore, the Council declares that New York City should contract only with hospitals which provide rape victims with the accepted standard of care for treatment of such patients, including the administration of emergency contraception.\\par\n\\tab Section 2. The administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 6-125 to read as follows:\\par\n\\tab\\'a76-125. a.
