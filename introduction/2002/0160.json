  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      Section 1.\tDeclaration of legislative findings and intent.  The Council finds and declares that the vending of written matter should be free of unnecessary restrictions as long as such activity is not a threat to the public health, safety or welfare.  The Council also finds that geographical areas under the jurisdiction of the department of parks and recreation are integral in preserving the welfare of the public.  As such, the commissioner of parks and recreation has the responsibility of balancing the interest of the public to enjoy the resources of parks with the rights of the vendors of written matter.  Permitting unbridled and unregulated vending of written matter in parks seriously undermines the ability of the commissioner of parks and recreation to provide public recreational activity and to preserve the character of parks for the benefit of the public.  Moreover, parks and parks facilities should not be overrun with commercial activity.  The Council further finds that there is a specific need for reasonable measures to regulate the time, place and manner for the vending of written materials in parks consistent with the First Amendment.  Accordingly, the commissioner of parks and recreation shall be authorized to regulate, through a permitting system, the vending of written matter in areas under the commissioner's jurisdiction.\n\t�2.\tSection 20-473 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 14 for the year 1995, is amended to read as follows:\n\tSection 20-473.
