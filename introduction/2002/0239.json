  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection 1. Declaration of Legislative Findings and Intent.  The effects of September 11 and the deepening recession have been devastating for low income New Yorkers.  The volatility of the real estate industry coupled with new trends in the service economy are undermining stable employment relationships and creating a drain on an already over-burdened social service system.  At a time of great uncertainty, it is the policy of the City to promote stability in employment for building service workers, which will reduce the need for social services resulting from unemployment, and promote stability in the service industry. \n\t�2. Chapter 5 of Title 22 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York is hereby amended by adding a new section 22-505, to read as follows:\n\t�22-505 Displaced Building Service Workers  a. For purposes of this section only, the following terms shall have the following meaning:\n\t(1) \"Building service\" means work performed in connection with the care or maintenance of an existing building and includes, but is not limited to, work performed by a watchman, guard, doorman, building cleaner, porter, handyman, janitor, gardener, groundskeeper, stationary fireman, elevator operator and starter, window cleaner, and superintendents.\n\t(2) \"Building service contract\" means a contract let to any covered employer for the furnishing of building services, and includes any subcontracts for such services.\n\t(3) \"Building service contractor\" means any person who enters into a building service contract.\n\t(4) \"Building service employee\" means any person employed as a building service employee by a covered employer who has been regularly assigned to a building on a full or part-time basis for at least ninety days immediately preceding any transition in employment subject to this section except for (i) persons who are managerial, supervisory, or confidential employees, provided that this exemption shall not apply to building superintendents or resident managers, (ii) persons earning in excess of twenty-five dollars per hour from a covered employer, and (iii) persons regularly scheduled to work fewer than eight hours per week at a building.\n\t(5) \"City of New York\" means any city, county or borough, administration, department, division, bureau, board or commission, or a corporation, institution or agency of government the expenses of which are paid in whole or in part from the city treasury. \n\t(6) \"Covered employer\" means any person who owns or manages real property,  either on its own behalf or for another person, within the City of New York, including, but not limited to, housing cooperatives, condominium associations, building managing agents, and any building service contractor, provided, however, that the requirements of this subchapter shall not apply to (i) residential buildings of less than 50 units, (ii) commercial office, institutional or retail buildings of less than 100,000 square feet, (iii) any building in which the city of New York and/or any governmental entity, the head or majority of members of which are appointed by one or more officers of the city of New York, occupies fifty percent or more of the rentable square footage, or (iv) to the extent that such requirements conflict with title 11, section 162 of the state finance law.\n\t(7) \"Person\" means any individual, proprietorship, partnership, joint venture, corporation, limited liability company, trust, association, or other entity that may employ persons or enter into service contracts, but shall not include the city of New York, the state of New York, and the federal government or any other governmental entity, or any individual or entity managing real property for a governmental entity.\n\t(8) \"Successor employer\" means a covered employer that (i) has been awarded a building service contract to provide, in whole or in part, building services that are substantially similar to those provided under a service contract that has recently been terminated, or (ii) has purchased or acquired control of a property in which building service employees were employed. \n\tb.
