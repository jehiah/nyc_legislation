Cause of Action Against Manufacturers of Assault Weapons\n\n      a. For the purposes of this section: (1) \"assault weapon\" shall mean an \"assault weapon\" as defined in section 10-301;\n\n      (2) \"dealer\" shall mean a \"dealer in firearms\" and a \"dealer in rifles and shotguns\", as such terms are defined in section 10-301;\n\n      (3) \"importer\" shall mean any person engaged in the business of importing or bringing weapons into the United States for sale or distribution;\n\n      (4) \"manufacturer\" shall mean any person in business to manufacture or assemble a weapon for sale or distribution. \n\n      b.

(1) No action may be commenced pursuant to this section by any person who is injured or killed by the discharge of an assault weapon while such person is committing or attempting to commit a crime (whether or not such crime is actually charged), or while such person is attempting to evade arrest by a law enforcement official.  This exemption shall be in the nature of an affirmative defense, and shall be proven by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\n      (2) No action may be commenced pursuant to this section by any person injured or killed by the discharge of an assault weapon by a law enforcement official.\n      \n      (3) This section shall not limit in scope any cause of action, other than that provided by this section, available to a person injured by or killed by an assault weapon.\n      \n      (4) Nothing in this section shall prevent a manufacturer, importer or dealer from seeking whole or partial indemnity or contribution for any liability incurred under this section from any third party wholly or partially responsible for the injury or death.\n      \n\t� 2.
