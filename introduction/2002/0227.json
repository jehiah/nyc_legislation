Section 17-801 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law 26 of the year 2000,  is amended to read as follows: \n\tLegislative findings. The City Council hereby finds that New York City is experiencing a serious overpopulation of unwanted dogs  and cats.  This  is a matter of serious concern affecting the public health, safety and welfare. The  Center  for  Animal  Care  and  Control,  which operates  animal  shelters  under contract with the City's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, estimates that 67,000 unwanted, stray or abandoned dogs and cats entered its facilities in 1998. Of these animals, approximately  seventy percent were not spayed or neutered. While wandering the City's streets, homeless  dogs  and  cats  reproduce  at  alarming rates, exacerbating a potentially unhealthy and dangerous  situation.  As  a  result  of  this situation,  dog  packs  have formed in some areas, increasing numbers of individuals and animals are  at  risk  for  rabies,  and  many  homeless animals  have  become  the victims of vehicular accidents. These animals also suffer from lack of food and water and exposure  to  the  elements. Given  the  large  and  growing  number  of  unwanted dogs and cats, the Council finds that a law providing for a full-service animal shelter  in each  borough  and  the  spaying  and  neutering of animals adopted from animal shelters or purchased from pet shops is necessary to protect  the health,  safety and welfare of New York City residents. The Council also  finds that with the advancement of medical knowledge over the  past  ten years,  many veterinarians now advocate and practice early sterilization of pets, as early  as  eight  weeks  of  age.  Veterinarians  at  animal hospitals  and  humane  shelters  across  the  country,  as  well as the American  Society  for  the  Prevention  of  Cruelty  to  Animals,  have performed  thousands  of  early  spay-neuter  surgeries. Many veterinary associations now also agree that even though any  surgery  has  inherent risks, kittens and puppies heal faster and are lower surgical risks than older  animals who may be ill, in heat, or pregnant. If dogs or cats are spayed or neutered before adoption from a shelter or purchase from a pet shop, then the chance that they will add more unwanted offspring to  the numbers that already exist will be eliminated.\n\t�  36.

Section 17-801 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law 26 of the year 2000,  is amended to read as follows: \\par\n\\tab Legislative findings. The City Council hereby finds that New York City is experiencing a serious overpopulation of unwanted dogs  and cats.  This  is a matter of serious concern affecting the public health, safety and welfare. The  Center  for  Animal  Care  and  Control,  which operates  animal  shelters  under contract with the City's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, estimates that 67,000 unwanted, stray or abandoned dogs and cats entered its facilities in 1998. Of these animals, approximately  seventy percent were not spayed or neutered. While wandering the City's streets, homeless  dogs  and  cats  reproduce  at  alarming rates, exacerbating a potentially unhealthy and dangerous  situation.  As  a  result  of  this situation,  dog  packs  have formed in some areas, increasing numbers of individuals and animals are  at  risk  for  rabies,  and  many  homeless animals  have  become  the victims of vehicular accidents. These animals also suffer from lack of food and water and exposure  to  the  elements. Given  the  large  and  growing  number  of  unwanted dogs and cats, the Council finds that a law providing for a full-service animal shelter  in each  borough  and  the  spaying  and  neutering of animals adopted from animal shelters or purchased from pet shops is necessary to protect  the health,  safety and welfare of New York City residents. The Council also  finds that with the advancement of medical knowledge over the  past  ten years,  many veterinarians now advocate and practice early sterilization of pets, as early  as  eight  weeks  of  age.  Veterinarians  at  animal hospitals  and  humane  shelters  across  the  country,  as  well as the American  Society  for  the  Prevention  of  Cruelty  to  Animals,  have performed  thousands  of  early  spay-neuter  surgeries. Many veterinary associations now also agree that even though any  surgery  has  inherent risks, kittens and puppies heal faster and are lower surgical risks than older  animals who may be ill, in heat, or pregnant. If dogs or cats are spayed or neutered before adoption from a shelter or purchase from a pet shop, then the chance that they will add more unwanted offspring to  the numbers that already exist will be eliminated.\\par\n\\tab\\'a7  36.
