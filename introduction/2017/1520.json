For purposes of this section, the term \"gender\" includes actual or perceived sex and shall also include a person's gender identity, self-image, appearance, behavior, or expression, whether or not that gender identity, self-image, appearance, behavior or expression is different from that traditionally associated with the legal sex assigned to that person at birth. The mayor shall submit an annual report to the council, borough presidents, and community boards analyzing the social, economic and environmental health of the city, including any disparities among populations including gender, racial groups, income groups and, sexual orientation, where relevant data is available, and proposing strategies for addressing the issues raised in such analysis. The report shall present and analyze data on the social, economic and environmental conditions, and gender, racial, and income disparities, and, disparities relating to sexual orientation, as available, as well as other disparities as may be identified by the mayor within such conditions, which may include, national origin, citizenship status, age, and disability status, where relevant data is available, which are significantly related to the jurisdiction of the agencies responsible for the services specified in section twenty seven hundred four, the health and hospitals corporation, and such other agencies as the mayor shall from time to time specify. The report shall include the generally accepted indices of [unemployment] economic security and mobility, poverty, education, child welfare, housing affordability and quality, homelessness, health, physical environment, transportation, [crime] criminal justice and policing, civic participation, public employment and such other indices as the mayor shall require by executive order or the council shall require by local law, including where possible generally accepted data or indices regarding gender, racial, and income-based disparities and disparities relating to sexual orientation, as available, within each indexed category of information, in addition to disparities based upon other population characteristics that may be identified by the mayor. Such report shall be submitted no later than sixty days before the community boards are required to submit budget priorities pursuant to section two hundred thirty and shall contain: (1) the reasonably available statistical data, for the current and previous five years, on such conditions in the city and, where possible, in its subdivisions disaggregated by gender, racial group, and income group, and sexual orientation to the extent that such data is available; and a comparison of this data with such relevant national, regional or other standards or averages as the mayor deems appropriate; (2) a narrative discussion of the differences and the disparities in such conditions by gender, racial group  and income group, and sexual orientation, as available, and among the subdivisions of the city and of the changes over time in such conditions; and (3) the mayor's short and long term plans, organized by agency or by issue, for responding to the significant problems and disparities evidenced by the data presented in the report.\n      �2.
