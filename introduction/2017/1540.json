  "Summary": "This bill would require secondhand automobile dealers to conspicuously post and provide consumers with a bill of rights. The bill of rights would inform consumers of their right: i) to a two-day automobile contract cancellation option agreement; ii) to seek financing from lenders other than the dealer; iii) to purchase the automobile at the advertised price; iv) to seek the dealer’s complaint history or to make a complaint by calling 311; v) to receive a Used Car Buyer Guide and to additional rights under New York State’s Used Car Lemon Law; vi) to receive certain disclosures when signing a financing agreement; vii) to not be required to purchase add-ons; and viii) to receive an itemized list of the cost of any requested add-ons. For each executed contract, the secondhand automobile dealer must obtain from the consumer an initialed or signed copy of the consumer bill of rights and retain it for six years. The dealer must also provide the consumer bill of rights in the language used to negotiate the contract.",
