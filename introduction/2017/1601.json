  "Summary": "The proposed bill would require the Commissioner of the Administration for Children’s Services (ACS) to coordinate meetings, referred to as ChildStat, to improve ACS’ functioning with respect to child welfare practices. The meetings would be held at least once a week, and shall consist of a comprehensive review of the practices of one zone.  ACS divides its child welfare division into 13 separate zones across the City based on geographic area. The bill would require the commissioner, and other senior staff to attend the meetings. At the meetings, data trends comparing the zone to all of ACS would be reviewed. There would also be an in-depth review of a randomly selected case. ACS would be required to produce semiannual reports on the results of the ChildStat meetings.",
