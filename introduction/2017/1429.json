Chapter 33 of the New York city building code is amended to add a new section 3301.12, to read as follows:\n3301.12 Pre-shift safety meetings. Each permit holder at a site that requires a site safety manager, site safety coordinator, or construction superintendent shall ensure that each construction or demolition worker employed or otherwise engaged at such site by the permit holder or performing subcontracted work for or on behalf of such permit holder takes part in a safety meeting at the beginning of such worker's shift, but before such worker commences any construction or demolition work in such shift, in accordance with the requirements of Sections 3301.12.1 through 3301.12.3.\n\nException: Where other sections of this code or rules promulgated thereunder specify pre-task or pre-shift meetings for specific types of work, those requirements shall instead apply.\n\n3301.12.1 Pre-shift safety meeting to be conducted by a competent person. Pre-shift safety meetings shall be conducted at the beginning of each worker's shift, but before such worker commences any construction or demolition work in such shift, by a competent person designated by the permit holder, or where so authorized by the permit holder, by a competent person designated by the subcontractor. Such competent person shall have the ability to communicate with each worker who takes part in such meeting.\n\n3301.12.2 Pre-shift safety meeting content. The pre-shift safety meeting shall include a review of activities and tasks to be performed during the shift, including specific safety concerns or risks associated with fulfilling such work.\n\n3301.12.3 Records. The permit holder shall maintain, for each worker, a record of one pre-shift safety meeting per week. Such record shall include for each such meeting:\n\n1.   The date and time of each such meeting; \n\n2.   The name, title and company affiliation of each worker who participated; and\n\n3.  The name, title and company affiliation of the competent person who conducted such meeting, along with such person's signature.\n\n\tï¿½ 2.
