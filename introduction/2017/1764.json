(i) For final assessment rolls to be completed prior to two thousand seventeen, the assessed value limitation shall be thirty thousand dollars. \n      (ii) For the final assessment roll to be completed in two thousand seventeen, the assessed value limitation shall be thirty-two thousand dollars increased by the cost-of-living adjustment percentage of two thousand seventeen. For the purposes of this computation, the cost-of-living adjustment percentage of two thousand seventeen shall be equal to the \"applicable increase percentage\" used by the United States commissioner of social security to determine the monthly social security benefits payable in two thousand seventeen to individuals, as provided by subsection (i) of section four hundred fifteen of title forty-two of the United States code. \n      (iii) For final assessment rolls to be completed in each ensuing year, the applicable assessed value limitation, cost-of-living adjustment percentage and applicable increase percentage shall all be advanced by one year, and the assessed valuation limitation shall be the previously applicable assessed value limitation increased by the new cost-of-living adjustment percentage. If there should be a year for which there is no applicable increase percentage due to a general benefit increase as defined by subdivision three of subsection (i) of section four hundred fifteen of title forty-two of the United States code, the applicable increase percentage for purposes of this computation shall be deemed to be the percentage which would have yielded that general benefit increase. \n      (iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the assessed value limitation shall not at any time exceed thirty-five thousand dollars.\n� 2.
