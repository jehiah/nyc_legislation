  "Summary": "This bill would extend the time agencies have to complete their open data compliance plan and publish data on the open data portal; it would codify agency’s existing practice of designating an employee to be the agency’s open data coordinator; it requires the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications to collect, analyze, and publish site analytics of the open data portal; and it requires the creation of a master list to track all public data sets scheduled for publication.",
