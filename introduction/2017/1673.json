  "Summary": "This local law would codify the Department of Finance (DOF)’s Automated City Register Information System (ACRIS) Notice of Recorded Document Program, by requiring DOF to establish and maintain a system that would allow individuals to register to receive notifications by email, text message or postal mail whenever certain deed-related or mortgage-related documents affecting an ownership interest in real property are recorded with the City Register or the Office of the Richmond County Clerk (where DOF has received notice from the Clerk). DOF would be required to automatically enroll the named property owner into the system upon recording of such documents (with the ability to opt-out). DOF would also be required to report on utilization of the system and referrals to the Sheriff regarding suspected deed fraud, as well as to engage in outreach to property owners about the system.",
