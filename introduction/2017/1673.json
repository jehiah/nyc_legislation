DOF would be required to automatically enroll the named property owner into the system upon recording of such documents (with the ability to opt-out). DOF would also be required to report on utilization of the system and referrals to the Sheriff regarding suspected deed fraud, as well as to engage in outreach to property owners about the system.","TextID":60578,"Text":"Int.
