  "Summary": "Proposed Int. No. 1443-A would require training for certain staff working in Department of Homeless Services (DHS) shelters and Human Resources Administration (HRA) HIV/AIDS Services Administration (HASA) facilities in administering naloxone (Narcan) to individuals who have overdosed on opioids. The bill would also require those facilities to have at least one trained staff on duty at all times. Proposed Int. 1443-A would require the agencies to develop and implement a plan to offer training to residents of HASA facilities and DHS shelters who may encounter persons experiencing or who are at a high risk of experiencing an opioid overdose.
