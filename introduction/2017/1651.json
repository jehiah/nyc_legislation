No. 1651-A would require the Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) to provide an annual report on electricity and fossil fuel use in certain City-owned buildings, including identifying whether such buildings have been fitted with equipment for monitoring energy usage in near real-time. This bill would also require DCAS, in conjunction with other appropriate city agencies, to coordinate the installation of energy usage equipment and any necessary software in all city buildings that DCAS identifies as appropriate to receive such installation.",
