These businesses profit by charging vulnerable individuals exorbitant monthly fees for acting as middlemen in accessing services that are otherwise free from the federal government (with a phone call). The federal Department of Education has identified this practice as a “scam” and has warned holders of federal student loans about these businesses. This law also bans advertisements on behalf of such businesses and also includes a civil cause of action for individuals who fall victim to such businesses. These businesses typically advertise with signage in store front windows with a phone number to call.","TextID":58851,"Text":"Int.
