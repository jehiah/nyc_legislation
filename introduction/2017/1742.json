  "Summary": "This bill would extend, indefinitely, the provisions of local law number 64 for the year 2015 that require the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings to issue a monthly report analyzing the civil violations dismissed in its tribunals, including the reasons for dismissal for each violation. LL 64 originally required these monthly reports to be issued only until December 2018 and this bill would make the requirement permanent. The monthly report is to be sent to, among others, the agencies whose violations were dismissed. This bill would also make it a permanent requirement that these same agencies work with the Mayor’s Office of Operations to prepare a biennial report documenting each agency’s planned steps to minimize the issuance of violations that are ultimately dismissed.",
