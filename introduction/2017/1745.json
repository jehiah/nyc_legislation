Such report shall be filed in a form and manner established by the department and shall include such information as the department shall require to measure the progress of such building toward the applicable fossil fuel use and energy use limits established pursuant to subdivision b. Where such report indicates that such building exceeds either such applicable limit by more than ten percent, such report shall include an implementation plan detailing a schedule and means of complying with such limit together with such other information as the department may require.\n      f. 1. The owner of a covered building that does not meet the requirements of paragraph 1 of subdivision b shall be subject to a civil penalty for each year until such building meets such requirements. The civil penalty for each such year shall be calculated as follows:  \n      (a) If such owner is in compliance with subdivision c for such building, the civil penalty shall be equal the amount obtained by (i) subtracting the adjusted fossil fuel use of such building as set forth on the most recent annual report for such building filed pursuant to subdivision c from the applicable fossil fuel use limit for such building pursuant to subdivision b and (ii) multiplying the result by three times the fossil fuel dollar equivalent.\n      (b) If such owner is not in compliance with subdivision c for such building, the amount obtained by multiplying such building's gross floor area by ten times the fossil fuel dollar equivalent.\n      2. Such civil penalties may be recovered by the department or the administering agency in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction or the office of administrative trials and hearings, acting pursuant to section 1049-a of the New York city charter.\n      g. The administering agency shall establish and maintain a program for assisting owners of covered buildings in complying with this section.\n\t� 2.
