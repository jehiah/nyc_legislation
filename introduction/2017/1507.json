Such program shall also allow a multiple dwelling owner who receives an eligible violation to have the penalties for such violation waived if they request such an on-site consultation.\n\t� 27-2056.20 Violations discovered as a result of on-site compliance consultations. Where an owner of a multiple dwelling requests an on-site compliance consultation such consultation shall not result in violations being issued.
