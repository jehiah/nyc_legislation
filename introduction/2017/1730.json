  "Summary": "This bill would require the New York City Department of Transportation and Department of Education to provide seatbelt signage on school buses. Where applicable, such signage would highlight the requirement that buses be equipped with a seat belt for each passenger seat. The signage would also provide information regarding the proper usage of such seatbelts and display language stating “buckle up”. Serious injuries could occur if children fail to use seatbelts on school buses because they or their chaperones are unaware of a seatbelt’s existence or proper usage. Seatbelt signage could therefore help protect children’s safety, health and welfare during transport to and from school.",
