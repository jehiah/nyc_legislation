  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation to conduct a feasibility study on the use of cool pavement on City streets—pavement and pavement coatings designed to keep area temperatures cooler than traditional asphalt and thus combat the urban heat island effect. If the Department finds one or more options feasible, it must conduct a pilot project implementing the feasible option or options. Finally, the Department must submit a report to the mayor and Council on the results of the feasibility study and on the results of any pilot project.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Cool pavement feasibility study and pilot. a. Definitions. For purposes of this section, the term \"cool pavement\" means porous, permeable, light-colored or other pavement and pavement coatings designed to reduce pavement temperatures and ambient air temperatures.\n      b. The department of transportation shall study the feasibility of using cool pavement on city streets. As part of such study, the department shall assess the range of options for cool pavement and the technical feasibility, temperature and other environmental impacts and all anticipated costs of such options. The department shall post on its website and submit to the mayor and the council a report on the results of the study no later than one year after this local law takes effect.\n      c. If the department deems one or more options for cool pavement feasible, the department shall undertake a one-year pilot program to implement such option or options in one or more locations.\n      d. If the department undertakes a pilot program pursuant to subdivision c of this section, the department shall post on its website and submit to the mayor and the council a report on the results no later than 180 days after the pilot concludes.\n      � 2.
