  "Summary": "This bill would require all cranes to be equipped with a global positioning system (GPS), or other similar device, which is capable of transmitting the location of the crane to which it is attached to the Department of Buildings (DOB). Where there is no device, DOB must be notified of the date upon which the crane will arrive at the site before work begins, and the date of the departure of the crane from the site upon conclusion of the work.",
