  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation (“DOT”) to conduct an on-site inspection and prepare a report on whether or not a stoop line stand would have an adverse effect on pedestrian safety or would obstruct pedestrian passage before the Department of Consumer Affairs (“DCA”) may issue or renew any stoop line stand license. Under this bill, the DCA Commissioner would be required to forward copies of the DOT report and the stoop line stand application or renewal to the local council member and community board within five days of having received them.",
