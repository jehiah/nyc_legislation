  "Summary": "This bill would require that whenever a capital project is occurring on an athletic field under Parks Department jurisdiction, the agency implementing the project would also have to install a walkway linking the field to a public sidewalk if none had existed before.",
  "TextID": 59975,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\tSection 1. Chapter 1 of title 18 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 18-152 to read as follows:\n      � 18-152 Pedestrian access to park facilities. a. For any capital project, as defined in section 5-101 of the code, that includes the construction or reconstruction of an outdoor athletic facility, where such facility is within a park under the jurisdiction of the department, is located within 500 feet of a public street and is undertaken on or after the effective date of the local law that added this section, the agency responsible for the design of such project shall construct a sidewalk and a pathway to such sidewalk that is adjacent to such public street and is either sufficient for the unloading of persons from vehicles or is connected to such public transportation. Where there is a parking lot adjacent to such outdoor athletic facility, only a pathway between such parking lot and facility need be constructed.\n      b. The commissioner may exempt a capital project from this section if in the commissioner's judgment such exemption is necessary in the public interest. Within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, the commissioner shall report to the council on any exemptions granted pursuant to this subdivision during such year and the basis for such exemptions.\n      � 2.
