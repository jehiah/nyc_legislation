  "Summary": "This bill would require the department of education to report annually on the number of schools with libraries in the school building, whether the library is shared with any co-located schools, the number of certified librarians working in each school, the number of students served by each librarian, the librarian to student ratio in each school, and the duration and frequency that each grade receives library instruction.  The goal is to ensure that all students have access to school libraries and are learning sufficient research skills.",
