  "Summary": "This bill would allow the commissioner of the Department of Small Business Services (SBS) to collect data from other City agencies regarding workers compensation claims and report such data to the workers’ compensation board. It would also require police to collect workers’ compensation data at accident and crime scenes and report such data to SBS. It would further enact the “Injured Workers Protection Act,” which would require all applicants for a license or permit, or renewal of a license or permit, to provide its workers’ compensation data to the agency issuing the license or permit; the agencies collecting such data would then be required to report such data to SBS; and SBS would be required to report such data to the Workers’ compensation board.",
