  "Summary": "Recently enacted amendments to the New York State Runaway and Homeless Youth Act permits shelters for runaway and homeless youth to serve youth ages 21-24, referred to as homeless young adults, if municipalities include the extended age range in the runaway and homeless youth plan submitted to the New York State Office of Children and Family Services. This bill would require the Department of Youth and Community Development (DYCD) to provide runaway and homeless you services, including shelter services, to homeless young adults in the same manner that services are provided to runaway youth and homeless youth.",
