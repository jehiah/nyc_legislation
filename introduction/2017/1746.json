  "Summary": "This local law would require the New York City Department of Finance (DOF) to establish a secure website that permits property owners to view information regarding their applications for property tax exemptions, their property’s tax exemption status, documents submitted by/to DOF and their property tax payment status. The property owner would also be provided the option on the website to receive written or electronic alerts from DOF, including of any changes in their exemption status. Finally, the website would allow property owners to access existing online resources such as those allowing them to apply for an exemption, update their property/individual information, pay their property tax bill, and submit questions to DOF regarding property tax payments and exemptions.",
