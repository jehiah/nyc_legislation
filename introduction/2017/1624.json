  "Summary": "This bill would require noise mitigation plans for certain construction sites to be sent to nearby schools. Additionally, the bill would require the New York City Department of Environmental Protection to create a position responsible for: (1) reviewing noise mitigation plans with schools near construction sites to ensure that such schools are aware of the protections in place to mitigate the impact of noise; and (2) establishing a system to receive and respond to comments, questions and complaints with respect to the impact of construction noise on schools.",
