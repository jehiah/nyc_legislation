  "Summary": "This bill would require a license to sell electronic cigarettes, similar to the license that is currently required to sell cigarettes. It would also cap the number of electronic cigarette retailers at half the current number, by community district, with the reduction in number coming through attrition. Existing sellers would be able to continue to renew their license so long as they meet all applicable licensure requirements.",
