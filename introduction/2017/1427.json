  "Summary": "This bill would add a definition of the words “reside” and “residency” to the City’s Lead Law, in response to a decision of the New York State Court of Appeals from April of 2016. That decision held that a girl with elevated blood lead levels did not “reside” in her grandmother’s apartment, where she spent 50 hours per week, and that the landlord of the grandmother’s apartment therefore had no duty to abate the lead paint there. This bill would define “residency” as spending 15 or more hours in an apartment in a typical week.",

Section 27-2056.2 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law 1 for the year 2004, is amended by adding a new subdivision (16) to read as follows:\n      (16) \"Reside\" or \"residency\" shall mean being present in a dwelling unit for 15 or more hours in a typical week.\n      � 2.
