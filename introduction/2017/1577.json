  "Summary": "The bill would require the Mayor’s Office of Operations (MOO) to complete a study on client information management systems (systems). Client information management system would mean any electronic software used to collect, record, or manage information about social services that individuals may apply for or receive. The study would include an assessment of efforts to update and integrate systems of agencies that provide social services, strategies to help facilitate information sharing among such agencies to improve inter-agency coordination, an examination of how such agencies can use digital tools to best serve clients, and recommendations of how the City can continue to monitor and evaluate existing systems in order to remain current in the use of technology. The bill would require MOO to submit annual report on its findings and recommendations as well as a progress update each year for three years after the release of the report.",
