  "Summary": "Local Law 51 of 1993 established a homeless services advisory board and an interagency coordinating council to combat homelessness. This bill would amend the provisions of the Administrative Code establishing these bodies by adding that the advisory board appointees would include a member of a community based organization or service provider with relevant expertise, and that the DHS commissioner would meet with the advisory board on a quarterly basis. The bill would also add representatives to the coordinating council from NYCHA, DYCD, ACS, DOE, DOHMH, MOCDV and the chair of the Council’s Committee on General Welfare as members. The bill would also require that the interagency coordinating council meet with the homeless services advisory board and produce an annual report.",
