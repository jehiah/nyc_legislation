  "Summary": "This bill would amend the City’s sterilization waiting period and consent law by clarifying that medical procedures that do not have sterilization as their primary purpose, but which instead may sterilize the patient as a byproduct of such procedure, such as some gender reassignment surgeries, are not subject to the provisions of such law.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n      Section 1. Subdivision 1 of section 17-402 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\n      1. \"Sterilization\" shall mean any procedure or operation, the purpose of which is to render an individual permanently incapable of reproducing.
