  "Summary": "Executive Order No. 19 of 2016 mandates that certain developers of economic development projects receiving $1 million or more in financial assistance from the City must require large retail and food service tenants to enter into labor peace agreements with labor organizations seeking to represent their employees working on the premises of such development projects. The labor peace agreement between the retail or food service employer and the labor organization must, at a minimum, require that the labor organization and its members agree to refrain from picketing, works stoppages, boycotts or other economic interference, and that the employer agrees to maintain a neutral posture with respect to efforts by the labor organization to represent their employees. The proposed legislation would expand the labor peace requirement to additional employers at such economic development projects, including other tenants, subtenants and concessionaires, and to City human services contractors.",
