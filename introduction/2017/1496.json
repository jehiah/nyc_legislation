  "Summary": "Although crime in the City is at historic lows, domestic violence persists. Every day, the New York Police Department (NYPD) responds to over 700 domestic incidents. This bill requires the Mayor’s Office to Combat Domestic Violence (OCDV), in conjunction with the NYPD, to submit to the Mayor and Speaker of the Council and post on its website a report detailing information about the City’s new domestic violence initiatives. The report must include data on housing attorneys placed in Family Justice Centers and the results of efforts of such attorneys to assist survivors with legal matters related to housing, such as removing perpetrators from leases, transferring leases from perpetrators to survivors, and terminating leases without penalty. The report must also include data on chronic domestic violence cases and chronic offenders, NYPD outreach efforts to survivors, and NYPD practices to identify and track chronic offenders. OCDV is required to submit reports quarterly and annually.",
