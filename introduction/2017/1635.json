  "Summary": "The proposed bill would require the Department of Social Services to create and issue a job center “appointment receipt” for all individuals who visit job centers. The appointment receipt would include any documents received by the agency from the visitor, the reason for the visit, and a time stamp indicating the time and date a visitor was present at the job center. The bill would require the department to post to its website a monthly report of the average constituent wait times at each job center. The bill would further require the department to display in job centers information on how to make a complaint and would require the department to issue a tracking number to track the status of a complaint.",
