  "Summary": "This bill would require the department of citywide administrative services to conduct a feasibility study on the installation of utility-scale battery storage systems on city buildings (usually buildings that are more than 10,000 gross square feet and that are owned by the city or for which the city regularly directly pays all of the annual energy bills), and to coordinate the installation of such systems on city buildings where it is deemed feasible and cost-effective to do so. Additionally, this bill would require a feasibility study that also identifies the environmental and financial benefits relating to the installation of utility-scale battery storage systems on non-city buildings.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1.  Chapter 2 of title 4 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 4-207.2 to read as follows: \n\t� 4-207.2 Utility-scale battery storage systems for city buildings. a. Definitions. As used in this chapter, the following terms have the following meanings:\n      Battery storage system. The term \"battery storage system\" means a set of methods and technologies utilizing a range of electrochemical storage solutions, including advanced chemistry batteries and capacitors, for the purpose of storing energy.  \n     \tCity building. The term \"city building\" has the same meaning as set out in section 28-309.2.  \n    \tCommissioner. The term \"commissioner\" means the commissioner of citywide administrative services.\n\tCost effective. The term \"cost effective\" means that the cumulative savings in energy costs expected to result from the use of a battery storage system, including expected savings will, in 25 years or less, equal or exceed the costs of acquisition, installation, and maintenance of such system, less all federal, state and other non-city governmental assistance and including the social cost of carbon value, as described in paragraphs 3 and 4 of subdivision d of section 3-125. A higher site- or project-specific social cost of carbon value may be developed and used in lieu of the social cost of carbon value. \n\tDepartment. The term \"department\" means the department of citywide administrative services.   \n      b. The department, or any other agency authorized by the commissioner, shall, within two years from the effective date of the local law that added this section, submit to the mayor and the council a feasibility study regarding the use of utility-scale battery storage systems for city buildings. The feasibility study shall include a review of any available federal or state funds or incentives for the acquisition, installation, operation or maintenance of such systems.\n      c. The department, or any other agency authorized by the commissioner, shall install, or cause to be installed, utility-scale battery storage systems on all city buildings where the feasibility study has found it cost-effective. \n      d. Not later than December 15 of the year following the submission of the feasibility study, and every second year thereafter, the department shall report to the mayor and the council the following:\n      1. The city buildings where the installation of a utility-scale battery storage system would be cost effective and the projected annual energy and other cost savings for each such system, both individually and in the aggregate.\n      2. The city buildings where installation of a utility-scale battery storage system has been commenced by the department or any other agency authorized by the commissioner.\n      3. The city buildings where the installation of a utility-scale battery storage system has been completed by the department or any other agency authorized by the commissioner, and the annual energy and other cost savings associated with the installation of such battery storage systems. \n      � 2. Report on feasibility of installation of utility-scale battery storage systems in non-city buildings. Not later than 2 years after the enactment of this local law, one or more offices or agencies designated by the mayor shall submit to the mayor and council, and make available to the public, a report on the feasibility of installing utility-scale battery storage systems throughout the city, not including city buildings as defined in section 28-309.2 of the administrative code of the city of New York. Such report shall also include, but need not be limited to, recommendations on where installation of utility-scale battery storage systems would be appropriate and identification of any financial or environmental benefits to the public that are associated with the installation of such systems. \n\t� 3. This local law takes effect immediately. \n\nMN\nLS #10603\n07/26/2017 10:28 AM \n      2\n      \n      \n      1\n      \n      \n         \n      - 2 -",
