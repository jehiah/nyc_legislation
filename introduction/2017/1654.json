  "Summary": "This bill would require the City to establish and maintain on its website, an interactive and searchable public database (updated on a monthly basis) containing information about all pending (non-completed) citywide capital projects. The database would include information for each project including the name, location and current phase, as well as information related to the project schedule and cost. It would also contain citywide capital project information including the total number of projects above/below cost and behind/ahead of schedule. Additionally, the website would contain an interactive map indicating the location of all projects listed in the database.",

The term \"baseline cost\" means the cost of a project as based on the original contract value and other project-related cost estimates. \n      Budget agency. The term \"budget agency\" means the agency from whose budget funds for the project's costs have been appropriated. \n      Cost variance. The term \"cost variance\" means the difference between the baseline cost from the current forecast cost.\n      Design phase. The term \"design phase\" means the period of time between the approval of a scope of project for a capital project and the approval of the final design of a capital project pursuant to chapter 9 of the charter.\n      Construction phase. The term \"construction phase\" means the period of time between the commencement of the performance of work by the contractor as defined in the contract and when such work has reached substantial completion.\n      Construction procurement phase. The term \"construction procurement phase\" means the period of time when procurement activities are underway to prepare a construction bid and award a contract, ending on the date on which both the contract has been signed and the notice to proceed has been issued.\n      Managing agency. The term \"managing agency\" means the agency that is responsible for functions and operations related to the project. \n      Schedule variance. The term \"schedule variance\" means the difference between the baseline completion date and the current forecast completion date. \n      b.
