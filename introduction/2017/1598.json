  "Summary": "The bill would require the Administration for Children’s Services (ACS) to provide to all families receiving preventive services an annual survey regarding their experiences with preventive services during the preceding calendar year. The surveys would ask questions about the family’s interactions with caseworkers, the type and quality of services and suggestions for how services may be improved. The bill would require ACS to submit to the Speaker of the Council a report on its plan on the implementation of the survey. The bill would also require ACS to aggregate the data from the surveys and any steps ACS has taken in response to the data and report it to the City Council and post it on their website on an annual basis.",

For the purposes of this section, the term \"preventive services\" means supportive and rehabilitative services provided, in accordance with title four of the social services law, to children and their families for the purposes of: averting an impairment or disruption of a family which will or could result in the placement of a child in foster care; enabling a child who has been placed in foster care to return to his family at an earlier time than would otherwise be possible; or reducing the likelihood that a child who has been discharged from foster care would return to such care.\n      b. Commencing 18 months after the effective date of the local law that added this section, ACS shall provide to all families receiving preventive services an annual survey regarding the family's experiences with each preventive services provider that provided the family services during the preceding calendar year. Such surveys may be administered online or through a mobile application. ACS shall not attribute survey responses to families without their consent. In addition to questions, such surveys shall provide space for such families to provide ACS with any additional information they wish to share. \n      c. Such survey shall include but not be limited to questions regarding the following: interactions with caseworkers, the type and quality of services, and suggestions for how services may be improved.\n      d.
