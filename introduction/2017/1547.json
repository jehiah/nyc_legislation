  "Summary": "This bill expands the current requirement to possess a retail dealer license to sell cigarettes to include all retailers that sell any type of tobacco products. The bill will also restrict the availability of new retail dealer licenses by capping the number of tobacco retailer licenses in each community district at half the current number. The community district caps would not affect existing licensees who may continue to renew their licenses.",
  "TextID": 60063,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Declaration of legislative findings and intent. The Council finds that tobacco use is a leading risk factor for preventable premature death in the United States and the City of New York, and that the City has a compelling interest in continuing its efforts to reduce tobacco use among adults and to prevent youth from starting to use tobacco products \n      Overall, the City has a high level of tobacco retail density with approximately 8,200 licensed cigarette retailers within approximately 300 square miles. The Council further finds, based on a number of studies, that easy access to tobacco retailers makes it harder for smokers to quit. In addition, weekly youth exposure to tobacco retail settings doubles the odds of youth smoking. Therefore, reducing the number of tobacco retailers over time is likely to reduce tobacco use and, in turn, morbidity. \n      The Council hereby declares that the enactment of this law is necessary to reduce the number of retailers selling tobacco products in New York City. This law will expand the scope of the existing retail dealer license for cigarettes to cover all tobacco products and restrict the availability of new retail dealer licenses, decreasing their numbers over time through attrition. \n      � 2. Paragraph 4 of subdivision a of section 17-177 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 67 for the year 1990, is amended to read as follows: \n      (4) \"Retail dealer\" means \"retail dealer\" as defined in section [11-1301 of the administrative code] 20-201.\n      � 3. Subdivision d of section 17-177 of the administrative code, as added by local law number 67 for the year 1990, is amended to read as follows:\n      d. Identification of vending machines. A wholesale dealer or retail dealer shall post a durable sign on any vending machine which such dealer is licensed to own, operate or maintain. Such sign shall be visible to the general public and provide the applicable [cigarette] license number and expiration date and the license holder's name, place of business and phone number.\n      � 4. Paragraph 1 of subdivision f of section 17-177 of the administrative code, as added by local law number 67 for the year 1990, is amended to read as follows:\n      (1) Any person found to be in violation of this section shall be liable for a civil penalty of not more than three hundred dollars for the first violation; not more than five hundred dollars for the second violation; and not more than one thousand dollars for the third and all subsequent violations. In addition, for a third and subsequent violations, any person who engages in business as a wholesale dealer or retail dealer shall be subject to the suspension of his or her [cigarette] license, for a period not to exceed one year, after notice and the opportunity for a hearing before the commissioner of finance or his or her designee. A wholesale dealer who owns, operates or maintains a vending machine placed in violation of subdivision b or paragraph (1) of subdivision c of this section shall be liable only if he or she has knowledge of the violation. The department shall promptly give written notice to the wholesale dealer identified on the sign required by subdivision d of this section of any such violation by an owner of the premises, or his or her employee or agent. For purposes of this section, such notice shall be prima facie evidence that the wholesale dealer has knowledge of future violations of subdivision b or paragraph (1) of subdivision c of this section.\n      � 5. Subdivision c of section 17-702 of the administrative code of the city of New York is REPEALED.\n      � 6. Subdivision b of section 17-716 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 97 for the year 2013, is amended to read as follows:\n      b.

Declaration of legislative findings and intent. The Council finds that tobacco use is a leading risk factor for preventable premature death in the United States and the City of New York, and that the City has a compelling interest in continuing its efforts to reduce tobacco use among adults and to prevent youth from starting to use tobacco products \\par\nOverall, the City has a high level of tobacco retail density with approximately 8,200 licensed cigarette retailers within approximately 300 square miles. The Council further finds, based on a number of studies, that easy access to tobacco retailers makes it harder for smokers to quit. In addition, weekly youth exposure to tobacco retail settings doubles the odds of youth smoking. Therefore, reducing the number of tobacco retailers over time is likely to reduce tobacco use and, in turn, morbidity. \\par\nThe Council hereby declares that the enactment of this law is necessary to reduce the number of retailers selling tobacco products in New York City. This law will expand the scope of the existing retail dealer license for cigarettes to cover all tobacco products and restrict the availability of new retail dealer licenses, decreasing their numbers over time through attrition. \\par\n\\'a7 2.

In addition, for a third and subsequent violations, any person who engages in business as a wholesale dealer or retail dealer shall be subject to the suspension of his or her [cigarette] license, for a period not to exceed one year, after notice and the opportunity for a hearing before the commissioner of finance or his or her designee.

The department shall promptly give written notice to the wholesale dealer identified on the sign required by subdivision d of this section of any such violation by an owner of the premises, or his or her employee or agent. For purposes of this section, such notice shall be prima facie evidence that the wholesale dealer has knowledge of future violations of subdivision b or paragraph (1) of subdivision c of this section.\\par\n\\'a7 5.
