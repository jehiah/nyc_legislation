In the case of commercial refuse containers, the bill would limit the number of permit renewals and, in the case of construction debris containers, it would require a permit from the Department of Buildings or a statement certifying that the construction work necessitating the use of such container does not require a permit.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n      Section 1. Section 19-121 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new subdivision d to read as follows:\n      d. No permit shall be granted pursuant to this section for a container used for construction debris unless the applicant for such permit submits to the department the location of the construction work necessitating the use of such container and either (i) a copy of a permit issued by the commissioner of buildings for such location or (ii) a statement certifying that the construction work necessitating the use of such container does not require a permit from the commissioner of buildings. \n      � 2. Section 19-123 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\n      � 19-123 Commercial refuse containers. It shall be unlawful for any person using a commercial refuse container or the owner or lessee thereof to place or to permit the placement of such container on any street unless the [owner of such container] person seeking to use such container has obtained a permit therefor from the commissioner and unless such container is in compliance with the provisions of this section and the rules of the department in relation thereto.  Such permit shall be for a period of seven days and can be renewed no more than two times.  Commercial refuse containers may be placed temporarily on the street for such purposes and in such manner as the commissioner shall prescribe. Such containers shall not be used for the deposit of putrescible waste. The name and address of the owner of the container and the permit number shall be posted on the container in the manner provided in the rules of the department. The container shall be painted with a phosphorescent substance, in a manner to be set forth in the rules of the department, so that the dimensions thereof shall be clearly discernible at night. The street under such container shall be shielded by wooden planking, skids or other protective covering approved by the commissioner.  The provisions of this section which require the [owner of a] person seeking to use a container to obtain a permit prior to the placement of such container on the street shall not apply to containers which are specifically authorized to be placed on the street under a permit issued pursuant to section 19-121 of this subchapter.\n      � 3.
