  "Summary": "The Citywide Statement of Needs is an annual statement of what city facilities the City expects to open, close, significantly expand or significantly shrink in the next two fiscal years.  This bill would require the Mayor every year to update the map and explanatory text (often called the Atlas and Gazetteer) that accompany the Citywide Statement of Needs, correcting existing confusion about how often updates are required.",
