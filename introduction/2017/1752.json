  "Summary": "This bill would create a class B misdemeanor for road rage. Road rage would be defined as engaging in violent or threatening behavior towards the operator or occupants of a qualifying vehicle, or against a pedestrian, while or immediately after operating a qualifying vehicle, or as a passenger thereof. Qualifying vehicles would include cars, motor vehicles and bicycles. Road rage could lead to property damage, personal injury and even death for participants and bystanders. This risk is significantly increased on city streets and highways, where motor vehicle and pedestrian traffic is particularly concentrated. Creating a road rage offense could deter and reduce the occurrence of these events and lead to safer streets for city drivers, bicyclists and pedestrians alike.",
