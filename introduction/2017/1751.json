The task force would consist of 13 members, seven of whom would be appointed by the Speaker of the Council. The remaining members would consist of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Commissioner of the Department of Parks and Recreation, the Commissioner of the Department of Design and Construction, the Commissioner of the Department of Cultural Affairs, and two additional members appointed by the Mayor.\r\n\r\nThe task force would be required to meet quarterly to examine issues such as the alignment of the capital commitment plan to the city’s ability to execute capital projects, any laws, policies or rules that may be impeding the efficiency of the capital project process, the certificate to proceed and contracting processes, and the establishment of a citywide capital project tracking system, among others.\r\n\r\nThe taskforce must submit a report to the Mayor and the Speaker by March 1, 2018, and revisit and revise such report every two years, containing an analysis of the capital projects process, recommendations for best practices, and a suggested timeline for implementation of any recommendations. In addition, the task force must submit an annual report to the Mayor and the Speaker detailing any progress made on the recommendations contained in the biennial report.",
