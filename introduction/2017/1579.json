  "Summary": "This bill restricts access to non-public areas of City property, as well as locations where human services contractors provide services. Under the bill, non-local government personnel authorized to enforce civil or criminal laws will not be permitted to access non-public areas of city property, unless: (1) the city has entered into an agreement, contract, or cooperative agreement granting access; (2) access is required by a judicial warrant or local, state, or federal law; (3) access furthers the purpose or mission of a city agency; or (4) exigent circumstances exist.\r\n\r\nThese access requirements would also apply to human services contractors, whether or not their services are provided on city property. Each agency would be required to provide free training to employees contracted for security services at covered City buildings. Finally, each agency would be required to establish and post online agency-specific guidelines or rules implementing the law.",
