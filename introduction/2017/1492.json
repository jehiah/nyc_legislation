  "Summary": "This bill would require online posting of statements outlining consistency or inconsistency with criteria established for siting city facilities whenever an agency (1) submits an application to the Department of City Planning involving a new facility; (2) files a notice to acquire office space; or (3) enters into a contract regarding any other facilities subject to the criteria. This bill is needed in order to enhance the disclosure of information to the public about city facility initiatives that impact their communities.",
