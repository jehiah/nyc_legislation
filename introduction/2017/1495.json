  "Summary": "The city strives to distribute facilities equitably under a process called “Fair Share,” but low-income communities are overburdened with certain types of facilities, such as waste transfer stations. Fair Share’s public disclosure tool—the Citywide Statement of Needs and its accompanying map—does not contain enough information geographic data to inform communities about facilities and where how communities compare to others. This bill would create an online mapping tool of city facilities subject to Fair Share as well as other facilities of interest to communities, including 1) federal and state health and social services facilities; and 2) private transportation and waste management facilities. Data used to create the mapping tool would be fully accessible to users for searches, content downloads and comparing community districts based on their relative concentrations of mapped facilities by use or type. Confidential information under state or federal law would be exempt from this bill.",

The department of city planning shall provide to the public at no charge on its website an interactive online mapping tool with explanatory textual and visual overlays indicating the specific locations, addresses and current or planned use of the following: \n      1. All city-owned real property; \n      2. All final commitments relating to the disposition or future use of city-owned real property, including assignments by the department of citywide administrative services pursuant to subdivision (b) of section 824;\n      3.

City facilities that the city plans to close or to reduce significantly in size or in capacity for service delivery during the ensuing two fiscal years.\n      b. Accessibility. The mapping tool shall be publicly accessible 24 hours per day, seven days per week.\n      c. Designation of facility uses. For each mapped facility, the department of city planning shall indicate with textual and visual overlays all applicable current and proposed uses based on: \n\t1. Designations constituting one or more of the types of facilities contained in the illustrative listing in attachments A, B and C to the criteria for the location of city facilities as adopted pursuant to section 203; \n      2. The use codes and types used by the department of citywide administrative services to categorize city owned and leased properties; and\n      3. If the type or use of a mapped facility is unknown, it shall be marked temporarily as unknown until the department obtains such information.\n      d. Guide to facility uses. The webpage containing the mapping tool, or a webpage available through a prominently displayed link on such webpage, shall provide a brief guide describing each of the designated facility types and uses included on the mapping tool pursuant to subdivision c of this section. \n      e. Facility concentrations by community district. For each community district, the department of city planning shall determine the relative concentrations of mapped facilities by each use designated pursuant to subdivision c of this section. Relative concentrations shall be based on the ratio of facility capacity per thousand population in each community district, and, if the type of facility in question targets or serves a particular segment of the population, based on the ratio of facility capacity per thousand of such population. \n      f. Interactivity. The mapping tool shall permit unique users to search for and visually highlight any user-specified category or categories of facilities within or among one or multiple community districts based on facility type, use and relative concentration levels. Additional interactive functions shall be assessed by the department of city planning on an annual basis.\n      g. Open data. The webpage that contains the mapping tool, or a webpage available through a prominently displayed link on such webpage, shall provide mapping data in a non-proprietary format that permits automated downloading and processing.\n      h. Updates. The department of city planning shall update the online mapping tool at least annually to coincide with the timing prescribed in subdivision a of section 204 for the mayor's submission of the citywide statement of needs.\n      i. Confidentiality. No information that is otherwise required to be reported or mapped pursuant to this section shall be done in a manner that would violate any applicable provision of federal, state or local law relating to the confidentiality of information or that would interfere with law enforcement investigations or otherwise conflict with the interests of law enforcement.\n      � 3.
