  "Summary": "The proposed legislation would require educational continuity materials and information be provided to families with children applying for shelter during the intake process at an intake facility, such as the Prevention Assistance and Temporary Housing (PATH) intake center. The Department of Homeless would permit Department of Education (DOE) staff access to such intake facilities for the purpose of holding discussions with shelter applicants on educational opportunity. Such staff would inform shelter applicants about the rights of homeless students with respect to educational rights and transportation, early childhood care, early childhood education and early intervention services. Staff would provide families with information on students’ rights under the federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act and any information provided to families would include contact information for DOE. In the event a representative of DOE is unavailable to hold such a discussion, contact information for relevant staff at DOE would be provided to a shelter applicant along with written materials and information.",
