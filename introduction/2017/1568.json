  "Summary": "The bill would prohibit City agencies from partnering with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to enforce federal immigration law, including through 287(g) agreements.  Additionally, this bill would prohibit the use of City resources, property, and information obtained on behalf of the City in furtherance of federal immigration enforcement. The bill would also require any requests for assistance by federal immigration enforcement agencies to documented and later compiled into an anonymized report sent quarterly to the Council. The bill would not restrict the City from participating in cooperative agreements with federal officials, so long as such agreements are not primarily intended to further immigration enforcement.",
