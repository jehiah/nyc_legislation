  "Summary": "The bill would prohibit City agencies from partnering with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to enforce federal immigration law, including through 287(g) agreements.

The bill would also require any requests for assistance by federal immigration enforcement agencies to documented and later compiled into an anonymized report sent quarterly to the Council. The bill would not restrict the City from participating in cooperative agreements with federal officials, so long as such agreements are not primarily intended to further immigration enforcement.",

Chapter 1 of title 10 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 10-178 to read as follows:\t\n      � 10-178 Immigration enforcement. a. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms have the following meanings:\n      City property.
