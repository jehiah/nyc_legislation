  "Summary": "Sightseeing tour buses can be challenging to operate for drivers who are expected to simultaneously narrate tours and otherwise interact with, entertain and attend to their passengers. The distractions associated with these competing duties could lead to traffic violations, accidents and even injuries for passengers, other vehicles and pedestrians alike. Moreover, these distractions and safety concerns may be more pronounced for double-decker tour buses because they accommodate twice as many passengers on separate levels. This law would require double decker sightseeing tour buses to have one owner representative on the upper deck of the bus in addition to the driver at all times when passengers are present on the upper deck. This requirement could help to alleviate distractions to drivers, thereby creating a safer environment on NYC streets.",
