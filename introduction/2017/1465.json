  "Summary": "This bill would accelerate the timeline for such plants to shift from using higher grade fuel oil (e.g. fuel oil grade number 6 or 4) to lower grade fuel oil (fuel oil grade number 2). Currently, power plants can burn fuel oil grade number 6 until 2020 and fuel oil grade number 4 until 2030. Under this bill, plant owners would have the option of either (1) continuing to burn fuel oil grade number 6 until 2021, but switching immediately thereafter to fuel oil grade number 2 or (2) switching from fuel oil grade number 4 to fuel oil grade number 2 by 2025 (instead of 2030).",
