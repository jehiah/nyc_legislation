  "Summary": "The proposed legislation that would require the Department of Transportation (DOT) to print on parking signs the link of a website where drivers can obtain information regarding scheduled sporting or cultural events that would affect parking regulation around a stadium or arena where the parking sign is located. Currently, vehicles in the vicinity of stadiums or arenas, such as Yankee stadium, can be towed because they are parked while “no parking” regulation are in effect due to a “Stadium Event.” However, owners of these vehicles have no way to know in advance when an event that would necessitate a change in parking regulations is taking place.",
