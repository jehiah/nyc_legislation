  "Summary": "This bill would prohibit any person from advertising or holding oneself out as being affiliated with a base station or dispatch service provider (“DSP”) unless: (1) such person holds a valid Taxi and Limousine Commission (“TLC”) universal driver’s license; (2) such person operates a TLC-licensed for-hire vehicle (“FHV”); and (3) the base station or DSP is authorized to dispatch the FHV. This bill also prohibits any person who operates a FHV from soliciting or accepting a passenger who has engaged a FHV on the basis of telephone contract or prearrangement, unless a base station or DSP has dispatched such person’s FHV to pick up such passenger and such prearrangement is evidenced by records. Civil penalties for violations of both prohibitions are provided. Further, the bill modifies the two-year period for moving to vacate a default decision by OATH.  The bill also clarifies and strengthens provisions related to illegally operating non-TLC licensed vehicles for hire.",
