The exemptions function by exempting a percentage of the assessed value (between five and 50 percent) of qualifying real property from taxation on a sliding scale based on income. Currently, in order to be eligible for either exemption, the combined income of the property owners must be less than $37,400.\r\n\r\nOn July 25, 2017, the State enacted legislation authorizing the City to increase the eligible income threshold for both SCHE and DHE to $58,400.","TextID":60049,"Text":"Preconsidered Int.

Paragraph (a) of subdivision 3 of section 11-245.4 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 41 for the year 2006, is amended to read as follows:\\par\n(a) if the income of the owner or the combined income of the owners of the property for the income tax year immediately preceding the date of making application for exemption exceeds the sum of twenty-six thousand dollars beginning July first, two thousand six, twenty-seven thousand dollars beginning July first, two thousand seven, twenty-eight thousand dollars beginning July first, two thousand eight, [and] twenty-nine thousand dollars beginning July first, two thousand nine\\ul , and fifty thousand dollars beginning July first, two thousand seventeen\\ulnone . Income tax year shall mean the twelve month period for which the owner or owners filed a federal personal income tax return, or if no such return is filed, the calendar year. Where title is vested in either the husband or the wife, their combined income may not exceed such sum, except where the husband or wife, or ex-husband or ex-wife is absent from the property due to divorce, legal separation or abandonment, then only the income of the spouse or ex-spouse residing on the property shall be considered and may not exceed such sum. Such income shall include social security and retirement benefits, interest, dividends, total gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset which may be offset by a loss from the sale or exchange of a capital asset in the same income tax year, net rental income, salary or earnings, and net income from self-employment, but shall not include a return of capital, gifts, inheritances or monies earned through employment in the federal foster grandparent program and any such income shall be offset by all medical and prescription drug expenses actually paid which were not reimbursed or paid for by insurance. In computing net rental income and net income from self-employment no depreciation deduction shall be allowed for the exhaustion, wear and tear of real or personal property held for the production of income[.]\\ul ;\\ulnone\\par\n\\'a7 4.
