It will mandate that used car dealers disclose certain information to consumers, including: i) the itemized prices of add-on products; ii) the total cost of the vehicle, broken down by monthly payments and with or without any add-ons; iii) the lowest interest rate (APR) offered to the consumer by a finance company; and iv) any other financing-related disclosures the Commissioner prescribes by rule.  Any required documents or disclosures to be provided to a consumer must be in the language used to negotiate the contract for sale. In addition, this bill requires dealers to offer an “automobile contract cancellation option” that would allow a buyer to cancel a contract for sale, subject to some limitations, within two days of purchasing the used vehicle. During the cancellation period, the purchased used car remains on the dealer’s lot until the consumer makes a decision. A dealer is required to retain certain records related to the sale of used cars for six years, which may be subject to audit by the department of consumer affairs. The bill also gives the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer Affairs the discretion to report to the City Council and the Mayor on the effectiveness of the bill. Finally, this bill creates additional civil penalties for the violation of its provisions.","TextID":59428,"Text":"Int.

Prior to executing a bill of sale with a consumer for the purchase of an automobile, a second-hand automobile dealer shall offer such consumer an automobile contract cancellation option that authorizes such consumer to cancel the sales contract, subject to the conditions set forth in this section. Until such option is declined in writing or forfeited by such consumer, such dealer may retain possession of and title to such automobile.\n      b.

The submission of proof of a cure shall be deemed an admission of liability for all purposes. The option of presenting proof that the violation has been cured shall be offered as part of any settlement offer made by the department to a person who has received, for the first time, a notice of violation of section 20-270 or section 20-271 of this subchapter or any rule or regulation issued thereunder.

In determining whether to order such payment and the amount of such payment, the commissioner shall consider, but is not limited to, the following factors:\n      1. Any prior violation of subdivision e of section 20-268.2 by such dealer;\n      2.
