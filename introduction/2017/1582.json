  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Social Services/Human Resources Administration (HRA) to create a list of “inclusive landlords” who (i) have affirmatively agreed not to discriminate against tenants and potential tenants based on their lawful source of income and have not been determined to have done so in the previous two years and (ii) have an adequate to excellent record of housing maintenance. HRA would be required to proactively ask landlords whether they would like to participate, and participation would be voluntary.",
