It will mandate that used car dealers disclose certain information to consumers, including: i) the itemized prices of add-on products; ii) the total cost of the vehicle, broken down by monthly payments and with or without any add-ons; iii) the lowest interest rate (APR) offered to the consumer by a finance company; and iv) any other financing-related disclosures the Commissioner prescribes by rule.

In addition, this bill requires dealers to offer an “automobile contract cancellation option” that would allow a buyer to cancel a contract for sale, subject to some limitations, within two days of purchasing the used vehicle. During the cancellation period, the purchased used car remains on the dealer’s lot until the consumer makes a decision. A dealer is required to retain certain records related to the sale of used cars for six years, which may be subject to audit by the department of consumer affairs. The bill also gives the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer Affairs the discretion to report to the City Council and the Mayor on the effectiveness of the bill.

The distractions associated with these competing duties could lead to traffic violations, accidents and even injuries for passengers, other vehicles and pedestrians alike.

This law would require double decker sightseeing tour buses to have one owner representative on the upper deck of the bus in addition to the driver at all times when passengers are present on the upper deck. This requirement could help to alleviate distractions to drivers, thereby creating a safer environment on NYC streets.","LastModified":"2017-12-23T05:19:31.457Z"}

Since June 2017, TSP is active at 260 intersections on five bus routes. \r\n\r\nDue to the myriad of transportation issues facing New Yorkers, this proposed local law would require DOT, to the extent practicable in cooperation with relevant city and state agencies including the MTA, to upgrade at least ten bus routes per year over the next four years to TSP.

Exonerees face many of the same hurdles as other released prisoners, including obtaining housing, employment and medical care. However, exonerees are often ineligible for reentry services that states provide to parolees and released prisoners. Wrongful convictions also take an economic and emotional toll on the families of the accused. Under New York State law, compensation for wrongful conviction and imprisonment does not include the provision of social services. \r\n\r\nThis bill would require the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice (MOCJ) to coordinate with relevant City agencies to promote the availability of social services for wrongfully convicted individuals and their immediate family members. MOCJ would also be required to develop methods to increase the coordination of such social services, and provide outreach and education on the availability of such services for exonerees and their immediate family members.","LastModified":"2017-12-20T23:13:32.447Z"}
