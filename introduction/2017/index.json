The new criteria would prohibit siting a city facility, including emergency contracted facilities, in any community district highly concentrated with such facilities. High concentration means the top 10% of community districts with the highest ratios of capacity of similar facilities to district population. An agency proposing a siting could overcome the prohibition by demonstrating the facility serves particular needs of the community, except where need was created by unfair overconcentration of similar existing facilities. Sitings exempted from the prohibition based on need would be subject to a recorded vote by the CPC and subsequent Council review. Prohibited sitings would be reported to the Council, and the status of sitings made under the need-based exemption would be tracked on an online database updated annually.","LastModified":"2017-12-23T04:44:36.377Z"}

It will mandate that used car dealers disclose certain information to consumers, including: i) the itemized prices of add-on products; ii) the total cost of the vehicle, broken down by monthly payments and with or without any add-ons; iii) the lowest interest rate (APR) offered to the consumer by a finance company; and iv) any other financing-related disclosures the Commissioner prescribes by rule.  Any required documents or disclosures to be provided to a consumer must be in the language used to negotiate the contract for sale. In addition, this bill requires dealers to offer an “automobile contract cancellation option” that would allow a buyer to cancel a contract for sale, subject to some limitations, within two days of purchasing the used vehicle. During the cancellation period, the purchased used car remains on the dealer’s lot until the consumer makes a decision. A dealer is required to retain certain records related to the sale of used cars for six years, which may be subject to audit by the department of consumer affairs. The bill also gives the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer Affairs the discretion to report to the City Council and the Mayor on the effectiveness of the bill. Finally, this bill creates additional civil penalties for the violation of its provisions.","LastModified":"2018-01-02T16:58:12.023Z"}

Additionally, the bill would provide an exemption for any property for which the owner has, in good faith, submitted a pending initial or renewal application for a not-for-profit property tax exemption pursuant to the above sections with the Department of Finance (DOF), as well as any property for which the owner is appealing the denial of such an exemption with the Tax Commission. The bill would also require notice to owners of Class 4 properties of the availability of exemptions and other actions to remove a property from the sale, as well as mandate certain other changes to the lien sale notice. Furthermore, the bill would require DOF to include information about how to remove a property from the lien sale when denying an application for certain exemptions. Finally, the bill would require DOF to report to the Council (within 90 days) on the total number and value of liens included in specified lien sales that would have otherwise been exempt due to not-for-profit or another status.","LastModified":"2017-12-23T05:19:12.53Z"}

The distractions associated with these competing duties could lead to traffic violations, accidents and even injuries for passengers, other vehicles and pedestrians alike. Moreover, these distractions and safety concerns may be more pronounced for double-decker tour buses because they accommodate twice as many passengers on separate levels. This law would require double decker sightseeing tour buses to have one owner representative on the upper deck of the bus in addition to the driver at all times when passengers are present on the upper deck. This requirement could help to alleviate distractions to drivers, thereby creating a safer environment on NYC streets.","LastModified":"2017-12-23T05:19:31.457Z"}

Since 2012, the New York City Department of Transportation (DOT) and Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) have collaborated on a component of BRT called Traffic Signal Priority (TSP). TSP is a technology that is capable of enhancing traditional transit services by facilitating bus movements through intersections controlled by traffic signals. Since June 2017, TSP is active at 260 intersections on five bus routes. \r\n\r\nDue to the myriad of transportation issues facing New Yorkers, this proposed local law would require DOT, to the extent practicable in cooperation with relevant city and state agencies including the MTA, to upgrade at least ten bus routes per year over the next four years to TSP. This would double their current planned pace.","LastModified":"2017-12-29T21:38:24.027Z"}

More than 10 percent of exonerations have come from New York State. Those New Yorkers spent an average of 9.18 years in prison for crimes they did not commit. Exonerees face many of the same hurdles as other released prisoners, including obtaining housing, employment and medical care. However, exonerees are often ineligible for reentry services that states provide to parolees and released prisoners. Wrongful convictions also take an economic and emotional toll on the families of the accused. Under New York State law, compensation for wrongful conviction and imprisonment does not include the provision of social services. \r\n\r\nThis bill would require the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice (MOCJ) to coordinate with relevant City agencies to promote the availability of social services for wrongfully convicted individuals and their immediate family members. MOCJ would also be required to develop methods to increase the coordination of such social services, and provide outreach and education on the availability of such services for exonerees and their immediate family members.","LastModified":"2017-12-20T23:13:32.447Z"}

Consumers pay for health insurance to provide coverage and reduce costs and they should be aware when their insurance unnecessarily restricts access to important information or necessary prescriptions. Accordingly, the signs would notify customers that the price of a drug, if purchased without using insurance, might be less than the cost of a co-pay if purchased using insurance.","LastModified":"2017-12-20T22:49:13.383Z"}
