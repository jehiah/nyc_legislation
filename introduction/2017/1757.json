  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Education (DOE) to report every six months on the number of material incidents of student-to-student bullying, harassment, intimidation or discrimination in violation of Chancellor’s Regulation A-832, as well as the number of complaints received, disaggregated by community school district and individual high school. The bill would also require the DOE to annually report on supports it provides related to preventing, reporting, and addressing such incidents, any trends seen in the data, any recommendations the DOE has to address such trends, and, for each school, whether the school has completed the training required pursuant to Chancellor’s Regulation A-832.  Beginning with the report due on May 31, 2020, the bi-annual reports would be required to include information on the total number of notices provided to parents and the average and median number of days between the receipt of a complaint and the provision of a notice. Additionally, the bill would require the reports to include information on the number of students who have been determined by the DOE to be involved in two or more material incidents within a school year, and of those students, the number of students for whom follow-up action was recommended, and a description of the follow-up action recommended. The information required by the reports beginning in May 2020 would be required to be disaggregated by whether students were targeted by bullying, harassment, intimidation or discrimination, or were engaged in bullying, harassment, intimidation or discrimination.",
