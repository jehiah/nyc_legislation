The term \"hit-and-run\" means when any driver who, knowing or having cause to know that serious physical injury has been caused to another person due to an incident involving the driver's motor vehicle, leaves the scene of an incident without complying with all of the provisions of paragraph a of subdivision two of section six hundred of the vehicle and traffic law.\n      Serious physical injury.

The hit-and-run alert may be issued at repeated intervals within the discretion of the administering agency until the perpetrator involved in such hit-and-run has been located or until the administering agency determines that the issuance of a hit-and-run alert is no longer appropriate.\n      � 2.
