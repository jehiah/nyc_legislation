  "Summary": "Bus rapid transit (BRT) is a system that is designed to make bus service faster, more reliable and efficient through features such as off-board fare payment, dedicated bus lanes and giving priority to buses at intersections. Since 2012, the New York City Department of Transportation (DOT) and Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) have collaborated on a component of BRT called Traffic Signal Priority (TSP). TSP is a technology that is capable of enhancing traditional transit services by facilitating bus movements through intersections controlled by traffic signals. Since June 2017, TSP is active at 260 intersections on five bus routes. \r\n\r\nDue to the myriad of transportation issues facing New Yorkers, this proposed local law would require DOT, to the extent practicable in cooperation with relevant city and state agencies including the MTA, to upgrade at least ten bus routes per year over the next four years to TSP. This would double their current planned pace.",
