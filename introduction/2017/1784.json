  "Summary": "This bill would require the city to plow city sidewalks after four inches of snow accumulate. The removal of sidewalk snow accumulations up to four inches would remain the responsibility of landowners whose properties abut sidewalks but the city would be required to remove snow at the landowner’s expense if necessary. By plowing sidewalks after four inches of snow accumulate, the city would be helping private landowners to provide safer walking conditions on city sidewalks after heavier snowfalls.",
