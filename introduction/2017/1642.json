  "Summary": "The bill would require that any individuals or families receiving rental assistance vouchers established by the Department of Social Services, such as the current LINC, CityFEPS and SEPS vouchers, would continue to receive the assistance so long as the household continues to meet any other eligibility requirements. The bill would also require that the maximum rent toward which rental assistance vouchers may be applied annually increases at the same rate as the fair market rents set by the United States Department of Housing Preservation and Development. The requirements set by the bill would be subject to appropriation.",
