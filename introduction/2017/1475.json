  "Summary": "This bill would change the Taxi and Limousine Commission’s (TLC) authority to revoke taxicab licenses for nonuse from mandatory to permissive. \r\n\r\nThis bill would repeal the provision requiring that the ratio of the total number of taxicab licenses held by owners of more than one taxicab license and the total number of taxicab license held by the owners of one taxicab license remain the same. \r\n\r\nThis bill would repeal the provision requiring a bond to be filed for outstanding tort liabilities for the transfer of a taxicab license.",

The commission [shall] may revoke any license for nonuse in the event it shall determine that the vehicle has not been operated for sixty consecutive days, provided that such failure to operate shall not have been caused by strike, riot, war or other public catastrophe or other act beyond the control of the owner; or in the event the owner has sold his or her vehicle and has failed to replace the vehicle within one hundred and twenty days from the date of sale. However, in the event that it is shown to the commission by competent proof that an owner-driver has been disabled through illness, his or her license shall not be revoked because of such nonuse as provided in this subdivision.\n         �2.
