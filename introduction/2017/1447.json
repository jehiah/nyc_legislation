Except as otherwise specified in this code or other law, violations of this code, the 1968 building code, the zoning resolution or other laws or rules enforced by the department shall be punishable by civil penalties within the ranges set forth below:\n1. \tFor immediately hazardous violations, a civil penalty of not less than one thousand dollars nor more than $25,000 may be imposed for each violation. In addition to such civil penalty, a separate additional penalty may be imposed of not more than $1,000 for each day that the violation is not corrected. The commissioner may by rule establish such specified daily penalties.\n2. \tFor major violations, a civil penalty of not more than $10,000 may be imposed for each violation. In addition to such civil penalty, a separate additional penalty may be imposed of not more than $250 for each month that the violation is not corrected. The commissioner may by rule establish such specified monthly penalties.\n3. \tFor lesser violations, a civil penalty of not more than $500 may be imposed for each violation.\nExceptions:\n1.  The owner, lessee, occupant, manager or operator of a building affected by a natural or man-made disaster, as determined by the commissioner, shall not be subject to a civil penalty for a violation involving such building if (i) notice of such violation is issued by the department during the 90-day period immediately after such disaster or, in the case of a major natural or man-made disaster as determined by the commissioner, during the six-month period immediately after such disaster, and (ii) such violation is corrected on or before 40 days after such disaster period or such greater amount of time as determined by the commissioner for such violation. The notice of such violation shall state that such violation is subject to this exception and shall set forth the procedure and time period for correcting such violation without incurring a civil penalty. This exception shall not apply to immediately hazardous violations, violations charged as aggravated violations or violations without connection to such disaster, as determined by the department.\n2.  The owner, lessee, occupant, manager or operator of a building where a violation occurs shall not be subject to a civil penalty for such violation if (i) such violation was connected to a natural or man-made disaster, as determined by the commissioner, and (ii) such building is undergoing, or scheduled or under evaluation for, work or acquisition through a city-operated disaster recovery program responding to such disaster.\n3.  The owner, lessee, occupant, manager or operator of a building shall not be subject to a civil penalty for a violation resulting from work done by a city employee, or by a third party under contract with the city, in response to a natural or man-made disaster, provided that such violation is corrected on or before 60 days after the issuance of such violation, or such greater amount of time as determined by the commissioner for such violation. If such owner, lessee, occupant, manager or operator of a building can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the department that a city employee or third party under contract with the city has committed to correcting such violation then such violation shall be rescinded, without penalty. The notice of such violation shall state that such violation is subject to this exception and shall set forth the procedure and time period for correcting such violation without incurring a civil penalty. This exception shall not apply to immediately hazardous violations or violations charged as aggravated violations.\n4.  The minimum civil penalty for a violation of section 28-408.1 or section 28-410.1 of this code shall be $2,500 for a first violation and $5,000 for a second violation, in addition to any separate daily penalty imposed pursuant to item 1 of this section.\n5.\tFor a violation of section 28-210.1:\n\n5.1. Unless exception 5.2 applies, the minimum civil penalty for a violation of section 28-210.1 in any building involving the illegal conversion, maintenance or occupancy of three or more dwelling units above the number of dwelling units that is legally authorized by the certificate of occupancy or if no certificate of occupancy is required as evidenced by official records shall be $15,000. Each dwelling unit above the number that is legally authorized by the certificate of occupancy or if no certificate of occupancy is required as evidenced by official records shall constitute a separate offense that shall be charged separately and shall be punishable by a separate civil penalty. Provided, however, that the penalties for multiple violations of this exception may be based on the same evidence; and\n\n5.2. The owner of a building shall not be subject to a civil penalty for a violation of section 28-210.1 in such building if such owner can show the following: \n\n5.2.1. Such violation was the first such violation issued for such building or was issued within 30 days after such first violation;\n\n5.2.2. At the time such violation was issued or, if such violation was issued within 30 days after such first violation was issued, the time such first violation was issued, a registration for such building has been properly filed with the department of housing preservation and development in accordance with article two of subchapter 4 of the housing maintenance code; and\n\n5.2.3. At the time such violation was issued or, if such violation was issued within 30 days after such first violation was issued, the time such first violation was issued, such owner reasonably did not know of, or could not reasonably have known of such illegal conversion, the maintenance thereof or occupancy thereof and takes lawful immediate and diligent steps to cure said violation.\n\n6.  The minimum civil penalty for a violation of section 3321.1 of the New York city building code shall be $5,000. The department may by rule provide that, for a first violation of such section or a first set of such violations that occur substantially at the same time, the minimum penalty may be reduced to $2,500. \n\n7.  \tThe minimum civil penalty for a violation of section 3321.2 of the New York city building code shall be $2,500.\n\n      � 7. Article 204 of title 28 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 28-204.1.1 to read as follows:\n� 28-204.1.1 Violations of section 3321 of the New York city building code. In addition to any other penalties or remedies provided by law or rule, the following items shall apply to violations of section 3321 of the New York city building code:\n\n1.\tUpon determining that a worker at a building site is not in compliance with section 3321.1 of the New York city building code: \n\n1.1. The commissioner shall issue a notice of violation to the owner of such site, each permit holder responsible for ensuring that such worker complies with such section at such site and the person who employed or otherwise engaged such worker at such site if such person can reasonably be identified. Each such worker shall constitute a separate violation that shall be noticed and charged separately and shall be punishable by a separate civil penalty. It shall be an affirmative defense to such a violation that such worker provided such owner, permit holder or the person who employed or otherwise engaged such worker at such site with an SST card, SST supervisor card, limited SST card, temporary SST card or documentation establishing training in compliance with such section, as appropriate, that reasonably appeared to be valid and applicable to such worker and such owner, permit holder or such person reasonably relied thereon.\n\n1.2. In addition to the requirements of any other law or rule, such violation shall not be deemed corrected until the commissioner determines that, for each such worker, the recipient of such violation shows, in a form and manner established by the commissioner, that such owner, a person acting on behalf of such owner, a permit holder responsible for ensuring that such worker complies with such section at such site or the person who employed or otherwise engaged such worker at such site has entered into a binding agreement that satisfies each of the following conditions:\n\n1.2.1. Pursuant to such agreement, such owner, a person acting on behalf of such owner or a permit holder responsible for ensuring that such worker complies with such section at such site or the person who employed or otherwise engaged such worker at such site shall pay, either directly or indirectly, for the costs of such worker to obtain the training required to comply with such section or will otherwise arrange for such worker to receive such training at no cost to such worker.\n\n1.2.2.
