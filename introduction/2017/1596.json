The term \"expanded  polystyrene\"  means  blown  polystyrene  and  expanded and extruded  foams that are thermoplastic petrochemical materials utilizing a styrene monomer and processed by any number of techniques including, but not limited to, fusion of polymer spheres (expandable bead foam), injection molding, foam molding, and extrusion-blown molding (extruded foam polystyrene). Such term shall not include rigid polystyrene.\n      [\"Food] Food service establishment. The term \"food service establishment\" means a premises or part of a premises where food is provided directly to the consumer  whether  such  food  is provided  free  of  charge or sold, and whether consumption occurs on or off the premises or is provided from a pushcart, stand or vehicle.

The term \"single service articles\" means cups, containers, lids, closures, trays, plates, knives, spoons, stoppers, paddles, straws, place mats, napkins, doilies, wrapping  materials, toothpicks  and all similar articles that are intended by the manufacturer to be used once for eating or  drinking or that are generally recognized by the public as items to be discarded after one use.\n      [\"Store\"] Store.

Such financial hardship waiver shall be valid for [twelve] 12 months and shall be renewable upon application to the commissioner of small business services.
