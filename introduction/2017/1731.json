  "Summary": "Inoperable fire hydrants pose a significant safety risk to the lives of New York City residents. Fire hydrant repair is the responsibility of the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). The identification of and timely repair of inoperable fire hydrants is a priority for the city. This local law would require DEP to repair high-priority hydrants, including those near a hospital, school, senior-citizen housing and others as determined by DEP, within seven calendar days of receiving a complaint and to repair non-priority hydrants within 10 calendar days. This law would also require DEP to establish written standards for handling fire hydrant complaints and to report to the Council.",
