  "Summary": "The 2002 living wage law requires City service contractors and subcontractors that provide homecare services, day care services, Head Start services or services to persons with cerebral palsy to pay employees a living wage. Thousands of other City-contracted human services workers are not covered by the law. The proposed bill would expand the living wage law to cover all human services employees working under a City contract. The bill would also cover building service workers engaged by a City service contractor that provides contracted human services on its premises to assist in performing the City contract. Additionally, the bill would provide the Department of Consumer Affairs (“DCA”), rather than the contracting agencies, enforcement authority over the 2002 living wage law. The bill would also grant DCA authority to conduct an inquiry into the results of the Comptroller’s investigations, if necessary, in assessing the appropriate remedy for violations of the living wage laws.",

In conducting such investigation, the comptroller shall have the same investigatory, hearing, and other powers as are conferred on the comptroller by sections 234 and 235 of the [state] labor law. At the start of such investigation, the comptroller may, in a manner consistent with the withholding procedures established by section 235.2 of the [state] labor law, instruct or, in the case of [homecare services, day care services, head start services or services to persons with cerebral palsy] human services, advise the relevant contracting agency to withhold any payment due the covered employer in order to safeguard the rights of the covered employees. Provided, however, that in the case of city service contractors providing human services [to persons with cerebral palsy, day care or head start services], no such withholding of payment may be ordered until such time as the comptroller or [contracting agency] the commissioner, as applicable, has issued an order, determination or other disposition finding a violation of this section and the city service contractor has failed to cure the violation in a timely fashion. Based upon such investigation, hearing, and findings, the comptroller shall report the results of such investigation and hearing to the [contracting agency] commissioner, who shall issue such order, determination or other disposition. Such disposition may:\n      (i) Direct payment of wages and/or the monetary equivalent of benefits wrongly denied, including interest from the date of the underpayment to the [worker] covered employee, based on the rate of interest per year then in effect as prescribed by the superintendent of banks pursuant to section 14-a of the [state] banking law, but in any event at a rate no less than six percent per year;\n      (ii) Direct the filing or disclosure of any records that were not filed or made available to the public as required by this section;\n      (iii) Direct the reinstatement of, or other appropriate relief for, any person found to have been subject to retaliation or discrimination in violation of this section;\n      (iv) Direct payment of a further sum as a civil penalty in an amount not exceeding [twenty-five] 25 percent of the total amount found to be due in violation of this section;\n      (v) Direct payment of the sums withheld at the commencement of the investigation and the interest that has accrued thereon to the covered employer; and\n      (vi) Declare a finding of non-responsibility and bar the covered employer from receiving city service contracts from the contracting agency for a prescribed period of time.\n      In assessing an appropriate remedy, [a contracting agency] the commissioner shall give due consideration to the size of the employer's business, the employer's good faith, the gravity of the violation, the history of previous violations and the failure to comply with record-keeping, reporting, anti-retaliation or other non-wage requirements. The commissioner may conduct an inquiry related to the results of the investigation conducted by the comptroller pursuant to this subparagraph, if necessary, in assessing an appropriate remedy. Any civil penalty shall be deposited in the city general revenue fund.\n      (c) Before issuing an order, determination or any other disposition, the comptroller or [contracting agency] the commissioner, as applicable, shall give notice thereof together with a copy of the complaint, or a statement of the facts disclosed upon investigation, which notice shall be served personally or by mail on any person or covered employer affected thereby. The comptroller or [contracting agency] the commissioner, as applicable, may negotiate an agreed upon stipulation of settlement or refer the matter to the office of administrative trials and hearings for a hearing and disposition. Such person or covered employer shall be notified of a hearing date by the office of administrative trials and hearings and shall have the opportunity to be heard in respect to such matters.\n      (d) In an investigation conducted under the provisions of this section, the inquiry of the comptroller or [contracting agency] the commissioner, as applicable, shall not extend to work performed more than three years prior to the filing of the complaint, or the commencement of such investigation, whichever is earlier.\n      (f) When a final determination has been made in favor of a covered employee or other person and the person found violating this section has failed to comply with the payment or other terms of the remedial order of the comptroller or [contracting agency] the commissioner, as applicable, and provided that no proceeding for judicial review shall then be pending and the time for initiation of such proceeding shall have expired, the comptroller or [contracting agency] the commissioner, as applicable, shall file a copy of such order containing the amount found to be due with the city clerk of the county of residence or place of business of the person found to have violated this section, or of any principal or officer thereof who knowingly participated in the violation of this section. The filing of such order shall have the full force and effect of a judgment duly docketed in the office of such clerk. The order may be enforced by and in the name of the comptroller or [contracting agency] the commissioner, as applicable, in the same manner and with like effect as that prescribed by the state civil practice law and rules for the enforcement of a money judgment.\n      (h) The comptroller or [any contracting agency] the commissioner shall be authorized to contract with non-governmental agencies to investigate possible violations of this section. Where a covered employer is found to have violated the requirements of this section, the covered employer shall be liable to the city for costs incurred in investigating and prosecuting the violation.\n      � 9. Paragraph (1) of subdivision f of section 6-109 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 38 for the year 2002, is amended to read as follows:\n      (1) Except where expressly provided otherwise in this section, the requirements of this section shall apply to city service contracts entered into after the effective date of this section, and shall not apply to any existing city service contract entered into prior to that date. Where a city service contract is renewed or extended after the effective date of this section, such renewal or extension shall be deemed new city service contracts and shall trigger coverage under this section if the terms of the renewed or extended city service contract[,] otherwise meet the requirements for coverage under this section. [However, city service contractors and city service subcontractors that provide services to persons with cerebral palsy, day care services or head start services shall be subject to the requirements of this section only upon the award or renewal of city service contracts after the effective date of this section. City service contractors and city service subcontractors that provide homecare services shall be subject to the requirements of this section immediately upon the effective date of this section.]\n      � 10. Paragraph (3) of subdivision g of section 6-134 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 37 for the year 2012, is amended to read as follows:\n      (3) In assessing an appropriate remedy, due consideration shall be given to the gravity of the violation, the history of previous violations, the good faith of the covered employer, and the failure to comply with record-keeping, notice, reporting, or other non-wage requirements. The mayor, or the mayor's designee, may conduct an inquiry related to the results of the investigation conducted by the comptroller pursuant to subdivision g of this section, if necessary, in assessing an appropriate remedy. Any civil penalty shall be deposited in the city general fund.\n      � 11. This local law does not apply to city service contracts entered into or renewed prior to the effective date of this local law. This local law shall not be applied in a manner that interferes with contracts or agreements entered into by the city before the effective date of this local law. \n      � 12. This local law takes effect 90 days after it becomes law.\n\n\nMHL\nLS #1014; 12015\n12/14/17 12:06 p.m.\n1\n\n\n",
