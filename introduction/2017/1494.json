  "Summary": "Every year, the Mayor must produce a Citywide Statement of Needs relating to the opening, expansion, reduction, or closing of city facilities. Not every capital investment the City makes in neighborhoods and infrastructure, however, counts as a city facility. This bill would require the Mayor to add an appendix to the Statement of Needs consisting of a list and explanation of proposed capital projects anticipated for the next two fiscal years, which could include things such as property acquisitions and investments in streets, bridges and tunnels. The appendix would not include projects already listed in the Statement of Needs or capital projects relating to fencing vacant lots, filling sunken lots, or acquiring furnishings, machinery, apparatus or equipment.",
