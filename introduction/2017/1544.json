  "Summary": "This bill would establish or increase the price floor for packages of cigarettes, tobacco products, and non-tobacco shisha, and set minimum package sizes for those products that don’t already have one. The cigarette package price would rise from $10.50 to $13 per package, while smokeless tobacco and shisha packages would be set at $8 and $17, respectively. The cigar price floor would be calculated at a rate of $6 plus $1.75 per cigar in a package, except for individually packaged cigars, which would have a minimum price of $8. It would also tax cigars, little cigars, smokeless tobacco, tobacco-containing shisha, and loose tobacco at a rate of 10% of the minimum price, with proceeds going to fund public housing. Retail dealers of cigarettes and e-cigarettes would also be prohibited from delivering cigarettes, tobacco products, and e-cigarettes to consumers under this bill.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Legislative findings. The Council hereby finds that tobacco use is a leading cause of premature, preventable death in the City, killing an estimated 12,000 people in 2014. All tobacco products-including cigars, smokeless tobacco, tobacco containing shisha and others-are inherently dangerous, and contain nicotine, which is addictive. Health impacts associated with tobacco use include cancer, heart disease, lung disease, and other serious adverse health effects. While the prevalence of youth cigarette smoking in the City, 5.8% in 2015, has declined in recent years, a greater proportion of youth are using other tobacco products (OTP) like cigars, waterpipes (hookahs), and smokeless tobacco. Cigar and smokeless tobacco use increased as a proportion of youth tobacco use from 2007 to 2015. In 2015, youth cigarette smoking and cigar smoking were roughly equal at 5.8% and 5.7%, respectively. Hookah smoking and smokeless tobacco use among NYC youth have also increased in recent years. Between 2008 and 2014, the percentage of middle school students in NYC who had ever smoked hookah increased from 2.9% to 8.5%. In 2014, 16.1% of high school students in the City had smoked hookah. Smokeless tobacco use among NYC youth increased from 2.2% in 2007 to 3.1% in 2015.\n      According to the World Health Organization, tobacco taxes are the single most effective way to decrease consumption and encourage tobacco users to quit. Taxation reduces tobacco use by reducing youth initiation, encouraging tobacco users to quit, and reducing consumption among those who do not quit. Minimum prices that increase prices for tobacco products have a comparable impact on tobacco consumption as taxes. Given relatively high levels of taxation on cigarettes at the federal, state, and local levels, OTP is generally less expensive than cigarettes, increasing its attractiveness as a cheaper alternative.\n      The Council hereby declares that the enactment of this law is necessary to reduce the prevalence of OTP use, particularly among youth. The Public Housing Law authorizes the City to impose a tax on OTP of up to 10% of the purchase price, and revenue generated from the tax must support public housing. This law creates a price floor (or minimum price) for specific categories of OTP (including cigars, little cigars, smokeless tobacco, loose tobacco, and shisha) and sets the OTP tax at 10% of the price floor for each OTP category.1 Price floors provide a mechanism for making the OTP tax consistent for each product category, thereby facilitating the administration of the tax. Price floors also elevate prices on low-priced tobacco products, further advancing this law's public health goals. This tax will improve public health and simultaneously provide a source of revenue for the New York City Housing Authority.\n      � 2.

To request information from the state tax commission [or of], the treasury department of the United States or [of] the taxing officials of any other state or city [which] that imposes a similar [cigarette] tax to any tax imposed by this chapter, and to afford information to such commission, department or other [state or city] taxing official, any other provision of this chapter to the contrary notwithstanding;\n       � 7. Section 11-1310 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by chapter 808 of the laws of 1992, is amended to read as follows:\n      � 11-1310 Determination of tax. If any person fails to pay the tax, or to file a return required by this chapter, or if a return, when filed, is insufficient and the maker fails to file a corrected or sufficient return within ten days after the same may be required by notice from the commissioner of finance, [he or she] the commissioner of finance shall determine the amount of tax due from such information as may be obtainable or on the basis of external indices, such as number of cigarettes purchased or sold, number of tobacco products purchased or sold, stock on hand, volume of sales by similar dealers and/or other factors. Notice of such determination shall be given to the person liable for the payment of the tax. Such determination shall finally and irrevocably fix the tax unless the person against whom it is assessed shall, within ninety days of the giving of such notice, or, if the commissioner of finance has established a conciliation procedure pursuant to section 11-124 of the code and the person liable for the tax has requested a conciliation conference in accordance therewith, within ninety days from the mailing of a conciliation decision or the date of the commissioner's confirmation of the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding, both (1) serves a petition upon the commissioner of finance and (2) files a petition with the tax appeals tribunal for a hearing, or unless the commissioner of finance shall of his or her own motion redetermine such tax.

In addition, whenever any cigarettes upon which stamps have been affixed have been sold and shipped to a dealer outside the city for sale there or to any person in another state for use there, or have become unfit for use and consumption or unsalable, or have been destroyed, the dealer shall be entitled to a refund of the amount of tax paid, less the applicable commission, with respect to such cigarettes. In any event no refund shall be granted unless application to the commissioner of finance therefor is made within two years after the stamps were affixed to such cigarettes or the tax was paid, except if a person has consented in writing to an extension of the period for assessment of additional tax pursuant to subdivision c of section 11-1315 [of this chapter], and such consent is given within the two-year period for making a refund application provided in this subdivision, the period for making a refund application shall not expire prior to six months after the expiration of the period within which an assessment could be made pursuant to such consent or any extension thereof. Whenever a refund is made or denied by the commissioner of finance, the commissioner shall state his or her reasons therefor and give notice thereof to the applicant in writing. A person shall not be entitled to a hearing in connection with such application for a refund if such person has already had a hearing or had been given the opportunity of a hearing as provided in section 11-1310 [of this chapter] or has failed to avail himself or herself of the remedies therein provided. No refund shall be made of a tax, interest or penalty paid pursuant to a determination of the commissioner of finance as provided in section 11-1310 [of this chapter], unless the tax appeals tribunal, after a hearing as in said section provided or the commissioner of finance, of his or her own motion, shall have reduced the tax or penalty, or it shall have been established in a proceeding, pursuant to article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules that such determination was erroneous, illegal, unconstitutional or otherwise improper, in which event a refund without interest shall be made as provided upon the determination of such proceeding. Any determination of the commissioner of finance denying a refund pursuant to this subdivision shall be final and irrevocable unless the applicant for such refund, within ninety days from the mailing of notice of such determination, or, if the commissioner of finance has established a conciliation procedure pursuant to section 11-124 [of this title] and the applicant has requested a conciliation conference in accordance therewith, within ninety days from the mailing of a conciliation decision or the date of the commissioner's confirmation of the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding, both (1) serves a petition upon the commissioner of finance and (2) files a petition with the tax appeals tribunal for a hearing.

Such hearing and any appeal to the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc from the decision rendered in such hearing shall be conducted in the manner and subject to the requirements prescribed by the tax appeals tribunal pursuant to sections one hundred sixty-eight through one hundred seventy-two of the charter. After such hearing, the tax appeals tribunal shall give notice of its decision to the applicant and to the commissioner of finance. The applicant shall be entitled to maintain a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules to review a decision of the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc, provided, however, that such proceeding is instituted within four months after such decision, provided however, that if such decision regards the tax imposed under section 11-1302.1, such proceeding must be instituted within thirty days after such decision, and provided, further, in the case of an application by a person liable for the tax, that a final determination of tax due was not previously made, and that an undertaking shall first be filed by such person with the commissioner of finance in such amount and with such sureties as a justice of the supreme court shall approve, to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed such person will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding.\n       b. If the commissioner of finance is satisfied that any dealer is entitled to a refund the commissioner shall issue to such dealer stamps of sufficient value to cover the refund or to make such refund.\n      � 9. Subdivision b of section 11-1314 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\n      b. In addition to all other remedies for the collection of any taxes, penalties or interest due under the provisions of this chapter, the commissioner of finance may with respect to any tax imposed under section 11-1302 or any penalties or interest related thereto issue a warrant, directed to the city sheriff commanding the sheriff to levy upon and sell the real and personal property of the person liable for the tax which may be found within the city, for the payment of the amount thereof, with any penalties and interest and the cost of executing the warrant, and to return such warrant to the commissioner of finance and to pay to the commissioner the money collected by virtue thereof within sixty days after the receipt of such warrant. The city sheriff shall within five days after the receipt of the warrant file with the county clerk a copy thereof, and thereupon such clerk shall enter in the judgment docket the name of the person mentioned in the warrant and the amount of the taxes, penalty and interest for which the warrant is issued and the date when such copy is filed. Thereupon the amount of such warrant shall become a lien upon the title to and interest in real and personal property of the person against whom the warrant is issued. The city sheriff shall then proceed upon the warrant in the same manner and with like effect as that provided by law in respect to executions issued against property upon judgments of a court of record, and for services in executing the warrant the city sheriff shall be entitled to the same fees which he or she may collect in the same manner. In the discretion of the commissioner of finance a warrant of like terms, force and effect may be issued and directed to any officer or employee of the department of finance, and in the execution thereof such officer or employee shall have all the powers conferred by law upon sheriffs, but shall be entitled to no fee or compensation in excess of the actual expenses paid in the performance of such duty. If a warrant is returned not satisfied in full, the commissioner of finance may from time to time issue new warrants and shall have the same remedies to enforce the amount due thereunder as if the city had recovered judgment therefor and execution thereon had been returned unsatisfied.\n      � 10. Subdivision a of section 11-1317 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\n      a.

Legislative findings. The Council hereby finds \\cf1 that \\cf2 tobacco use \\cf1 is a \\cf0 leading cause of premature, preventable death in the City, killing an estimated 12,000 people in 2014. All tobacco products-including cigars, smokeless tobacco, tobacco containing shisha and others-are inherently dangerous, and contain nicotine, which is addictive. Health impacts associated with tobacco use include cancer, heart disease, lung disease, and other serious adverse health effects.\\super  \\nosupersub While the prevalence of youth cigarette smoking in the City, 5.8% in 2015, has declined in recent years, a greater proportion of youth are using other tobacco products (OTP) like cigars, waterpipes (hookahs), and smokeless tobacco. Cigar and smokeless tobacco use increased as a proportion of youth tobacco use from 2007 to 2015. In 2015, youth cigarette smoking and cigar smoking were roughly equal at 5.8% and 5.7%, respectively. Hookah smoking and smokeless tobacco use among NYC youth have also increased in recent years. Between 2008 and 2014, the percentage of middle school students in NYC who had ever smoked hookah increased from 2.9% to 8.5%. In 2014, 16.1% of high school students in the City had smoked hookah.\\super  \\nosupersub Smokeless tobacco use among NYC youth increased from 2.2% in 2007 to 3.1% in 2015.\\par\nAccording to the World Health Organization, tobacco taxes are the single most effective way to decrease consumption and encourage tobacco users to quit\\cf2 .\\cf0  \\cf2 Taxation reduces tobacco use by reducing youth initiation, encouraging tobacco users to quit, and reducing consumption among those who do not quit. Minimum prices that increase prices for tobacco products have a comparable impact on tobacco consumption as taxes. Given relatively high levels of taxation on cigarettes at the \\cf0 federal, state, and local levels\\cf2 , \\cf0 OTP is generally less expensive than cigarettes, increasing its attractiveness as a cheaper alternative.\\par\nThe Council hereby declares that the enactment of this law is necessary to reduce the prevalence of OTP use, particularly among youth. The Public Housing Law authorizes the City to impose a tax on OTP of up to 10% of the purchase price, and revenue generated from the tax must support public housing. This law creates a price floor (or minimum price) for specific categories of OTP (including cigars, little cigars, smokeless tobacco, loose tobacco, and shisha) and sets the OTP tax at 10% of the price floor for each OTP category. Price floors provide a mechanism for making the OTP tax consistent for each product category, thereby facilitating the administration of the tax. Price floors also elevate prices on low-priced tobacco products, further advancing this law\\rquote s public health goals. This tax will improve public health and simultaneously provide a source of revenue for the New York City Housing Authority.\\par\n\\pard\\ltrpar\\hyphpar0\\fi720\\sl480\\slmult1\\qj\\'a7 2.
