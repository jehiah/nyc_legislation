  "Summary": "This bill would amend the administrative code by requiring the Department of Buildings (“DOB”) commissioner to establish and implement an education and outreach program to increase awareness of the existing requirement that single-occupant toilet rooms be available for use by persons of any gender, as well as the related posting and signage requirements for such toilet rooms. Such program must include, at a minimum: (1) educational materials available to owners required to comply with the requirements and on DOB’s website in English and the six languages most commonly spoken by limited English proficient individuals in the City; and (2) linguistically and culturally competent outreach tailored to such owners. The DOB commissioner must seek the cooperation of certain other City agencies. The commissioner would also be required to submit to the Mayor and Speaker of the Council, and post on DOB’s website, an annual report on the implementation and efficacy of the program.",
