Collectively, these sites have not been linked through unifying signage, programs or maps by the City into a cohesive walkable tour, akin to Boston’s Freedom Trail. This bill would establish a task force to consider the creation of a Freedom Trail in the City. The task force would consist of public officials and appointed representatives from relevant organizations. The task force would be required to meet at least quarterly and hold at least two public meetings. The task force would be required to submit a report of its recommendations to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council no later than 12 months after the final member is appointed.","TextID":59958,"Text":"Int.
