The commission members shall elect from among the membership a chairperson and vice chairperson.\n      c.

No person shall be disqualified to serve as a commission member by reason of holding any other public office or employment, nor shall they forfeit any such office or employment by reason of their appointment hereunder, notwithstanding the provisions of any law.\n      e. Any vacancy in the membership of the commission or of its officers shall be filled by appointment made by the appointing authority of the original appointee creating the vacancy. A vacancy in the commission shall not impair the right of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the commission and eight members thereof shall constitute a quorum.\n      f. Commission members shall receive no compensation for their services, but shall be reimbursed for the actual and necessary expenses incurred by them in the performance of their duties.\n      g. The terms of office of the commission members shall expire on the day of the election at which the proposed new or revised charter prepared by the commission is submitted to the qualified electors of the city, or on the day of the second general election following the date of the enactment of this local law if no such questions have been submitted by that time.\n      � 3. Commission mandate and powers. a. The commission shall review the entire charter and prepare a draft of a proposed new or revised charter. \n      b.

The commission shall also have power to conduct private hearings, take testimony, subpoena witnesses, and require the production of books, papers, and records. On request of the commission, the mayor may direct any board, body, officer or employee of the city to cooperate with, assist, advise, provide facilities, materials or data, and render services to the commission. \n      � 4.

The commission may require that its proposed charter be submitted in two or more parts so arranged that corresponding parts of the existing charter shall remain in effect if one or more of such parts are not adopted, or may in lieu of a new charter submit a revision of the existing charter in one or more amendments and may also submit alternative charters or amendments or alternative provisions to supersede designated portions of a proposed charter or amendment if adopted. \n      b. The commission is authorized to submit its proposed new or revised charter to the electors of the city at a general or special election, and shall complete and file in the office of the city clerk its proposed new or revised charter in time for submission to the electors not later than the second general election after the date of the enactment of this local law.\n      � 5. Severability.  If any provision of this local law, or any amendments thereto, shall be held invalid or ineffective in whole or in part, or inapplicable to any person or situation, such holding shall not affect, impair or invalidate any portion of or the remainder of this local law, and all other provisions thereof shall nevertheless be separately and fully effective and the application of any such provision to other persons or situation shall not be affected.\n      � 6.
