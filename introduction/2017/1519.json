The bill also requires the Department of Social Services, in coordination with the Department for the Aging, to establish and implement a SNAP enrollment and recertification program.  The program must ensure that SNAP enrollment and recertification programming is taking place at all senior centers in the City.  In addition, the bill requires the Department of Social Services to provide an annual report to the Council on the department’s public campaign and SNAP enrollment and recertification activity for seniors as well as provide the Council with data on senior SNAP enrollment and recertification.","TextID":59974,"Text":"Int.
