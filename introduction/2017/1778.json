No. 1778\n \nBy Council Members Williams and Rodriguez\n \n..Title\nA Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to term limits for council members\n..Body\n \nBe it enacted by the Council as follows:\n       \n      Section 1. Section 1137 of the New York city charter is amended to read as follows:\n      � 1137  Public policy. It is hereby declared to be the public policy of the city of New York to limit the time elected officials can serve as mayor, public advocate, comptroller, borough president and council member so that there is more opportunity for citizen participation in the legislative and executive branches and the airing of a greater diversity of ideas. It is further declared that this policy is most appropriately served by limiting the time such officials can serve to not more than two consecutive full terms for the offices of mayor, public advocate, comptroller,  and borough president and three consecutive full terms for the office of council member. It is further declared that public confidence in government should be protected by restricting amendments that would affect the application of term limits to any elected official then in office.\n      � 2. Subdivision a of section 1138 of the New York city charter is amended to read as follows:\n      a. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this charter, no person shall be eligible to be elected to or serve in the office of mayor, public advocate, comptroller, or borough president [or council member] if that person had previously held such office for two or more consecutive full terms, or to the office of council member if that person had previously held such office for three consecutive full terms, unless one full term or more has elapsed since that person last held such office.\n      � 3. This local law takes effect 90 days following its ratification by the voters of New York city in a referendum to be held in the general election next following its enactment.\n \nBJR\nLS #4075\n11/01/17  2:16PM\n\n",
