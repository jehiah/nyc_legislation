  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to create standards for how water testing for lead is required to be conducted for child care centers. It would also codify the requirement, contained in the Health Code, that this testing occur every five years, and require that the testing be of a first drawn sample of water.",
