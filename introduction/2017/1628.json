  "Summary": "This bill would require all persons seeking to offer a quality improvement course related to the operation of a for-hire vehicle to seek authorization from the Taxi and Limousine Commission. In order to ensure that these courses reflect the required level of quality, transparency and safety expected by the public in the operation of for-hire vehicles, this bill would require the Taxi and Limousine Commission to set rules and regulations relating to the standards of operation of the quality improvement courses, including the content of course curricula, methods of evaluation of course content, and course fees.",
