  "Summary": "This bill would require the office of the language services coordinator to designate neighborhood tabulation areas where 37 percent or more of residents are limited English proficient (LEP) as Priority Language Access Service Areas, and to monitor and report on the provision of simultaneous language services by city agencies in such areas. The bill requires city agencies conducting public presentations in or targeting residents of such areas to translate advertising for the presentation and to provide simultaneous language services at the presentation in the top non-English language. If the second most commonly spoken language is represented by ten or more percent of LEP residents of such area, then the city agency, resources permitting, shall seek to make the public presentation accessible in that language as well.  Finally, resources permitting, the bill members of the public would be able to request simultaneous language services in languages other than those being provided.",
