  "Summary": "The bill would require City employees and contractors to protect identifying information—such as contact information, sexual orientation, religion, and immigration status—by limiting its collection, disclosure, and retention. A newly-established privacy officer within each agency would review and approve the collection, disclosure, and retention of identifying information to ensure such actions further the purpose or mission of such agency and protect identifying information from unauthorized disclosure.",

Contractors and subcontractors. Each city agency shall require contractors that obtain identifying information, whether directly or through subcontractors, to apply the requirements of subdivisions b, c, d, and e of this section and any applicable policies and protocols adopted pursuant to this chapter; provided, however, that the duties of the privacy officer may be exercised by such contractors and subcontractors by designation of the agency.\n      h.
