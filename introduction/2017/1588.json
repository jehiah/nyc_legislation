  "Summary": "The bill would require City employees and contractors to protect identifying information—such as contact information, sexual orientation, religion, and immigration status—by limiting its collection, disclosure, and retention. A newly-established privacy officer within each agency would review and approve the collection, disclosure, and retention of identifying information to ensure such actions further the purpose or mission of such agency and protect identifying information from unauthorized disclosure.",
