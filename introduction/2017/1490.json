First, for every category of facility described in the criteria for siting city facilities often called the “Fair Share criteria” (such as community health facilities, solid waste transfer facilities, and residential care facilities), the Statement would rank each community district by how concentrated it is with such facilities, in terms of the ratio of facility capacity the community district’s population (or to the population of the relevant subgroups). Second, for every facility listed in the Statement, the Statement would list the use code used by the Department of Citywide Administrative Services and would include a similar ranked index of community districts for each relevant use code.","TextID":57242,"Text":"Int.
