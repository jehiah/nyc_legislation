This bill would require the Administration for Children’s Services (ACS) to provide training to all individuals providing preventive services on an ongoing basis. The bill would also require ACS to ensure that all individuals providing preventive services to attend at least one training a year, the content of which ACS determines.","TextID":60693,"Text":"Int.
