  "Summary": "Preventive services are supportive services provided to children and their families for the purposes of averting an impairment or disruption of a family which will or could result in the placement of a child in foster care, enabling a child who has been placed in foster care to return to his family at an earlier time than would otherwise be possible, or reducing the likelihood that a child who has been discharged from foster care would return to care. This bill would require the Administration for Children’s Services (ACS) to provide training to all individuals providing preventive services on an ongoing basis. The bill would also require ACS to ensure that all individuals providing preventive services to attend at least one training a year, the content of which ACS determines.",
