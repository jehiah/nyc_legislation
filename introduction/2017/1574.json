  "Summary": "There are roughly 3.5 million private-sector workers in New York City, a significant percentage of whom have no access to retirement savings whatsoever. This bill would establish an individual retirement account (IRA) program for private-sector workers at businesses with 10 or more employees located in New York City that do not already offer retirement savings plans. Enrollment in the program is automatic, but employees may opt out. Contributions are handled through payroll deductions and set at a default rate, but employees may change their contribution rate. Savings accounts would be comprised of individual employees’ savings only; neither employers nor the City would contribute to individual accounts. Covered employers would be required to distribute program information to employees. The bill also sets forth a complaint procedure and civil penalties for violations.",

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the board promulgates rules in accordance with subdivision h of section 20-942, a covered employer shall remit funds in accordance with such rules.  \n      c. A covered employer shall not be permitted to endorse or contribute to the program.\n      d.

The retirement savings board may delay implementation of the employer obligation required by subdivision a of this section for covered employers, provided that such delay shall not exceed three years from the initial enrollment of eligible employees, and provided further, that such delay shall be based on the practicability of implementation using the following criteria:\n      1. the number of eligible employees;\n      2. the size of the covered employer; or\n      3. the sector or industry of the covered employer.\n      � 20-948 Covered employer record retention. Each covered employer shall retain annual records documenting such employer's compliance with the requirements of this chapter for a period of three years, unless otherwise required pursuant to any other law, rule or regulation, and shall allow the agency or agencies designated by the mayor pursuant to section 20-938 to access such records upon request.

After notice and an opportunity to be heard, a covered employer who violates subdivision a or b of section 20-944 is liable for a civil penalty of $250 per violation. \n      d. Each failure to comply with subdivision a or b of section 20-944 with respect to each eligible employee of a covered employer constitutes a separate violation. Where failure to comply with subdivision a or b of section 20-944 is ongoing, each two-week period of noncompliance constitutes a separate violation with respect to each affected eligible employee, except that a covered employer shall not be held liable for more than 26 weeks' worth of violations unless the prosecuting agency demonstrates that the covered employer had actual notice of the requirements of this chapter.\n      e. In addition to the penalties provided by subdivision c of this section, after notice and an opportunity to be heard a covered employer that violates section 20-948 by failing to retain annual records is liable for a civil penalty of $100 for each employee for which such covered employer has failed to retain annual records. A covered employer that violates section 20-948 by preventing the agency or agencies designated by the mayor pursuant to section 20-938 to access records for which access is required under section 20-948 is liable for a civil penalty of $1,000 for each such violation.\n      f. The agency or agencies designated by the mayor pursuant to subdivision j of section 20-938 may commence a proceeding to recover any civil penalty authorized by subdivision c or e of this section by filing a petition returnable to the office of administrative trials and hearings, which may impose the civil penalties prescribed by subdivisions c and e of this section. Such civil penalties may, in the alternative, be recovered in a civil action brought by the corporation counsel in a court of competent jurisdiction.\n      g. The corporation counsel may bring an action on behalf of the city to restrain or prevent any violation of this chapter or a continuation of any such violation. \n      h. Pursuant to a written request by an eligible employee, the corporation counsel may also bring an action on behalf of any eligible employee where such employee's covered employer has failed to enroll such employee or has failed to remit such employee's contributions in accordance with subdivision a or b of section 20-944 to obtain any appropriate legal or equitable relief on behalf of such eligible employee in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter. \n      i. An eligible employee who has not made a request of the corporation counsel pursuant to subdivision h or who has made such a request upon which the corporation counsel has not acted after 90 days from receipt of such request or upon which the corporation counsel has declined to act, may bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction for violation of subdivision a or b of section 20-944 to obtain any appropriate legal or equitable relief in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter.\n      � 2.
