  "Summary": "This proposed law will require reporting regarding PCB remediation in city schools. Caulking (primarily in window and door frames), soil, and HVAC systems in city schools have been recognized as sources of PCBs that require remediation. This law would keep the public informed regarding remediation efforts regarding these sources to make sure that the Department of Education is following EPA guidelines.",
