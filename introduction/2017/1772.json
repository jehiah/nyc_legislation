  "Summary": "This legislation would require individuals or businesses that rent or lease trailers to obtain a parking permit in order to park a rental trailer on a commercial or residential street. The bill also limits the number of rental trailers that may be parked on a commercial or residential street to one per street. An application for such a parking permit must be submitted to the Department of Transportation, as well as a fee proportional to the size of the trailer and the duration of the permit. The parking permit is valid for a maximum for 30 days. Penalties for violating the law or misusing a permit are also set forth.",
