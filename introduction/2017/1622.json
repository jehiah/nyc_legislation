Under this law, the report would be issued quarterly (rather than annually), be issued by the City Law Department (instead of the Mayor) and include additional information regarding workplace injuries and illnesses. The report, currently sent to the Comptroller, Public Advocate and Speaker of the Council, would also be distributed to every Council Member.","TextID":59196,"Text":"Int.
