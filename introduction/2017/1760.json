  "Summary": "This proposed law would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to test for lead in the soil of public parks located near high-traffic roads and bridges. Research suggests that such locations may have a higher concentration of certain heavy metals, with road traffic as the source. The Department of Parks and Recreation would then remediate the lead-contaminated soil after notification by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.",
