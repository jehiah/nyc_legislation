  "Summary": "The local law amends Title 24 of the New York City Administrative Code, adding a new section (h) to 24-163 to prohibit idling for more than one minute adjacent to a plainly identified senior citizen center, effective immediately.  The bill provides exemptions for when a vehicle is used  to operate a loading, unloading or processing device, for  mechanical  work when required, to  maintain  an  appropriate  temperature   for  passenger  comfort  or  in emergency evacuations where necessary to  operate wheelchair lifts.",
