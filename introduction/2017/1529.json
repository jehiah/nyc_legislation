  "Summary": "This bill would require that the Department of Homeless Services (DHS) report to the Council and post on its website information about its plans to phase-out the existing stock of cluster site shelters. The bill would require DHS to report on how it plans to close cluster sites, or convert those units into permanent housing for homeless families or stand-alone shelter, and would require DHS to take into consideration certain metrics when developing that plan. The bill would require quarterly reports on all buildings containing cluster sites, including DHS’ goal for how it will phase out all cluster sites, and when those goals are achieved. The bill would also require DHS to report information within 10 days to the Council if it ever enters into a new contract or agreement for a cluster site.",
