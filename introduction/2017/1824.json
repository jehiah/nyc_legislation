  "Summary": "This bill would create an interagency task force to study the City’s existing system of removing from public streets vehicles that have been abandoned or parked without license plates or proper registration. Residents have complained that such vehicles take up parking spaces in their neighborhoods and are not removed in a timely manner, if at all. The task force would collect information about the effectiveness of current practices and evaluate potential solutions to this problem in a final report.",
