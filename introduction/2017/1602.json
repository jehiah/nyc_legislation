  "Summary": "The proposed local law would amend § 19-101 by reorganizing the definitions to conform to alphabetical order, and it would also add a new definition for “muni-meter” to the section. The proposed legislation would also permit free parking at muni-meters for owners of electric vehicles. This benefit would be limited to one day a week, on Saturdays.",
