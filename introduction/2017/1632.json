In 2020 and in each calendar year thereafter, an owner of a covered building shall use the benchmarking tool to provide an energy efficiency score for such building to the department in accordance with the rules of the department unless, in accordance with such rules, the building is a type of building for which it is not feasible to obtain an energy efficiency score. In each such year, the department shall issue an energy efficiency grade to the owner in accordance with such rules. \n\n� 28-309.12.3 Display of energy efficiency score and energy efficiency grade. Within 30 days after the owner of a covered building obtains an energy efficiency grade, such owner shall post such grade and the energy efficiency score upon which such grade was based in a conspicuous location near each public entrance to such building, in a form and manner established by the department.  \n\nException: This section 28-309.12.3 shall not apply to posting of the energy efficiency score of a building with an energy efficiency grade of N. \n\n� 28-309.12.4 Publication of energy efficiency grades and energy efficiency scores. For each building for which an energy efficiency grade or energy efficiency score is generated pursuant to this section, the department shall make information generated in connection with such grade and score publicly available online by no later than May 1 of the year following such generation.\n\nException: This section 28-309.12.4 shall not apply to information generated with respect to a building with an energy efficiency grade of N.\n\n� 28-309.12.5 Audits. The department shall, from time to time, audit information submitted for buildings in connection with energy efficiency grades and energy efficiency scores. Such audits shall occur at least annually and shall involve appropriate sample size of buildings, as determined by the department.\n\n      � 4. a. On or before December 31, 2021, an agency designated by the mayor shall electronically submit to the mayor and the speaker of the council a report on the value of the energy asset score in predicting energy performance for buildings, including recommendations as to whether and in what form and manner such scores should be disclosed.\n      b. As used in this section:\n      Agency. The term \"agency\" means an agency, as defined in section 1-112 of the administrative code of the city of New York, the head of which is appointed by the mayor or by a person appointed by the mayor.\n      Energy asset score. The term \"energy asset score\" means, for a building, a score that evaluates the energy efficiency of such building's envelope and mechanical and electrical systems.\n      � 5.
