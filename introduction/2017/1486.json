  "Summary": "The proposed legislation would require the Department of Education (DOE) to issue reports on the number of individuals who applied for, received offers for, and enrolled in pre-kindergarten, kindergarten, sixth and ninth grade in DOE schools. The information would be reported by community school district and by individual school.  The information would be disaggregated by grade level, community school district of residence of individuals, primary home language of individuals, and zip code of individuals.  The bill would also require DOE to report on anticipated seats available at each school in the following school year.",
