  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Finance to exempt grocery stores from the commercial rent tax if they meet certain floor space and affordability requirements. The purpose of this bill is to help prevent affordable grocery stores from closing due to the increased cost of commercial rents. It also promotes healthier grocery store retail practices by requiring that a minimum of 500 square feet of floor space be devoted exclusively to the sale of fresh produce.",
