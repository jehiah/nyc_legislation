  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Homeless Services (DHS) to provide any medically frail homeless single adult with medically appropriate shelter. Medically appropriate shelters would allow individuals to have access to their beds at all times, have on-site medical support staff and provide for 24-hour on call medical staff when such support staff are not on-site, allow residents to easily access their medications, and be fully accessible for individuals who have mobility impairments or other disabilities.",
