  "Summary": "Federal law requires sufficient vessel waste pumpout facilities for a body of water to be designated a no-discharge zone for water protection purposes. This bill would require the Department of Environmental Protection to create a plan for establishing the city’s coastal waters as vessel no-discharge zones, to install at least three pumpout facilities per year until all coastal waters in the city are designated as no-discharge zones, to report annually on progress regarding the foregoing, and to ensure that no-discharge zones maintain their status as no-discharge zones once they are established.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Section 22-112 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new subdivision f to read as follows:\n      f. 1. Definitions. For purposes of this subdivision, the term \"pumpout facility\" has the meaning ascribed to such term in the environmental conservation law. \n      2. Plan to establish no-discharge zones. (a) No later than March 1, 2017, the department of environmental protection shall create a written plan to establish all of the city's coastal waters as no-discharge zones. \n       (b) The plan shall consider the existing number and locations of pumpout facilities in or adjacent to the city's coastal waters, and determine the number of additional pumpout facilities required to establish a no-discharge zone in each coastal body of water in the city, and the necessary locations of such additional pumpout facilities.  \n      3. Every calendar year until all of the city's coastal waters are designated as no-discharge zones, the department of environmental protection shall install at least three public pumpout facilities. The department of environmental protection shall prioritize installing pumpout facilities in or around the bodies of water with the lowest number of necessary additional pumpout facilities required to establish them as no-discharge zones, as identified pursuant to subparagraph (b) of paragraph 2 of this subdivision.\n      4. By March 1 of every year until all of the city's coastal waters are designated as no-discharge zones, the department of environmental protection shall update the plan created pursuant to paragraph 2 of this subdivision and report to the mayor and the council on the pumpout facilities installed in the 12 months preceding the report, the pumpout facilities to be installed in the 12 months following the report, an assessment of priorities pursuant to paragraph 3 of this subdivision and an assessment of progress toward establishing all of the city's coastal waters as no-discharge zones.\n      5. The department of environmental protection shall ensure that all no-discharge zones continue to meet federal eligibility criteria for no-discharge zones promulgated pursuant to the clean water act. \n      � 2.
