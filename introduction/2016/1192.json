  "Summary": "This bill would require an interagency task force to develop and submit to the Mayor and the Speaker recommendations for improving services for youth in foster care and outcomes for youth aging out of foster care. The task force would include representatives of ACS, DSS, DOE, DYCD, DOMHM, NYCHA, the City Council, the Public Advocate, foster care providers, advocacy organizations, and youth who are in foster care and youth who have recently aged out of foster care, and a parent with child welfare experience. The task force would submit recommendations regarding education, housing, financial literacy, health and mental health services, parenting, decreasing the number of youth who age out of foster care, and prioritizing permanent placements of youth with families before they age out. The task force would submit follow-up reports regarding implementation of the recommendations one and two years after the submissions of the initial report, and would then cease to exist.",
