  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation (DOT) to prepare a report by August 1, 2017 regarding the feasibility of implementing Barnes dance pedestrian interval crossing systems at high-crash intersections. A Barnes dance uses pedestrian control signals to allow pedestrians to completely cross an intersection in any direction, including diagonally, while traffic is stopped in all directions. The report would also examine other types of crossings that allow pedestrians to cross while traffic is stopped in all directions and would include an update to DOT’s August 2016 left turn pedestrian and bicyclist crash study.",

As used in this local law, the following terms have the following meanings:\n      Department. The term \"department\" means the department of transportation.\n      Barnes dance pedestrian interval crossing system. The term \"Barnes dance pedestrian interval crossing system\" means a system of utilizing pedestrian control signals that allows pedestrians an exclusive interval in which to completely cross in any direction, including diagonally, within the intersection while traffic is stopped in all directions.\n      Exclusive pedestrian phase.  The term \"exclusive pedestrian phase\" means a signal phase that allows pedestrians to completely cross any marked crossing of an intersection or street crossing while traffic is stopped in all directions.\n      Mid-block crossing. The term \"Mid-block crossing\" means a marked pedestrian crossing of a street at a location between intersections.\n      One-way-away T intersection. The term \"One-way-away T intersection\" means an intersection with three legs in a T configuration at which the street that ends in the intersection is a one-way street traveling away from such intersection.\n      � 2. The department shall prepare a report regarding the feasibility of implementing Barnes dance pedestrian interval crossing systems at high-crash intersections. Such report shall include locations of signalized intersections or signalized street crossings utilizing an exclusive pedestrian phase, disaggregated by type of intersection or street crossing, such as a mid-block crossing or one-way-away T intersection. Such report shall also include an update on implementation of the action plan included in the left turn pedestrian and bicyclist crash study entitled \"Don't Cut Corners,\" published by the department in August 2016 and prepared pursuant to local law 21 for the year 2014. The department shall post on its website and submit to the mayor and the speaker of the city council such report no later than August 1, 2017. \n      � 3.
