  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation (DOT) to prepare a report by August 1, 2017 regarding the feasibility of implementing Barnes dance pedestrian interval crossing systems at high-crash intersections. A Barnes dance uses pedestrian control signals to allow pedestrians to completely cross an intersection in any direction, including diagonally, while traffic is stopped in all directions. The report would also examine other types of crossings that allow pedestrians to cross while traffic is stopped in all directions and would include an update to DOT’s August 2016 left turn pedestrian and bicyclist crash study.",
