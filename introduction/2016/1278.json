  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department for the Aging (DFTA) to create an online public searchable database of all social adult day cares (SADCs) registered with the department.  If applicable, the database would also indicate the number of notices of violation issued to the SADC and the outcome of any adjudication conducted pursuant to subdivision c of Section 21-204.  The year and nature of the notice of violation and the adjudication would be posted, but cannot contain personally identifying information about a complainant.  The bill would also allow an individual to electronically submit complaints about an SADC to the SADC ombudsperson through the database.",
