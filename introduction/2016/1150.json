  "TextID": 58139,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n      Section 1. Chapter 1 of the New York city charter is amended by adding a new section 13-c to read as follows:\n      � 13-c. Municipal division of transitional services. a. The mayor shall establish a municipal division of transitional services. Such division may, but need not, be established in the executive office of the mayor or as a separate division or within any other office of the mayor, or within any department the head of which is appointed by the mayor. Such division shall be headed by a coordinator who shall be appointed by the mayor or the head of such department. For the purposes of this section, \"coordinator\" shall mean the coordinator of the municipal division of transitional services. \n      b. Powers and duties. The division shall have the power and the duty to: \n      1. ensure, by such means as necessary, including coordination with relevant city agencies, the availability of effective reentry services to individuals residing in New York city who have been released from the custody of the New York city department of correction after having served a period of criminal incarceration or criminal detention and other individuals in need of reentry services that have served a period of criminal incarceration or criminal detention;\n      2. create a coordinated system for the administration of reentry services. Such system  shall ensure access to reentry services in areas where a substantial number of such individuals reside. To the extent that the coordinator deems appropriate, such system may also include integration and coordination with similar services provided by other city agencies, and existing facilities operated by city agencies may be utilized for the purpose of such integration and coordination;\n      3. administer contracts for the provision of reentry services as appropriate, and to the extent required by paragraph 1 of this subdivision, review the budget requests of all agencies for programs related to reentry services, and recommend to the mayor budget priorities among such services and assist the mayor in prioritizing such requests;\n      4. provide outreach and education on the availability of reentry services; and\n      5. perform other duties as the mayor may assign.\n      c. Annual progress report.  By October 31, 2017, and by October 31 of every year thereafter, the coordinator shall prepare and submit to the mayor and council a report of the activities of the division and its progress in ensuring the delivery of effective reentry services.
