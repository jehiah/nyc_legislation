  "Summary": "This bill would incrementally increase the annual base fee of a dog license from its current price of $8.50 to $15.00 as of January 1, 2017, $20.00 beginning on January 1, 2018 and $25.00 beginning on January 1, 2019. It would waive the first year’s base fee for any dog adopted from an animal shelter operated on behalf the City.   The bill would impose an additional fee of $25.50 for unsterilized dogs.  Owners would be required to certify with the license application that the dog has been sterilized, or provide documentation from a licensed veterinarian that the dog was sterile or medically unfit to be sterilized. The Department of Health and Mental Hygiene would be authorized to charge a late free for renewal of an expired license.  That fee would be $1.00 until December 31, 2016 after which time it would increase to $2.00.  The Department would be authorized to issue specialty tags for an additional fee of $25.00 plus costs.  The replacement fee for a lost or destroyed dog license would be set at $7.50.",
