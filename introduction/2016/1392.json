Variances and special permits. a. The applicant, the property owner, and the preparer of any document accompanying an application to vary the zoning resolution or an application for a special permit shall certify, executed under penalty of perjury, that the statements made in the application and accompanying documents are correct. Such certifications shall be notarized. \n      b. The board shall establish by rule the minimum required materials, including but not limited to financial analysis, to be submitted with an application for a variance from the zoning resolution, provided that this requirement shall not limit the board's ability to require additional materials from an applicant, and further provided that such application shall include the following:\n\t1. In addition to any materials submitted in support of a claim of uniqueness of physical conditions, a neighborhood character study defined by a radius appropriate to the scale of the neighborhood, as determined by the board, shall be provided. Such study shall include data relevant to the waivers being sought, photographs and relevant land use approvals, for the entire study area.\n      2.

Each such community board shall, not later than sixty days after the receipt of the proposal or application, either notify the public of the proposal or application, in the manner specified by the city planning commission pursuant to subdivision i of section one hundred ninety-seven-c, conduct a public hearing thereon and prepare and submit a written recommendation thereon directly to the board of standards and appeals, or waive the conduct of such public hearing and the preparation of such written recommendation. If a public hearing is held, the applicant shall submit to the board of standards and appeals a copy of any presentation materials utilized at the hearing, as well as a notarized statement executed under penalty of perjury that such materials are true and correct and are as presented to the community board, and such community board may submit to the board of standards and appeals a copy of any testimony presented or materials received from the applicant for such application.\n                     3. A copy of a recommendation or waiver by a community board pursuant to paragraph two of this subdivision that involves land located within two or more community districts in a borough shall also be filed with the borough board within the same time period specified in that paragraph.
