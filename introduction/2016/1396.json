  "Summary": "This bill will make the schedules of fast food employees more predictable. It will create general provisions for a fair work week chapter of the Administrative Code and will require certain fast food employers to provide employees with an estimate of their work schedule upon hire and a work schedule 14 days in advance (including all shifts). This bill will require a premium to be paid to employees for schedule changes made by the employer with less than 14 days’ notice to the employee (a greater schedule change premium is as the start of the first shift nears). Changes to schedules will will canceling, shortening, or moving shifts, adding additional hours to scheduled shifts, and adding shifts. \r\n\r\nThis bill is part of a package of bills aimed at improving working conditions related to employee work schedules. The bill also renumbers, without substantive change, provisions on shipboard gambling to make room for new provisions administered by the Department of Consumer Affairs.",
