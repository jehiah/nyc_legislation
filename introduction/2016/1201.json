  "Summary": "This bill would create an affirmative defense to parking violations issued to motorists who inadvertently park their cars in spots restricted by illegible parking signs. The defense of illegibility would protect motorists from unfair sanctions and possibly also serve as an incentive to replace or repair such illegible parking signs.",
