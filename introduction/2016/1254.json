  "Summary": "The proposed legislation amends administrative code § 3-209.2 to include pre-kindergarteners among the students to whom the Department of Education (DOE) is required to distribute college savings plans materials. The bill additionally requires the DOE to include in such materials information on other resources available to parents and students regarding financial planning for post-secondary education, including college, university, and vocational schools, and requires DOE to make the materials available in multiple languages. The proposed legislation also adds a new section 17-168.1 to the administrative code to require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to distribute college savings plan materials to parents and guardians within three months of a child’s birth, to make such materials available on its website, and to make such materials available in multiple languages.",
