The bill would expand certain age disaggregation reporting and require ACS to report on the total population of youth currently in care by age. The bill would also require ACS to report on the number of youth who enter a homeless shelter within 30 days, 90 days, 180 days and 1 year of aging out of care, the number of youth who receive benefits from the Human Resources Administration within 30 days and 60 days of being discharged form foster care, and the number of youth who age out and transition to Medicaid without a gap in coverage. The bill would make several technical amendments and would also require ACS to make all reports required pursuant to the proposed bill available on its website.","TextID":58494,"Text":"Int.
