  "Summary": "Proposed Int. 1066-A would require the Department of Homeless Services (DHS) to maintain a record of all unsheltered homeless persons who are receiving services from or have been contacted by outreach staff. The record would be updated in real time and contain, to the extent available: first and last name, date of birth, race or ethnicity, and the location where outreach staff engaged the person, including, bus shelter, drop-in center, hospital, park, safe haven or subway. Starting September 1, 2018, and quarterly thereafter, DHS would submit to the Speaker of the Council and post online the total number of unsheltered homeless persons included in the record, broken down to the extent available by the location where outreach staff first engaged the unsheltered homeless person.",
