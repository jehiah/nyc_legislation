This project could be developed by a third-party developer selected through a request-for-proposals (RFP) process. The bill would establish criteria for choosing a site for the pilot district and would require a geothermal system to be constructed and maintained, and require that geothermal energy be provided to participating buildings through power purchase agreements with building owners. These agreements would give ownership of geothermal system infrastructure to building owners at the conclusion of the agreement term, which could not exceed seven years. The bill would also require detailed reporting on various aspects of the pilot program, including recommendations on whether the program should be expanded.","TextID":58027,"Text":"Int. No. 1229\n\nBy Council Members Constantinides, Chin, Mendez, Cornegy, Espinal, Levine and Richards\n\n..Title\nA Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the creation of a pilot program for a district-scale geothermal system\n..Body\n\nBe it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1.
