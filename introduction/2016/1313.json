  "Summary": "This bill would expand Chapter 8 of title 20 of the code, the Earned Sick Time Act, which would be renamed the “Earned Sick and Safe Time Act.” The law would be expanded to allow victims of family offense matters, such as disorderly conduct and harassment, sexual offenses, such as sexual misconduct, forcible touching and sexual abuse, stalking and human trafficking to use earned “safe” hours in connection with such abuse. Such hours would be available for employees to obtain services from a domestic violence shelter or rape crisis center; participate in safety planning, temporarily or permanently relocate; to meet with an attorney or other social service provider to obtain information and advice; or take other actions to ensure their own or a family members’ safety.",

Employees shall determine how much earned [sick] safe/sick time they need to use, provided that employers may set a reasonable minimum increment for the use of [sick] safe/sick time not to exceed four hours per day.\n      h.

Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as requiring financial or other reimbursement to an employee from an employer upon the employee's termination, resignation, retirement, or other separation from employment for accrued sick time that has not been used.\nj. If an employee is transferred to a separate division, entity or location in the city of New York, but remains employed by the same employer, such employee is entitled to all [sick] safe/sick time accrued at the prior division, entity or location and is entitled to retain or use all [sick] safe/sick time as provided pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. When there is a separation from employment and the employee is rehired within six months of separation by the same employer, previously accrued [sick] safe/sick time that was not used shall be reinstated and such employee shall be entitled to use such accrued [sick] safe/sick time at any time after such employee is rehired, provided that no employer shall be required to reinstate such [sick] safe/sick time to the extent the employee was paid for unused accrued [sick] safe/sick time prior to separation and the employee agreed to accept such pay for such unused [sick] safe/sick time.\n      \n      � 4. Sections 20-914, 20-915 and subdivision a of 20-916 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 46 for the year 2013, are amended to read as follows:\n      � 20-914 Use of [sick] safe/sick time. a.

For an absence of more than three consecutive work days for sick time, an employer may require reasonable documentation that the use of sick time was authorized by this subdivision. For sick time used pursuant to this subdivision, documentation signed by a licensed health care provider indicating the need for the amount of sick time taken shall be considered reasonable documentation and an employer shall not require that such documentation specify the nature of the employee's or the employee's family member's injury, illness or condition, except as required by law.\n      b. Safe time. \n      1. An employee shall be entitled to use safe time for absence from work due to any of the following reasons when the employee or a family member has been the victim of a family offense matter, sexual offense, stalking, or human trafficking: \n      (a) to obtain services from a domestic violence shelter, rape crisis center, or other shelter or services program for relief from a family offense matter, sexual offense, stalking, or human trafficking; \n      (b) to participate in safety planning, temporarily or permanently relocate, or take other actions to increase the safety of the employee or employee's family members from future family offense matters, sexual offenses, stalking, or human trafficking; \n      (c) to meet with a civil attorney or other social service provider to obtain information and advice on, and prepare for or participate in any criminal or civil proceeding, including but not limited to, matters related to a family offense matter, sexual offense, stalking, human trafficking, custody, visitation, matrimonial issues, orders of protection, immigration, housing, discrimination in employment, housing or consumer credit; \n      (d) to file a complaint or domestic incident report with law enforcement; \n      (e) to meet with a district attorney's office; \n      (f) to enroll children in a new school; or \n      (g) to take other actions necessary to maintain, improve, or restore the physical, psychological, or economic health or safety of the employee or the employee's family member or to protect those who associate or work with the employee.\n      2. For an absence of more than three consecutive work days for safe time, an employer may require reasonable documentation that the use of safe time was authorized by this subdivision. For safe time used pursuant to this subdivision, documentation signed by an employee, agent, or volunteer of a victim services organization, an attorney, a member of the clergy, or a medical or other professional service provider from whom the employee or that employee's family member has sought assistance in addressing family offense matters, sex offenses, stalking, or human trafficking and their effects; a police or court record; or a notarized letter from the employee explaining the need for such time shall be considered reasonable documentation and an employer shall not require that such documentation specify the details of the family offense matter, sexual offense, stalking, or human trafficking.\n      c. An employer may require reasonable notice of the need to use [sick] safe/sick time. Where such need is foreseeable, an employer may require reasonable advance notice of the intention to use such [sick] safe/sick time, not to exceed seven days prior to the date such [sick] safe/sick time is to begin. Where such need is not foreseeable, an employer may require an employee to provide notice of the need for the use of [sick] safe/sick time as soon as practicable.\n      [c. For an absence of more than three consecutive work days, an employer may require reasonable documentation that the use of sick time was authorized by subdivision a of this section. For sick time used pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2 of subdivision a of this section, documentation signed by a licensed health care provider indicating the need for the amount of sick time taken shall be considered reasonable documentation and an employer shall not require that such documentation specify the nature of the employee's or the employee's family member's injury, illness or condition, except as required by law.]\n      d. Nothing herein shall prevent an employer from requiring an employee to provide written confirmation that an employee used [sick] safe/sick time pursuant to this section.\n e. An employer shall not require an employee, as a condition of taking [sick] safe/sick time, to search for or find a replacement worker to cover the hours during which such employee is utilizing time.\n      f. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit an employer from taking disciplinary action, up to and including termination, against a worker who uses [sick] safe/sick time provided pursuant to this chapter for purposes other than those described in this section.\n      � 20-915 Changing schedule. Upon mutual consent of the employee and the employer, an employee who is absent for a reason listed in subdivision a of section 20-914 of this chapter may work additional hours during the immediately preceding seven days if the absence was foreseeable or within the immediately subsequent seven days from that absence without using [sick] safe/sick time to make up for the original hours for which such employee was absent, provided that an adjunct professor who is an employee at an institute of higher education may work such additional hours at any time during the academic term. An employer shall not require such employee to work additional hours to make up for the original hours for which such employee was absent or to search for or find a replacement employee to cover the hours during which the employee is absent pursuant to this section. If such employee works additional hours, and such hours are fewer than the number of hours such employee was originally scheduled to work, then such employee shall be able to use [sick] safe/sick time provided pursuant to this chapter for the difference. Should the employee work additional hours, the employer shall comply with any applicable federal, state or local labor laws.\n      � 20-916 Collective bargaining agreements. a. The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to any employee covered by a valid collective bargaining agreement if (i) such provisions are expressly waived in such collective bargaining agreement and (ii) such agreement provides for a comparable benefit for the employees covered by such agreement in the form of paid days off; such paid days off shall be in the form of leave, compensation, other employee benefits, or some combination thereof. Comparable benefits shall include, but are not limited to, vacation time, personal time, [sick] safe/sick time, and holiday and Sunday time pay at premium rates.\n      � 5. Subdivisions a and b of section 20-919 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 46 for the year 2013, subdivision a as amended by local law number 6 for the year 2014, are amended to read as follows:\n      � 20-919 Notice of rights. a. 1.

Such notice shall be in English and the primary language spoken by that employee, provided that the department has made available a translation of such notice in such language pursuant to subdivision b of this section. Such notice may also be conspicuously posted at an employer's place of business in an area accessible to employees.\n      2. Notices provided to employees pursuant to this section on and after the effective date of this paragraph shall in addition inform employees of their right to safe time under this chapter. Employers shall give employees who have already received notice of their right to sick time pursuant to this section notice of their right to safe time within thirty days of the effective date of this paragraph.\n      b.
