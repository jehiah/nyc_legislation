Paragraph (d) of subdivision 1 of section 3-703 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 34 for the year 2007, is amended to read as follows:\n      (d) obtain and furnish to the campaign finance board, and his or her principal committee or authorized committees must obtain and furnish to the board, any information it may request relating to his or her campaign expenditures or contributions and furnish such documentation and other proof of compliance with this chapter as may be requested by such board, provided, however, that the board shall accept such required documentation through an electronically scanned transmission. For contributions submitted in support of a claim for matching funds, the following records shall be maintained by a candidate and his or her principal or authorized committee:\n      (i) for a contribution by cash, a contribution card containing the contributor's name and residential address and the amount of the contribution;\n      (ii) for a contribution by money order, a copy of the money order, provided that a contribution card containing the contributor's name and residential address shall be required if such information is not printed upon such money order by the issuing institution;\n      (iii) for a contribution by check, a copy of the check, made out to the principal or authorized committee, provided that a contribution card from the contributor demonstrating an intent to contribute shall be required if such check is signed by a person other than the contributor;\n      (iv) for a contribution by credit card, text message contribution or other contribution from a payment account, a record from the merchant, processor or vendor containing the contributor's name, residential address, the amount of the contribution and an indicator showing that the contribution was charged to the contributor's account and processed. For a contribution by text message, the contributor's phone number must also be included, as well as the name, residential address and phone number of the registered user of the specific mobile device used to initiate the contribution, to the extent such information may be reasonably obtained under law;\n      (v) A contribution card shall not be required, except where specified, for contributions pursuant to subparagraphs (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this paragraph.
