  "Summary": "The bill would require the Human Resources Administration (HRA) to provide rental subsidy recipients with a written statement explaining the protections of Section 26-521 of the Administrative Code, which prohibits unlawful evictions. The bill would require HRA to provide the notice when the applicant initially applies for the subsidy and at any point HRA determines to be appropriate. If the applicant chooses, HRA may send the notice electronically.",
