  "Summary": "This bill would require DCA to provide information to immigrants on consumer protection issues, including: financial institutions that accept IDNYC or ITIN; risks of non-bank financial institutions; state and local laws that regulate employment and immigration assistance services; federal and state laws regulating tax preparers; and information on local institutions that provide resources to immigrant communities. The educational material would also include information about the DCA’s Office of Financial Empowerment. The material would be made available on DCA’s website, translated into the six most common LEP languages, and submitted to the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs. The program would begin on September 1, 2016.",
