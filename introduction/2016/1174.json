Providing free, blood pressure machines for public use would enable citizens, especially un- and under-insured, at-risk individuals, to routinely monitor their blood pressures and possibly encourage them to seek medical treatment, or make life changes to lower their blood pressures in the event self-testing consistently reveals elevated levels. This law could therefore potentially save lives.","TextID":57724,"Text":"Int.
