  "Summary": "In 2015, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation issued a permit, under the federal Clean Water Act and the State Environmental Conservation Law, governing the operation of New York City’s municipal separate storm sewer systems (“MS4 Permit”), which governs stormwater infrastructure owned and operated by all City agencies, and requires management practices to reduce discharges of pollutants in stormwater runoff from all municipal operations and facilities in the MS4 area.  This bill will fulfill the requirement in the MS4 Permit that the City demonstrate adequate legal authority to implement and enforce the terms of the Permit.  In particular, the bill provides the City authority to act in a regulatory capacity to oversee and/or enforce requirements regarding activities that have the potential to contribute pollutants to stormwater runoff and the water bodies surrounding the City.  Two of the programs addressed in the bill – involving stormwater runoff from commercial and industrial activities, and runoff from active construction sites and newly developed or redeveloped sites – involve the City taking over administration of existing State stormwater programs within the MS4 area.  The third program, illicit discharge detection and elimination, continues, with minor updates, NYCDEP’s robust existing program to detect and address illicit discharges to the sewer system, and applies citywide.",

Title 24 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new chapter 5-A to read as follows:\nCHAPTER 5-A\nWATER POLLUTION CONTROL\nSUBCHAPTER 1\nGENERAL\n\t� 24-540 Policy.  Land development and associated increases in site impervious cover increase stormwater runoff causing flooding, soil erosion, and sediment transport and deposition in waterways.  A high percentage of impervious area correlates with a higher rate of stormwater runoff, which generates greater pollutant loadings to the city's separate stormwater and combined sewer systems.  Pollutants found in urban runoff include, but are not limited to, nitrogen, phosphorus, silt and sediment, pathogens, floatables, petroleum hydrocarbons, heavy metals, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). \n      Clearing and grading during construction may increase soil erosion and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitats.  Improperly designed and constructed stormwater management practices increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing erosion and sedimentation.  Impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow.  Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff from land development activities.  Regulation of land development activities by means of performance standards governing long-term stormwater management and site design produces development compatible with the natural functions of a particular site and thereby mitigates the adverse effects of erosion and sedimentation from development.  \n      Material handling and storage, equipment maintenance and cleaning, and other activities at industrial facilities are often exposed to stormwater, which can pick up pollutants and transport them to surface waters directly or via a storm sewer.  Appropriate stormwater management at industrial facilities can reduce these impacts.\n      This chapter establishes stormwater management controls meeting the requirements of state and federal law in areas of the city where stormwater does not pass through wastewater treatment plants before it enters the waters of the state.  In these areas water borne pollutants in stormwater runoff are more likely to enter and have an adverse impact on the waters of the state.  \n      The purpose and intent of this chapter is to (i) reduce pollutants discharged in stormwater runoff from construction activities in such areas to the maximum extent practicable through appropriate erosion and sediment controls; (ii) minimize, to the maximum extent practicable, increases in stormwater runoff volume and velocity, and pollutant loading in stormwater runoff, from development sites in such areas; (iii) ensure the proper maintenance of post-construction stormwater management practices; and (iv) ensure compliance by certain industrial facilities in such areas with applicable requirements to manage stormwater runoff in order to reduce pollutants in stormwater from industrial activities to the maximum extent practicable.\n      � 24-541  Definitions.

Title 24 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new chapter 5-A to read as follows:\\par\n\\pard\\ltrpar\\hyphpar0\\li360\\sl480\\slmult1\\qc\\ul CHAPTER 5-A\\par\nWATER POLLUTION CONTROL\\par\nSUBCHAPTER 1\\par\nGENERAL\\par\n\\pard\\ltrpar\\hyphpar0\\sl480\\slmult1\\qj\\ulnone\\tab\\ul\\'a7 24-540 Policy.  Land development and associated increases in site impervious cover increase stormwater runoff causing flooding, soil erosion, and sediment transport and deposition in waterways.  A high percentage of impervious area correlates with a higher rate of stormwater runoff, which generates greater pollutant loadings to the city\\rquote s separate stormwater and combined sewer systems.  Pollutants found in urban runoff include, but are not limited to, nitrogen, phosphorus, silt and sediment, pathogens, floatables, petroleum hydrocarbons, heavy metals, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). \\par\n\\pard\\ltrpar\\hyphpar0\\fi720\\sl480\\slmult1\\qj Clearing and grading during construction may increase soil erosion and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitats.  Improperly designed and constructed stormwater management practices increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing erosion and sedimentation.  Impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow.  Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff from land development activities.  Regulation of land development activities by means of performance standards governing long-term stormwater management and site design produces development compatible with the natural functions of a particular site and thereby mitigates the adverse effects of erosion and sedimentation from development.  \\par\nMaterial handling and storage, equipment maintenance and cleaning, and other activities at industrial facilities are often exposed to stormwater, which can pick up pollutants and transport them to surface waters directly or via a storm sewer.  Appropriate stormwater management at industrial facilities can reduce these impacts.\\par\nThis chapter establishes stormwater management controls meeting the requirements of state and federal law in areas of the city where stormwater does not pass through wastewater treatment plants before it enters the waters of the state.  In these areas water borne pollutants in stormwater runoff are more likely to enter and have an adverse impact on the waters of the state.  \\par\nThe purpose and intent of this chapter is to (i) reduce pollutants discharged in stormwater runoff from construction activities in such areas to the maximum extent practicable through appropriate erosion and sediment controls; (ii) minimize, to the maximum extent practicable, increases in stormwater runoff volume and velocity, and pollutant loading in stormwater runoff, from development sites in such areas; (iii) ensure the proper maintenance of post-construction stormwater management practices; and (iv) ensure compliance by certain industrial facilities in such areas with applicable requirements to manage stormwater runoff in order to reduce pollutants in stormwater from industrial activities to the maximum extent practicable.\\par\n\\'a7 24-541  Definitions.
