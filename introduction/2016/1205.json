  "Summary": "This bill would amend Local Law 49 of 2014 which requires the Administration for Children’s Services (ACS) to report on high school graduation rates of youth in foster care. The bill would make technical amendments to age disaggregation categories in the local law and would add whether youth in foster care are on track to graduate high school in five years. The proposed bill would also require ACS to make all reports required pursuant to the proposed bill available on its website.",
