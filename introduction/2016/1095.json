  "Summary": "The bill would create a universal license for taxicab and for-hire vehicle drivers—eliminating separate licenses—and require that English language proficiency not be assessed through a written exam.",
  "TextID": 57488,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      Section 1. Subdivision a of section 19-505 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 115 for the year 1993, is amended to read as follows:\n      a. No person shall drive any motor vehicle for hire which is regulated by the provisions of this chapter without first obtaining from the commission:\n      (i) a taxicab or universal driver's license, if the vehicle driven is a taxicab; or\n      (ii) a coach driver's license, if the vehicle driven is a coach; or\n      (iii) a for-hire vehicle or universal driver's license, if the vehicle driven is a for-hire vehicle; or\n      (iv) a wheelchair accessible van driver's license, if the vehicle driven is a wheelchair accessible van; or\n      (v) a commuter van driver's license, if the vehicle driven is a commuter van.\n      The issuance of a license to a person to drive any one of the aforementioned licensed vehicles shall not entitle such person to drive any other such licensed vehicle without first obtaining the additional appropriate driver's license, except that a person who has obtained a universal driver's license shall be entitled to drive a taxicab and for-hire vehicle without obtaining an additional commission-issued driver's license. The commission shall not issue taxicab driver's licenses or for-hire vehicle driver's licenses. Each taxicab driver's license and for-hire vehicle driver's license issued and in effect, including any such license which is suspended, shall be deemed a universal driver's license. For purposes of this section, a universal driver's license is a license which authorizes a driver to drive taxicabs and for-hire vehicles.\n      � 2. Section 19-505 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new subdivision r to read as follows:\n      r.  Any procedures established by the commission to determine the ability of an applicant for a universal driver's license to speak and understand English shall not include a written examination.\n      � 3. Paragraph 1 of subdivision a of section 19-507.1 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 30 for the year 2014, is amended to read as follows:\n      (1) Any taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver may attend a remedial or refresher course approved by the commission. Upon presentation to the commission of proof of satisfactory completion of a commission-approved course by such driver, three points shall be deducted from the number of points assessed under the persistent violators program against his or her [taxicab or for-hire vehicle] commission-issued driver's license, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph. A taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver shall be eligible for a point reduction pursuant to this subdivision only once within a five-year period. In the event no such approved course is available at the time such driver seeks to enroll, such driver may take a course provided for in paragraph one of subdivision c of section 19-507.2 of this chapter. In such instance, completion of a course taken pursuant to this paragraph or pursuant to paragraph one of subdivision c of section 19-507.2 shall result in the removal of three points from either the number of points accrued under the persistent violators program or from the number of points accrued under the critical drivers program, but not from both, upon the election of the driver who completes such course.\n      � 4. Subdivision b of section 19-507.1 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 30 for the year 2014, is amended to read as follows:\n      b. Any taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver who has been found guilty of violations of the commission's rules such that six or more points but fewer than ten points have been assessed against his or her [taxicab or for-hire vehicle] commission-issued driver's license within any fifteen-month period and whose license has not been revoked shall have his or her [taxicab or for-hire vehicle] commission-issued driver's license suspended for up to thirty days.\n      � 5. Subdivision c of section 19-507.1 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 30 for the year 2014, is amended to read as follows:\n      c. Any taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver who has been found guilty of violations of the commission's rules such that ten or more points have been assessed against his or her [taxicab or for-hire vehicle] commission-issued driver's license within any fifteen-month period shall have his or her [taxicab or for-hire vehicle] commission-issued driver's license revoked.\n      � 6. Subdivision e of section 19-507.1 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 30 for the year 2014, is amended to read as follows:\n      e. A taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver shall not be subject to an assessment of points against his or her [taxicab or for-hire vehicle] commission-issued driver's license or the imposition of duplicate penalties where the same act is a violation under provisions of law other than commission rules and where such violations duplicate each other or are substantively the same and any such driver may be issued only one summons or notice of violation for such violation. Points assessed pursuant to section 19-507.2 of this chapter may, pursuant to subdivisions i and j of this section, be added to points assessed by the commission under this section for violations of commission rules.\n      � 7. Subdivision h of section 19-507.1 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 20 for the year 1999, is amended to read as follows:\n      h.
