  "Summary": "This bill would prohibit donations above $400 per year from people who are lobbyists, have city contracts, or who otherwise do business with the city to non-governmental entities controlled by a local elected official or their agents. This limit would only apply to organizations that spend 10% or more of their annual budget on public-facing communications that feature the name or picture of the elected official who controls them.\r\n\r\nThis bill would also require donor disclosure for all non-governmental entities controlled or recently created by a local elected official or their agents, whether or not they engage in public-facing communications that feature the name or picture of the elected official who controls them. This information would be available on the website of the Conflicts of Interest Board, which would be responsible for administering the law.",
