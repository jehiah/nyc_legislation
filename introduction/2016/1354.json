  "Summary": "This bill would establish a timeline for statement reviews to be returned to candidates prior to the next disclosure filing deadline, as well as a timeline for candidate responses. The bill would also require a matchable contribution not be invalidated in subsequent statement reviews unless the Campaign Finance Board learns of new information relevant to the eligibility of that contribution.",

  "Text": "Int. No. 1354-A\nBy Council Members Greenfield, Menchaca and Rosenthal\n\n..Title\nA Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the timing of statement reviews\n..Body\n\nBe it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\tSection 1. Paragraph (b) of subdivision (12) of section 3-703 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\n      (b) The board shall review each disclosure report timely submitted by a candidate prior to the last date upon which such candidate may file a certification pursuant to paragraph (c) of subdivision one of this section, or subdivision one of section 3-718, and issue to the candidate a review [before the next disclosure report is due.] within 30 days of the date upon which such disclosure report was due, provided a candidate may agree to an extension of time for such review by the board. Any response from the candidate to such review shall be due no earlier than when the next disclosure report is due. Such review shall inform the candidate of relevant questions the board has concerning the candidate's: (i) compliance with requirements of this chapter and of the rules issued by the board; and (ii) qualification for receiving public funds pursuant to this chapter. In the course of this review, the board shall give candidates an opportunity to respond to and correct potential violations, before the deadline for filing a certification pursuant to paragraph (c) of subdivision one of this section, or subdivision one of section 3-718, and give candidates an opportunity to address questions the board has concerning their matchable contribution claims or other issues concerning eligibility for receiving public funds pursuant to this chapter; provided, however, this paragraph shall not apply to the last required disclosure report before the deadline for filing a certification pursuant to paragraph (c) of subdivision one of this section or subdivision one of section 3-718. Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude the board from subsequently reviewing such disclosure reports and taking any action otherwise authorized under this chapter, provided that the board shall not invalidate a matchable contribution claim in a subsequent review unless the board learns of new information that is relevant to the eligibility for matching of such contribution claim and that was not available to the board at the time of the initial review.\n      ï¿½ 2. This local law takes effect immediately after it becomes law.\n\nBJR\nLS 9478\n12/07/16  5:26PM\n1\n\n\n",
