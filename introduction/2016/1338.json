Upon the direction of the mayor, or at the request of the head of a department or agency of the city, or at the request of a district attorney of any county within the city, or at the request of a member of the city council with respect to the public nuisances defined in subdivisions (a), (g), and (h) [and] of section 7-703 [of this chapter], or upon his or her own initiative, the corporation counsel may bring and maintain a civil proceeding in the name of the city in the supreme court to permanently enjoin a public nuisance within the scope of this subchapter, and the person or persons conducting, maintaining or permitting the public nuisance from further conducting, maintaining or permitting the public nuisance. The corporation counsel shall ensure that records sealed pursuant to the criminal procedure law are not used in any action filed pursuant to this section. The owner, lessor and lessee of a building, erection or place wherein the public nuisance as being conducted, maintained or permitted shall be made defendants in the action.
