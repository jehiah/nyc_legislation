  "Summary": "This bill would codify the existence and role of the Department of Investigation’s Inspector General for the Department of Correction. This role would be analogous to the role of the Inspector General of the New York City Police Department, and would include submitting a yearly report regarding evaluations and recommendations related to the Department of Correction.",
  "TextID": 58629,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      Section 1.  Section 803 of the New York city charter is amended by adding a new subdivision d, relettering subdivisions d through f as subdivisions e through g, and amending relettered subdivisions e and f to read as follows:\n      d. 1. The commissioner shall, immediately upon appointment of the individual described in paragraph 2 of this subdivision, in addition to the investigatory work done in the normal course of the commissioner's duties, on an ongoing basis, conduct system-wide investigations, reviews, studies, and audits, and make recommendations regarding system-wide operations, policies, programs, and practices of the department of correction, with the goal of improving conditions in city jails, including but not limited to, reducing violence in departmental facilities, protecting the safety of departmental employees and inmates, protecting the rights of inmates, and increasing the public's confidence in the department of correction. The commissioner may consider, in addition to any other information the commissioner deems relevant, information regarding civil actions filed in state or federal court against individual correction officers or the city regarding the department of correction, notices of claim received by the comptroller filed against individual correction officers or the city regarding the department of correction, settlements by the comptroller of claims filed against individual correction officers or the city regarding the department of correction, complaints received and investigations conducted by the board of correction, complaints received and any investigations regarding such complaints conducted by the department of correction, complaints received pursuant to section 804, and any criminal arrests or investigations of individual correction officers known to the department of investigation in its ongoing review of the department of correction.\n      2. No later than 90 days after the effective date of the local law that added this subdivision, the commissioner shall appoint an individual responsible for implementing the duties described in paragraph 1 of this subdivision and shall report to the council regarding the identity and qualifications of such individual, the number of personnel assigned or to be hired to assist such individual as deemed necessary by the commissioner, and the details of the management structure covering them.  In the event such individual is removed or resigns, the commissioner shall replace such individual within 90 days of such removal or resignation and shall provide notification of such replacement, and the identity and qualifications of the new individual responsible for overseeing the implementation of the duties described in paragraph 1 of this subdivision.\n      3. No officer or employee of an agency of the city shall take any adverse personnel action with respect to another officer or employee in retaliation for such person making a complaint to, disclosing information to, or responding to queries from the commissioner pursuant to activities undertaken pursuant to paragraph 1 of this subdivision unless the complaint was made or the information was disclosed with the knowledge that it was false or with willful disregard for its truth or falsity.  Any officer or employee who believes he or she has been retaliated against in violation of this subdivision may report such action to the commissioner as provided for in subdivision c of section 12-113 of the administrative code.\n      4. The department's website will provide a link for individuals to report any problems and deficiencies relating to the department of correction's operations, policies, programs and practices.  Individuals making such reports will not be required to provide personally identifying information.\n      [d.] e. 1. For any investigation made pursuant to subdivision a or b of this section, the commissioner shall prepare a written report or statement of findings and shall forward a copy of such report or statement to the requesting party, if any.
