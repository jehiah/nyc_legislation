  "Summary": "This bill would prohibit landlords from mandating medical treatment as a condition of occupancy, with the exception of family members and legitimate programs, such as rehabilitation clinics. This bill would also provide a cause of action to tenants who face such a mandate, allowing them to receive damages and reasonable attorney’s fees and court costs. This legislation also includes the imposition of such a mandate in the definition of harassment under the Housing Maintenance Code.",
