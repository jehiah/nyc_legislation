  "Summary": "The bill would provide the Business Integrity Commission (BIC) with broad powers to comprehensively regulate the heating oil industry.   Among other things, BIC would be given authority to issue licenses and suspend and/or revoke licenses to and from heating oil industry participants, perform background investigations on license-applicants, and require fingerprinting of principals, employees and individuals employed by the applicants whom BIC believes may lack good character, honesty and integrity. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the bill sets standards of conduct for licensees to protect against overcharging, shorting, and other forms of consumer fraud.  Requirements for licensees include registering all heating oil delivery vehicles with BIC; producing all heating oil delivery vehicles for inspection; maintaining records; billing consumers for heating oil in a form or manner prescribed by BIC; a prohibition against fraudulent schemes and business practices; and a prohibition against failing to cooperate with BIC investigations.  Violations would be punishable by both criminal and civil penalties, and by suspension or revocation of licenses.  In the case of unlicensed activity, BIC may impound vehicles.",
