  "Summary": "This bill would remove the time limitation for applying for relocation assistance and make clear that any tenant who moves out while a vacate order is in effect is entitled to appropriate relocation assistance from HPD. This legislation would also require posting of a sign at properties subject to a vacate order and would impose a penalty of at least $5,000 for each dwelling unit that is reoccupied while a vacate order is still in effect.",
