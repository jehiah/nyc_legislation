  "Summary": "This legislation makes clear that a tenant can verify occupancy by, at a minimum, submitting a lease or any two of the following documents:\r\n\r\n• A valid government-issued identification showing the tenant’s address;\r\n• A valid record from any government agency showing the tenant’s address;\r\n• A valid record relating to medical treatment (including a prescription) showing the tenant’s address;\r\n• A notarized written statement from the building owner;\r\n• A valid utility bill to the tenant at the building in question;\r\n• A notarized statement from a third-party, non-governmental service provider verifying that services were provided to the tenant at the building in question; and\r\n• Any other form of verification that HPD determines to be appropriate.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this legislation would require HPD to provide tenants who are denied relocation services with a written notice of such decision, the basis for such decision, and information on how to appeal such decision.",
