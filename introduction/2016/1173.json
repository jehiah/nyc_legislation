  "Summary": "This bill increases the maximum fees that a company may charge to tow certain vehicles. Currently, fees generally range from $125-$140 for towing (often including the first 3 days of car storage) and $15-27 per day for storage thereafter. The new fee limits would be:\r\n\r\nTo remove a vehicle parked in front of a private driveway or on private property: $225 for removal and 3 days of storage, plus $40 per extra day of storage. \r\n\r\nTo tow a passenger vehicle from an arterial roadway: $225, plus, if the owner has the car towed somewhere other than a storage facility, $5 per mile or part thereof.\r\n\r\nTo remove vehicles obstructing traffic, involved in an accident or under the rotation tow program: For a vehicle 10,000 pounds or less, $225 for removal, plus $40 per day for storage. For a heavier vehicle, $300 for removal, plus $100 per day for storage. In addition, a mileage fee of $5 for each mile or part thereof.\r\n \r\nThe bill also makes stylistic changes and corrects certain outdated cross-references.",
