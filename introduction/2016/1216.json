  "Summary": "Existing DCA rule prevents gas stations from allowing customers to pump gas while a refueling tank is delivering gasoline to the station’s underground storage tank. The purpose of this rule is to protect consumers from pumping water in with gasoline, which can damage vehicles. Advances in storage tank technology have eliminated the need for this rule. This local law would permit those gas stations that have such technology to allow customers to dispense gas while the station’s tank is being refueled.",
