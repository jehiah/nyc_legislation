  "Summary": "This bill would establish a new Division of Paid Care within the Office of Labor Standards, recognizing the growing importance of home care and child care workforces, the complex legal and policy issues involved, and the increasing needs of care recipients of every age. The Division would conduct public outreach campaigns and informational clinics to inform paid care workers of their rights; collect and publish information useful for paid care workers; coordinate with governmental agencies, advocacy groups, and other stakeholders; and develop related policies and programs. An Advocate within the Division, among other responsibilities and working with Division staff, would develop an intake and referral system for paid care workers to submit labor- and employment law-related complaints and would notify appropriate agencies about potential systemic legal violations.
