For locations with a license to sell alcohol, the bill would require 4 violations of this law to constitute a “nuisance” and restrict these violations to only those in which a reasonable would have been aware of such violation. The bill also restricts the application of this portion of the Nuisance Abatement Law to only “willful and flagrant” violations, for locations with a license to sell wine and beer but not a license to sell liquor.","TextID":59102,"Text":"Int.
