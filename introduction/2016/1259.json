  "Summary": "The New York City Human Rights Law (HRL) prohibits discrimination against individuals on the basis of certain protected statuses in connection with employment, apprentice and other job training programs, the operation of certain places of public accommodation, the sale or rental of housing accommodations, land or commercial space, lending practices, real estate services and related transactions, the granting of licenses and permits, and certain boycott activities. This bill would add actual or perceived uniformed service as a protected status under the HRL. Uniformed service would include current or prior service in the United States Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, the Commissioned Corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Commissioned Corps of the United States Public Health Services, the Army and Air National Guard, the organized militia of the state of New York or the organized militia of any other state, territory or possession of the United States, membership in any reserve component of the United States Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard, or being listed on the state reserve list or the state retired list or comparable status for any other state, territory or possession of the United States.",
