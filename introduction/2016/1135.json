  "Summary": "This bill would require the Mayor to appoint a department or official to oversee the coordination of efforts to address quality of life issues in local communities. The appointed coordinating agency would be required to take into account requests from council members, community boards, business improvement districts, community-based organizations, and others to annually develop a list of 10 areas that would benefit from inter-agency collaboration to address issues such as sanitation services, transportation problems, social services needs, public health issues, and public safety needs. With input from the agencies responsible for addressing such issues, the coordinating agency would create and execute plans to address the quality of life issues in the 10 areas, and submit reports detailing the progress made on the plans every 6 months to the individual or group who submitted the request for services and the council member representing the area and annual assessments to the Council.",
