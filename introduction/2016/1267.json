Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms have the following meanings:\n      Consent.

The term \"disclose\" means to disseminate as defined in subdivision 5 of section 250.40 of the penal law, or to publish as defined in subdivision 6 of section 250.40 of the penal law. \n      Intimate body parts.
