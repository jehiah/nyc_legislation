  "Summary": "This legislation would require that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), at the time the Preliminary and Executive Budgets are submitted to the Council, provide the Council with both human- and machine-readable versions of the documents. In addition, for all other budget documents containing data, as defined by the Open Data Law, that OMB posts on its website, the legislation would require that within 10 days of posting OMB must also post machine-readable versions of the documents on their website and on the Open Data Portal.",
