  "Summary": "This bill permits the dismissal of an action pursuant to the Nuisance Abatement Law if a similar proceeding has already been conducted or is being conducted in housing court or by the New York City Housing Authority, unless the city has a unique interest in the Nuisance Abatement action distinct from the other proceeding. The bill also requires consideration of fines imposed by the State Liquor Authority in Nuisance Abatement actions brought for violations of the Alcoholic Beverage Control.",

Any action for a permanent injunction brought under this chapter against a natural person shall be dismissed if legal proceedings based on the same or substantially similar factual allegations have been conducted or are being conducted in New York city civil court or by the New York city housing authority, unless the city has a unique and compelling interest that is substantially different from that of the plaintiff in the other legal proceeding. Such interest shall not include the speed with which such case could be resolved. For the purposes of this section, the term \"substantially similar factual allegations\" shall not be construed to include conduct or actions that occurred subsequent to the allegations included in the relevant legal proceedings conducted in New York city civil court or by the New York city housing authority.\n      � 7-729 Duplicate fines for public nuisances involving alcohol. To the extent practicable, fines imposed or expected to be imposed by the state liquor authority shall be taken into consideration in evaluating whether a disposition reached in an action brought under this chapter poses an excess burden on the defendant, pursuant to section 7-724.\n      � 2.
