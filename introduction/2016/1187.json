  "Summary": "This bill would amend Local Law 48 of 2014 which requires the Administration for Children’s Services (ACS) to report on whether youth in currently in foster care and who have recently aged out of care have government-issued identification disaggregated by the type of identification. The bill would add the total number of youth aged 17 in older in care and the total number of youth who aged out of care, and the total number of youth in those groups who obtained any type identification to the local law. The bill would also add the number of youth who only possess one form of government-issued personal identification both while they are in care and at the point the age out of care, disaggregated by the type of identification. The proposed bill would also require ACS to make all reports required pursuant to the proposed bill available on its website.",
