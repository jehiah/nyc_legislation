No permit to use or open any street, except for emergency work, shall be issued to any person within a five year period after the completion of the construction of a capital project set forth in such budget or plan relating to such street requiring resurfacing or reconstruction unless such person demonstrates that the need for the work could not have reasonably been anticipated prior to or during such construction. \n      c.
