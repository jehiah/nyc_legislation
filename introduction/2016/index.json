Key kiosks are particularly susceptible to unauthorized key copying because they are un-staffed, automatic machines that permit key reproduction from photographic images, such as those taken by a smart phone. By limiting such key copy images to deliberate, close range photographs on white backgrounds, creating an audit trail via a credit card swipe and finger print scan, and other measures, this bill may help deter those seeking to copy keys without the knowledge, authorization or consent of the key owners.","LastModified":"2017-12-22T17:27:20.03Z"}

Three hundred new permits, now referred to as supervisory licenses, would be issued each year beginning in 2019 until 2028. Thirty additional supervisory licenses would be issued each year over the same period to veterans, amounting to 10% of the total number. In 2021, the Commissioner of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene would evaluate the impact of the 990 supervisory licenses issued by that time and whether the continued issuance of such licenses are in the best interest of the city. Depending on the findings of the study, the Commissioner has the discretion to discontinue or reduce the number of supervisory licenses issued in subsequent years.  \r\n\r\nTo address the illegal transfer of permits, the new supervisory licenses requires at least one supervisory licensee to be present at a pushcart at all times. This new requirement will not be applied to existing permits. The bill will also increase the fees for all permits and supervisory licenses.\r\n\r\nImportantly, the bill creates a new dedicated vending law enforcement unit, which would exclusively enforce vending laws. It would focus first on those areas of the City with known vending enforcement challenges, and move to all areas as compliance improves. \r\n\r\nIt would also create a street vendor advisory board, which will include vendors, brick and mortar small businesses, representatives from community groups, labor unions, property owners, and city agencies, to examine the rules for duplicative, unclear, or unnecessary provisions.","LastModified":"2017-12-23T04:15:11.767Z"}

This bill will fulfill the requirement in the MS4 Permit that the City demonstrate adequate legal authority to implement and enforce the terms of the Permit.  In particular, the bill provides the City authority to act in a regulatory capacity to oversee and/or enforce requirements regarding activities that have the potential to contribute pollutants to stormwater runoff and the water bodies surrounding the City.  Two of the programs addressed in the bill – involving stormwater runoff from commercial and industrial activities, and runoff from active construction sites and newly developed or redeveloped sites – involve the City taking over administration of existing State stormwater programs within the MS4 area.  The third program, illicit discharge detection and elimination, continues, with minor updates, NYCDEP’s robust existing program to detect and address illicit discharges to the sewer system, and applies citywide.","LastModified":"2018-03-20T15:07:29.07Z"}
