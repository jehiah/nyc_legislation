Such schedule and identification of tax expenditures would be set in collaboration with the IBO. For each economic development tax expenditure reviewed and evaluated, the IBO would submit a report to the Council, and post such report on its website, which would include a description of the data considered and the methodology and assumptions used in such review and evaluation, an analysis of the effectiveness of the tax expenditure and whether the tax expenditure is achieving its intended goals, whether those goals are still relevant, and recommendations for future evaluations. The bill would state that agencies must provide the IBO with the information necessary for IBO to conduct its review and evaluation, and that such agencies must provide IBO and the Council with an explanation when the agencies cannot disclose certain information and include a citation to the laws that prohibit such disclosure. Finally, the bill would also repeal a provision of the Administrative Code that established a tax study commission, which has expired.","LastModified":"2017-05-03T18:43:49.41Z"}

Three hundred new permits, now referred to as supervisory licenses, would be issued each year beginning in 2019 until 2028. Thirty additional supervisory licenses would be issued each year over the same period to veterans, amounting to 10% of the total number. In 2021, the Commissioner of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene would evaluate the impact of the 990 supervisory licenses issued by that time and whether the continued issuance of such licenses are in the best interest of the city. Depending on the findings of the study, the Commissioner has the discretion to discontinue or reduce the number of supervisory licenses issued in subsequent years.  \r\n\r\nTo address the illegal transfer of permits, the new supervisory licenses requires at least one supervisory licensee to be present at a pushcart at all times. This new requirement will not be applied to existing permits. The bill will also increase the fees for all permits and supervisory licenses.\r\n\r\nImportantly, the bill creates a new dedicated vending law enforcement unit, which would exclusively enforce vending laws. It would focus first on those areas of the City with known vending enforcement challenges, and move to all areas as compliance improves. \r\n\r\nIt would also create a street vendor advisory board, which will include vendors, brick and mortar small businesses, representatives from community groups, labor unions, property owners, and city agencies, to examine the rules for duplicative, unclear, or unnecessary provisions.","LastModified":"2017-12-23T04:15:11.767Z"}

This bill will fulfill the requirement in the MS4 Permit that the City demonstrate adequate legal authority to implement and enforce the terms of the Permit.  In particular, the bill provides the City authority to act in a regulatory capacity to oversee and/or enforce requirements regarding activities that have the potential to contribute pollutants to stormwater runoff and the water bodies surrounding the City.  Two of the programs addressed in the bill – involving stormwater runoff from commercial and industrial activities, and runoff from active construction sites and newly developed or redeveloped sites – involve the City taking over administration of existing State stormwater programs within the MS4 area.  The third program, illicit discharge detection and elimination, continues, with minor updates, NYCDEP’s robust existing program to detect and address illicit discharges to the sewer system, and applies citywide.","LastModified":"2018-03-20T15:07:29.07Z"}

For example, the DOB is prohibited from issuing a building permit for expansion to a nursing home with more than 300 beds that has received more than 10 Standard Health citations or more than 12 Life Safety Code citations in the aggregate for its three most recent NYS DOH surveys. An exception is made where the issuance of a permit is necessary to correct an outstanding violation of the New York City Construction Codes or of any other applicable provision of law or rule, or where the DOB Commissioner determines that a permit is necessary to perform work to protect public health and safety.","LastModified":"2017-12-23T04:22:11.307Z"}
