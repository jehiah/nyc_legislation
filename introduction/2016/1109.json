  "Summary": "The bill would provide the Department of Transportation the ability to designate pedestrian plazas, with all existing plazas grandfathered in; the authority to promulgate general rules of conduct applicable to all plazas and rules to regulate the use of and activities within individual pedestrian plazas and adjacent sidewalks. In addition, an agency or office designated by the Mayor would be required to promulgate rules establishing a process for the issuance of permits for events within pedestrian plazas and pertaining to the management of pedestrian plaza operations during events.",
  "TextID": 57565,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      Section 1. Declaration of legislative intent and findings. a. The Council finds and declares that as public amenities, pedestrian plazas enhance quality of life in New York City and help to attract tourism by providing a place for community gathering, entertainment, and cultural events, recreation, and active and passive enjoyment of the unique urban spaces in this City. However, there is a need to coordinate the wide variety of sometimes conflicting civic and commercial uses of these finite spaces, as well as to create an ambiance that helps enrich local communities and attract tourists, who are vital to the City's economy and foster economic development. Among other concerns, some pedestrian plazas face high levels of pedestrian congestion and/or activity that interfere with residents' and tourists' ability to enjoy these spaces and their unique qualities. \n      b. The Council finds that it is necessary and appropriate to confer authority on the New York City Department of Transportation to promulgate reasonable time, place, and manner regulations governing pedestrian plazas in order to manage the competing uses of finite public space. Given the wide diversity of pedestrian plazas, this law will allow the Department to draft both uniform pedestrian plaza rules and rules appropriately tailored to individual pedestrian plazas and the communities they serve. Further, it is necessary and appropriate to authorize the Department of Transportation to designate and remove the designation of plazas, with all existing plazas grandfathered in, and for an agency or office designated by the Mayor to promulgate rules establishing a process for the issuance of permits for events within pedestrian plazas and pertaining to the management of pedestrian plaza operations during events.\n      � 2. Title 19 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to add a new section 19-157 to read as follows:\n      � 19-157 Pedestrian plazas. a. Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings:\n      Event. The term \"event\" means any activity within a pedestrian plaza where the activity will interfere with or obstruct the regular use of such pedestrian plaza, but shall not include activities conducted pursuant to a valid film permit, demonstrations, or parades. \n      Pedestrian plaza. The term \"pedestrian plaza\" means an area designated by the department as such for pedestrian circulation, use and enjoyment on property under the jurisdiction of the department including, but not limited to, property mapped as a public place or property within the bed of a roadway, and which may contain amenities such as tables, seating, trees, plants, lighting, bike racks, or public art.\n      Pedestrian plaza partner.

Declaration of legislative intent and findings. a. The Council finds and declares that as public amenities, pedestrian plazas enhance quality of life in New York City and help to attract tourism by providing a place for community gathering, entertainment, and cultural events, recreation, and active and passive enjoyment of the unique urban spaces in this City. However, there is a need to coordinate the wide variety of sometimes conflicting civic and commercial uses of these finite spaces, as well as to create an ambiance that helps enrich local communities and attract tourists, who are vital to the City\\rquote s economy and foster economic development. Among other concerns, some pedestrian plazas face high levels of pedestrian congestion and/or activity that interfere with residents\\rquote  and tourists\\rquote  ability to enjoy these spaces and their unique qualities. \\par\nb. The Council finds that it is necessary and appropriate to confer authority on the New York City Department of Transportation to promulgate reasonable time, place, and manner regulations governing pedestrian plazas in order to manage the competing uses of finite public space. Given the wide diversity of pedestrian plazas, this law will allow the Department to draft both uniform pedestrian plaza rules and rules appropriately tailored to individual pedestrian plazas and the communities they serve. Further, it is necessary and appropriate to authorize the Department of Transportation to designate and remove the designation of plazas, with all existing plazas grandfathered in, and for an agency or office designated by the Mayor to promulgate rules establishing a process for the issuance of permits for events within pedestrian plazas and pertaining to the management of pedestrian plaza operations during events.\\par\n\\'a7 2.
