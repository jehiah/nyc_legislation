  "Summary": "This bill would require the Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), the 311 Citizen Service Center and the Police Department to report on complaints of sexual harassment or sex offenses, as defined in article 130 of the New York State Penal Law, occurring in TLC licensed vehicles.  The TLC, as the lead agency, must produce a report that includes complaint data compiled from its records, all TLC licensed entities, and from the reports of the 311 Citizen Service Center and the Police Department. The TLC report must disaggregate the data by the type of complaint, the type of TLC licensed vehicle, and the licensed entity or city body receiving the complaint. The TLC report must be provided to the Mayor and the City Council on December 1st, and posted on the Commission’s website. The purpose of the report is to provide greater clarity on the number of alleged sex offenses and complaints of sexual harassment occurring in TLC licensed vehicles.",
