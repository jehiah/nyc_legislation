  "Summary": "This bill would create a licensing requirement for key kiosks so that security and other standards can be imposed to deter unauthorized key copying. Key kiosks are particularly susceptible to unauthorized key copying because they are un-staffed, automatic machines that permit key reproduction from photographic images, such as those taken by a smart phone. By limiting such key copy images to deliberate, close range photographs on white backgrounds, creating an audit trail via a credit card swipe and finger print scan, and other measures, this bill may help deter those seeking to copy keys without the knowledge, authorization or consent of the key owners.",
