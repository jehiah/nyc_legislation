The bill would further establish that this priority would not apply where the Commissioner determines that a non-NYCHA property is in need of critical or emergency sidewalk repairs. In these cases, the Commissioner would be required to provide the reasons for this determination in writing to the council member and community board for the council and community district, respectively, where the NYCHA property that loses priority status is located.","TextID":58353,"Text":"Int.
