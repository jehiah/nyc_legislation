  "Summary": "This bill would require the Administration to establish and maintain a publicly accessible, searchable online list of written commitments made by the Mayor to the Council or a Council member in connection with most ULURP applications, including applications for neighborhood rezonings, amendments to the zoning resolution, dispositions of real property, and special permits that involve at least four adjacent blocks of real property.  For applications filed by the City or a non-profit controlled by the Mayor, such list shall include all commitments made by letter by the Mayor or a representative designated by the Mayor. For private applications, such list shall include only those commitments for which a funding amount of $1 million or more is specified in the letter establishing the commitment.  Commitments shall be logged in the list within 30 days of final approval of the application.  Beginning on June 30, 2017 and annually thereafter, the responsible agency shall report to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council on the progress of all commitments in the list.",
