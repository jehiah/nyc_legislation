  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) to create and maintain a watch list of certain multiple dwellings in the City that may risk becoming unaffordable. The bill would set criteria for inclusion on this watch list and would require HPD to publish the watch list on its website. Additionally, the bill would require the Department of Finance to assist HPD in determining certain financial information about covered multiple dwellings. The bill would also require the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications to make available on the City’s website a map of the multiple dwellings on the watch list. Finally, the bill would update cross-references and make other technical changes.",
