  "Summary": "Commercial bicyclists—those operating a bicycle on behalf of a business—and businesses utilizing the services of commercial bicyclists are subject to a number of safety and record-keeping requirements. These laws currently only apply to commercial bicyclists that are employees. The bill would amend these laws to cover commercial bicyclists that are classified as independent contractors.",
