In the instance where the notice of violation, appearance ticket or summons is issued for a breach of the provisions of subdivision [a] b of this section and sets forth thereon civil penalties only, such process shall be returnable to the environmental control board, which board shall have the power to impose the civil penalties hereinabove provided in subdivision [c] d of this section, provided further, that, notwithstanding any other provision of law, the environmental control board shall have such powers and duties as are set forth under section [twelve hundred twenty-a] 1220-a of the vehicle and traffic law.\n       [e.] f.

The commissioner shall have the power to establish regulations concerning the impoundment and release of vehicles and the payment of removal charges and storage fees for such vehicles, including the amounts and rate thereof.\n       (2) In addition to any other penalties provided in this section, the interest of an owner as defined in subdivision [c] d of this section in any vehicle impounded pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision shall be subject to forfeiture upon notice and judicial determination thereof if such owner (i) has been convicted of or found liable for a violation of this section in a civil or criminal proceeding or in a proceeding before the environmental control board three or more times, all of which violations were committed within an [eighteen] 18 month period or (ii) has been convicted of or found liable for a violation of this section in a civil or criminal proceeding or in a proceeding before the environmental control board if the material unlawfully dumped is a material identified as a hazardous waste or an acute hazardous waste in regulations promulgated pursuant to section 27-0903 of the environmental conservation law.\n       (3) Except as hereinafter provided, the city agency having custody of a vehicle, after judicial determination of forfeiture, shall no sooner than [thirty] 30 days after such determination upon a notice of at least five days, sell such forfeited vehicle at public sale.

Rewards. (1) Where a notice of violation, appearance ticket or summons is issued for a violation of subdivision [a] b of this section based upon a sworn statement by one or more individuals and where the commissioner determines, in the exercise of his or her discretion, that such sworn statement, either alone or in conjunction with testimony at a civil or criminal proceeding or in a proceeding before the environmental control board, results in the conviction of or the imposition of a civil penalty upon any person for a violation of subdivision [a] b of this section, the commissioner shall offer as a reward to such individual or individuals an amount that, in the aggregate, is equal to:\n       (i) [fifty] 50 percent of any fine or civil penalty collected; or\n       (ii) [five hundred dollars] $500 when a conviction is obtained, but no fine or civil penalty is imposed.\n       (2) Where a notice of violation, appearance ticket or summons is issued for a violation of subdivision [a] b of this section based upon information furnished by an individual or individuals and where the commissioner determines, in the exercise of his or her discretion, that such information, in conjunction with enforcement activity conducted by the department or another governmental entity, results in the conviction of or the imposition of a civil penalty upon any person for a violation of subdivision [a] b of this section, the commissioner shall offer as a reward to such individual or individuals an amount that, in the aggregate, is:\n       (i) up to [fifty] 50 percent of any fine or civil penalty collected; or\n       (ii) up to [five hundred dollars] $500 when a conviction is obtained, but no fine or civil penalty is imposed.\n       In determining the amount of the reward, the commissioner shall consider factors that include, but are not limited to: (a) the quantity and type of the material dumped, deposited or otherwise disposed of; (b) the specificity of the information provided, including, but not limited to, the license plate number, make or model or other description of the dump truck or other vehicle alleged to have been used and the location, date or time of the alleged violation; (c) whether the information provided by the individual or individuals identified one or more violations of subdivision [a] b of this section; and (d) whether the department has knowledge that violations of subdivision [a] b of this section have previously occurred at that location.\n       (3) No peace officer, employee of the department or of the environmental control board, or employee of any governmental entity that, in conjunction with the department, conducts enforcement activity relating to a violation of subdivision [a] b of this section shall be entitled to obtain the benefit of any such reward or obtain the benefit of such reward when acting in the discharge of his or her official duties.\n       [g.] h. In addition to the foregoing penalties the offender shall be required to clear and clean the area upon which the offender dumped unlawfully within [ten] 10 days after conviction thereof. In the event the offender fails to clear and clean the area within such time such clearing and cleaning may be done by the department or under the direction of the department by a private contractor and the cost of same shall be billed to the offender. In the event that the department has cleaned or cleared the area, or has caused the area to be cleaned or cleared by a private contractor prior to the offender's conviction, the offender shall be responsible for the cost of such clearing and or cleaning. Payment by such offender when required by this subdivision shall be made within [ten] 10 days of demand by the department.\n       [h.] i. The commissioner shall post a sign in any area where the commissioner deems appropriate because of instances of illegal dumping. Such sign shall state the penalties for illegal dumping and the reward provisions therein.\n      � 3.
