Doing so would enhance agency and vendor relations and promote payment efficiency by reducing the printing burdens on vendors that generate large numbers of procurement vouchers for services. This proposal would also have the added benefit of mitigating paper waste and alleviating its negative impact on the environment.","TextID":60277,"Text":"Int.
