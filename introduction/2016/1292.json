  "Summary": "This bill would require all city agencies, whenever practicable, to develop and implement standards for acceptance of electronic procurement vouchers from city vendors, rather than accepting such vouchers on printed paper. Doing so would enhance agency and vendor relations and promote payment efficiency by reducing the printing burdens on vendors that generate large numbers of procurement vouchers for services. This proposal would also have the added benefit of mitigating paper waste and alleviating its negative impact on the environment.",
