  "Summary": "This bill would ban “clopenings” for fast food employees; fast food employers would not be allowed to require fast food workers to work back-to-back shifts when the first shift closes the establishment and the second shift opens it the next day, with fewer than 11 hours in between. The employer will need to pay pay an employee who works a “clopening” shift $100 for each instance that such employee works such shifts.",
