  "Summary": "This bill would require the online posting of notifications about current and planned water service outages on the city’s website as well as the website of the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). Currently, real-time information about water outages is generally not provided online. Complaints to 311 are logged but no other information is provided in the normal course of business about planned or emergency outages and estimated times for service restoration. The proposed law would address this problem but would not replace DEP’s current practice of posting flyers in affected areas.",
