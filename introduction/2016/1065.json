The commissioner shall, on an ongoing basis, investigate, review, study, audit and make recommendations relating to the operations, policies, programs, and practices of the division of economic and financial opportunities of the department of small business services, as defined in section 1304 of the charter, with the goal of ensuring that the division effectively fulfills its duties as defined in subdivision a of section 1304 of the charter.\r\n      2. Not later than ninety days after the effective date of the local law that added this subdivision, the commissioner shall report to the council regarding the identity and qualifications of the individual responsible for overseeing the implementation of the duties described in paragraph 1 of this subdivision, the number of personnel assigned to assist that individual, and the details of the management structure covering them.  Upon removal or replacement of the individual responsible for overseeing the implementation of the duties described in paragraph 1 of this subdivision, notification of that removal or replacement, and the identity and qualifications of the new individual responsible for overseeing the implementation of the duties described in paragraph 1 of this subdivision, shall be provided to the council.\r\n      3. The mayor, in consultation with the department and the department of small business services, shall have the discretion to determine how sensitive information provided to the department in connection with any investigation, review, study, or audit undertaken pursuant to this section shall be treated.  The mayor shall provide the council with any guidelines, procedures, protocols or similar measures related to the treatment of sensitive information that he or she puts in place.  Sensitive information shall mean information concerning (a) ongoing civil or criminal investigations or proceedings; (b) the identity of confidential sources, including protected witnesses; (c) intelligence matters; or (d) other matters the disclosure of which would constitute a serious threat to the safety of the people of the department or the department of small business services.\r\n      4.

No officer or employee of an agency of the city shall take any adverse personnel action with respect to another officer or employee in retaliation for his or her making a complaint to, disclosing information to, or responding to queries from the commissioner pursuant to activities undertaken under paragraph 1 of this subdivision unless the complaint was made or the information was disclosed with the knowledge that it was false or with willful disregard for its truth or falsity.
