  "Summary": "This bill would require DCA to establish and implement an outreach and education program for women on consumer protection issues. These issues include: short- and long- term financial independence, including retirement; navigating public benefits programs; gender-based pricing; and common scams and predatory consumer and financial products. The educational material would also include information about the DCA’s Office of Financial Empowerment. The material would be made available on DCA’s website, translated into the six most common LEP languages, and submitted to the NYC Commission on Women’s Issues and the Mayor’s Office to Combat Domestic Violence. The required program would begin on September 1, 2016.",
