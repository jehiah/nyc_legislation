  "Summary": "This bill would require an advisory panel to recommend eligible works of art in a project administered by the Department of Cultural Affairs in the Percent for Art program. The bill would require that the panel be comprised of members who are knowledgeable about public art, about the project, and about the community in which the project will be located. The panel would also include, but not be limited to, at least one representative of the Borough President’s office of the borough in which the project will be located, at least one representative of the City Council Member in whose district the project will be located, and at least one representative of the community board for the community district in which the project will be located. These representatives would be non-voting ex-officio members.\r\n\r\nPercent for Art refers to the law that requires that one percent of the budget for eligible City-funded construction projects be spent on artwork for City facilities.",
