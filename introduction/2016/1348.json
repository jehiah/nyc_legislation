  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      Section 1.  Section 9-110 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:  \n      � 9-110 [Instruction] Education and programming.\n      The commissioner of correction may establish and maintain schools or classes for the instruction and training of the inmates of any institution under the commissioner's charge, and shall offer to all inmates incarcerated for more than 10 days a minimum of five hours per day of inmate programming or education, excluding weekends and holidays. Such programming or education may be provided by the department or by another provider, and need not be offered to inmates in punitive segregation, or to inmates who may be ineligible or unavailable for such programming or education, or where offering such programming or education would not be consistent with the safety of the inmate, staff or facility. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the department from offering such programming or education on the basis of incentive-based criteria developed by the department. For the purposes of this section, the term \"inmate programming\" has the same meaning as in section 9-144. \n      � 2.
