  "Summary": "This bill would prohibit city agencies from towing any vehicle unless it has first been immobilized with a wheel lock for at least 72 hours.  This law would not apply to vehicles parked illegally at bus stops or fire hydrants, in crosswalks or tow away zones, or that are blocking legal driveways. Nor would it apply when the immediate towing of a vehicle is required as a matter of public safety.",
