  "Summary": "This bill amends the Administrative Code of the City of New York Chapter 2 of title 4 of the administrative code of the city of New York by adding a new section 4-209 defining City-owned buildings and requiring a feasibility study of the costs of installing solar thermal energy systems on all buildings or structures owned by the city of New York, its agencies or departments, and where they are cost effective mandating the installation of city-owned solar hot water systems or thermal energy generation systems on those city-owned buildings where the feasibility study has found such systems to be cost-effective.  The bill also requires the department shall mail to property owners, together with the first property tax bill sent each year, a flyer that educates property owners as to the benefits of using solar hot water systems, including the financial, tax, and environmental benefits of installing such a system on their property.",

Department. The term \"department\" means the department of citywide administrative services.\n      b. The department, or any other agency authorized by the commissioner, shall, within one year from the effective date of the law that added this section, submit to the mayor and the council a feasibility study of all city-owned buildings identifying where solar water heating and thermal energy systems would be cost-effective.  The feasibility study shall describe any federal or state funds or incentives that would be available to defray costs related to the installation, operation or maintenance of such systems.\n      c. A solar water heating system shall be installed on all city-owned buildings where the feasibility study has found such system to be cost-effective, provided that the procurement and installation of such system conforms with all other applicable laws.
