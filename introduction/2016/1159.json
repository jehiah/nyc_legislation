  "Summary": "This bill amends the Administrative Code of the City of New York Chapter 2 of title 4 of the administrative code of the city of New York by adding a new section 4-209 defining City-owned buildings and requiring a feasibility study of the costs of installing solar thermal energy systems on all buildings or structures owned by the city of New York, its agencies or departments, and where they are cost effective mandating the installation of city-owned solar hot water systems or thermal energy generation systems on those city-owned buildings where the feasibility study has found such systems to be cost-effective.  The bill also requires the department shall mail to property owners, together with the first property tax bill sent each year, a flyer that educates property owners as to the benefits of using solar hot water systems, including the financial, tax, and environmental benefits of installing such a system on their property.",

Chapter 2 of title 4 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 4-207.2 to read as follows:\n      � 4-207.2 Solar water heating and thermal energy systems for city-owned buildings. a.

The term \"commissioner\" means the commissioner of citywide administrative services.\n      Cost-effective. The term \"cost effective\" means,   with respect to the installation of a solar water heating or thermal energy system, that the cumulative savings expected to result from such installation, including expected savings in energy costs, will in 25 years or less, equal or exceed the expected costs of such installation, less all federal, state and other non-city governmental assistance available to offset the cost of such installation and including the social cost of carbon value, as described in paragraphs 3 and 4 of subdivision d of section 3-125 of the code; provided, however, that a higher  site- or project-specific social cost of carbon value may be developed and used in lieu of the social cost of carbon value described in such paragraphs. Department. The term \"department\" means the department of citywide administrative services.\n      b. The department, or any other agency authorized by the commissioner, shall, within one year from the effective date of the law that added this section, submit to the mayor and the council a feasibility study of all city-owned buildings identifying where solar water heating and thermal energy systems would be cost-effective.  The feasibility study shall describe any federal or state funds or incentives that would be available to defray costs related to the installation, operation or maintenance of such systems.\n      c. A solar water heating system shall be installed on all city-owned buildings where the feasibility study has found such system to be cost-effective, provided that the procurement and installation of such system conforms with all other applicable laws.  The department may prioritize the installation of solar water heating systems based on the expected useful life of the currently installed water heating system, the expected cost savings of such solar water heating system, and by any other criteria determined by the commissioner.\n       d. Not later than December 15 of the year following the submission of the feasibility study, and every second year thereafter, the department shall report to the mayor and the council the following:\n      1. The number of city-owned buildings where the installation of a solar water heating or thermal energy system would be cost effective, and the projected annual energy and other cost savings for each such system, both individually and in the aggregate.\n      2. The number of city-owned buildings that have commenced installation of a solar water heating or thermal energy system.\n      3. The number of city-owned buildings that have completed the installation of a solar water heating or thermal energy system.\n      4. The annual energy and other cost savings, and any other environmental benefits associated with the systems of completed systems.\n      5. New or updated information regarding technological, pricing, or socio-economic issues pertaining to solar water heating and thermal energy systems.\n      � 2.  Subchapter 4 of chapter 3 of title 24 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 24-367 to read as follows:\t\n      � 24-367.Solar water heating system outreach. The department shall mail to property owners, with the first water bill sent each year, a notice describing the benefits of a solar water heating system, including the financial, tax, and environmental benefits of installing such system.   \n      � 3.
