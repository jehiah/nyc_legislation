  "Summary": "This bill amends the Administrative Code of the City of New York Chapter 2 of title 4 of the administrative code of the city of New York by adding a new section 4-209 defining City-owned buildings and requiring a feasibility study of the costs of installing solar thermal energy systems on all buildings or structures owned by the city of New York, its agencies or departments, and where they are cost effective mandating the installation of city-owned solar hot water systems or thermal energy generation systems on those city-owned buildings where the feasibility study has found such systems to be cost-effective.  The bill also requires the department shall mail to property owners, together with the first property tax bill sent each year, a flyer that educates property owners as to the benefits of using solar hot water systems, including the financial, tax, and environmental benefits of installing such a system on their property.",
