  "Summary": "The bill would require the City to install at least twenty-five electric vehicle charging stations in publicly accessible locations by March 1, 2018, with at least two stations in every borough, as part of a pilot program. The Electric Vehicle Advisory Committee would monitor the results of the program and make recommendations related to the installation of electric vehicle charging stations in the city, including the feasibility of on-street electric vehicle charging. The pilot would expire on March 1, 2020.",
