The office shall investigate potential violations and enforce the provisions of this chapter consistent with sections 20-a and 2203 of the charter and with all powers and duties described therein and according to rules and policies of the office. \n      b. Violations by fast food employers. 1. Except as provided in subdivision c of this section, an aggrieved fast food employee or duly authorized representative thereof or an aggrieved not-for-profit may file a complaint with the office regarding violations of this chapter by a fast food employer. Except for an allegation of retaliation in violation of section 20-1306, the office shall only investigate such a complaint if the relevant not-for-profit demonstrates that it has complied with sections 20-1303 and 20-1304 by providing a copy of the registration letter. \n      2. Except as otherwise provided in subdivision c of this section, if a fast food employer is found to have violated this chapter, including by retaliation, the office may award any of the following, in addition to any other remedy provided in the charter or other law: \n      (a) Deductions and remittances as authorized by the fast food employee and the payment of interest to the not-for-profit from the date of the failure to deduct or remit based on the interest rate then in effect as prescribed by the superintendent of banks pursuant to section 14-a of the banking law, but in any event at a rate of no less than six percent per year; and\n      (b) Payment of a further sum as a civil penalty in an amount not exceeding $500 for each violation of this chapter. However, in cases where a final disposition has been entered against a fast food employer twice within any consecutive three-year period determining that such fast food employer has willfully failed to deduct or remit funds in accordance with this chapter, or has retaliated against a fast food employee in violation of section 20-1306, the office may impose a civil penalty in an amount not exceeding $1,000 for each violation of this chapter.\n      (c) Reinstatement, back pay and other appropriate relief for any fast food employee found to have been subject to retaliation in violation of section 20-1306. \n3.

No procedure or remedy set forth in this section is exclusive of or a prerequisite for asserting a claim for relief to enforce any rights under this chapter in a court of competent jurisdiction. \n      c. Failure to honor a revocation. A fast food employer or a not-for-profit that the office finds has failed to honor the revocation of a fast food employee of voluntary deductions and instead has retained contributions after revocation shall refund the fast food employee the amount of the contribution wrongfully retained. If the refund to the fast food employee is not made within 60 days of receipt of the revocation by the party that retained the contribution, the office may require the payment of interest on the amount of the refund owed based on the rate then in effect as prescribed by the superintendent of banks pursuant to section 14-a of the banking law, but in any event at a rate of no less than six percent per year.\n      d. False or misleading disclosures to fast food employees. It is a violation of this chapter for a not-for-profit intentionally to make materially false or misleading disclosures to fast food employees under subdivision a of section 20-1304, and as set forth in rules prescribed by the director. Where a violation is established, such not-for-profit shall cure the false or misleading statements to fast food employees within 30 days. Upon establishing a second such violation within two years of a previous violation, the director shall revoke any previously issued letter of registration as set forth in subdivision b of section 20-1303. \n      e. The office shall make rules establishing a process for such interested parties as the office may identify by rule to petition the director to re-examine or revoke a not-for-profit's registration pursuant to this chapter. \n      f. Any party with rights under this chapter may bring an action pursuant to article 78 of the civil practice law and rules to enforce, vacate or modify an order, determination or other disposition of the office, the office of administrative trials and hearings or other relevant tribunal.\n\t� 20-1308  Civil action. a. Except as otherwise provided by law, any person claiming to be aggrieved by a fast food employer's violation of this chapter has a cause of action in any court of competent jurisdiction for damages, including punitive damages, and for injunctive relief and such other remedies as may be appropriate, if the relevant not-for-profit demonstrates that it has complied with sections 20-1303 and 20-1304 by providing a copy of the registration letter from the office unless such person has filed a complaint with the office with respect to such claim. If the court finds in favor of the plaintiff, it shall award such person, in addition to other relief, reasonable attorney's fees and costs.\n\tb. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of subdivision a of this section, if the office dismisses a complaint or the complaint is withdrawn, an aggrieved person maintains all rights to commence a civil action pursuant to this section.\n\t1. An employee need not file a complaint with the office before bringing a civil action; however, no person shall file a civil action after filing a complaint with the office unless such complaint has been withdrawn or dismissed without prejudice to further action. \n\t2. No person shall file a complaint with the office after filing a civil action unless such action has been withdrawn or dismissed without prejudice to further action.\n\tc. A civil action under this section shall be commenced in accordance with subdivision 2 of section 214 of the civil practice law and rules.\n\td. This chapter does not limit a fast food employee's right to bring any other action authorized by law. \n\t� 20-1309 Limitations period. The office shall not investigate violations of this chapter committed more than two years before the filing of a complaint or the commencement of such investigation, whichever is earlier. Each failure to comply with this chapter constitutes a separate violation; a pattern of such violations is a continuing violation for purposes of assessing the limitations period.\n      � 20-1310 Application; exclusion of labor organizations. a. This chapter does not discourage, prohibit, preempt or displace any law, regulation, rule, requirement, written policy or standard that is at least as protective of a fast food employee as the requirements of this chapter.\n      b. This chapter does not authorize deductions prohibited by section 193 of the labor law or remittances to labor organizations.

The office shall promulgate rules necessary to ensure that this law will be applied in a manner consistent with federal or state labor law and will not affect the relationship among workers or employees and employers, and the entities described in subdivision b, except as specifically provided in this chapter.\n      � 2. This local law takes effect 180 days after it becomes law and expires and is deemed repealed 2 years after such effective date.\n      \nMWC \n5/18/2017 2:46 PM\nLS 9052 and LS 8636\n\n2",
