  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Buildings to withhold building permits for certain properties where $25,000 or more in unpaid charges are owed to the city or where the owners of such properties owe, in aggregate, $25,000 or more in unpaid charges to the city. The bill provides certain exceptions to this prohibition, such as where the permit would be required to correct a dangerous condition.",
