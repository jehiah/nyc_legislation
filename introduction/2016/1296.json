  "Summary": "This bill would provide that at least one percent of the first 50 million dollars of capital funds appropriated by the city for a capital project be allocated for works of art. This bill would raise the threshold for the expenditure for works of art for any capital project to 900,000 dollars. This bill would also raise the threshold for expenditures for works of art in any fiscal year to 4 million dollars.",
