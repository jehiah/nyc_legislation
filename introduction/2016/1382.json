  "Summary": "This bill would require certain contractors employed to work on city-funded construction projects to disclose to an agency designated by the mayor, the zip code of their employees’ primary address; the address, block, and lot number of the city-funded construction project; and whether such contractor is certified as a minority-owned or women-owned business enterprise. This bill would also require the designated agency to make such disclosures public after the data collected is sufficiently anonymized as well as to report on observable trends in the data.  This bill would also create recordkeeping requirements for such contractors and would give the authority to enforce the provisions of this bill to the designated agency.",
