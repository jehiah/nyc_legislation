  "Summary": "This bill would gradually expand the number of permits to vend food on the streets and sidewalks of New York City. Three hundred new permits, now referred to as supervisory licenses, would be issued each year beginning in 2019 until 2028. Thirty additional supervisory licenses would be issued each year over the same period to veterans, amounting to 10% of the total number. In 2021, the Commissioner of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene would evaluate the impact of the 990 supervisory licenses issued by that time and whether the continued issuance of such licenses are in the best interest of the city. Depending on the findings of the study, the Commissioner has the discretion to discontinue or reduce the number of supervisory licenses issued in subsequent years.  \r\n\r\nTo address the illegal transfer of permits, the new supervisory licenses requires at least one supervisory licensee to be present at a pushcart at all times. This new requirement will not be applied to existing permits. The bill will also increase the fees for all permits and supervisory licenses.\r\n\r\nImportantly, the bill creates a new dedicated vending law enforcement unit, which would exclusively enforce vending laws. It would focus first on those areas of the City with known vending enforcement challenges, and move to all areas as compliance improves. \r\n\r\nIt would also create a street vendor advisory board, which will include vendors, brick and mortar small businesses, representatives from community groups, labor unions, property owners, and city agencies, to examine the rules for duplicative, unclear, or unnecessary provisions.",
