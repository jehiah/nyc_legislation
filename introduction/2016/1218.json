  "Summary": "This bill would increase the penalties for illegally converting residential space so that it contains three or more dwelling units above the amount legally allowed. The bill contains a one-time exception for owners that reasonably did not know of such conversion and who promptly took steps to correct the condition. The bill would also require that the Department of Buildings (DOB) seek to obtain an access warrant where it is unable to obtain access to a building where it suspects an illegal conversion has occurred.",

The commissioner may by rule establish such specified monthly penalties.\n\n3. \tFor lesser violations, a civil penalty of not more than [five hundred dollars] $500 may be imposed for each violation.\n\nExceptions:\n\n1. The owner, lessee, occupant, manager or operator of a building affected by a natural or man-made disaster, as determined by the commissioner, shall not be subject to a civil penalty for a violation involving such building if (i) notice of such violation is issued by the department during the 90-day period immediately after such disaster or, in the case of a major natural or man-made disaster as determined by the commissioner, during the six-month period immediately after such disaster, and (ii) such violation is corrected on or before 40 days after such disaster period or such greater amount of time as determined by the commissioner for such violation. The notice of such violation shall state that such violation is subject to this exception and shall set forth the procedure and time period for correcting such violation without incurring a civil penalty. This exception shall not apply to immediately hazardous violations, violations charged as aggravated violations or violations without connection to such disaster, as determined by the department.\n\n2.

Section 11-319 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new subdivision a-6 to read as follows:\n\ta-6.
