  "Summary": "This bill would require the Mayor’s Office of Operations to publish a quarterly report on its website about the findings of the Mayor’s Three-Quarter Housing Task Force. The Task Force is comprised of inspectors from the Human Resources Administration, Department of Buildings, the Fire Department, and the Department of Housing Preservation and Development and is tasked with inspecting dwellings suspected to be three-quarters houses. The reports would include information on the number of violations issued to each building, and the number of individuals relocated from each building, disaggregated by the type of assistance each individual received. The first report would cover data from June 1, 2015 through March 31, 2017.",
