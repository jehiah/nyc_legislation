  "Summary": "This bill would require the Office of Emergency Management (OEM) to create a website through which persons that are displaced, or out of communication, because of an emergency event can let others know where they are and how they are doing. After an emergency, people may be residing in evacuation centers, the residences of friends and family, or elsewhere. This website would provide a mechanism for letting a person make it be publicly known that they survived the emergency, and would allow them to privately share password-protected additional information, such as their current location and contact information. Only visitors to the website who knew the password would be able to view the additional information. Visitors to the website would be able to sign up for an e-mail notification whenever a person with a specified name registered for the website.\r\n\r\nThe bill would also require OEM to make information on the website available in all evacuation shelters and include it in their public awareness materials.",
