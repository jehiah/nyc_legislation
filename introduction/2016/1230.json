  "Summary": "This bill would require that the rooftops of buildings or structures in occupancy groups B, I-4, M, or S-2, as defined in section BC 302 of the New York city building code, be partially covered in plants, known as “green roofs,” solar panels or a combination of both. This legislation promotes energy efficient building practices, as green roofs filter pollutants and add agricultural space, and solar roofs encourage renewable energy generation and reduce air pollution.",
