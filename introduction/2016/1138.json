Members would be appointed within 90 days of enactment of this local law. Members would meet at least three times. The task force would be required to issue a report to the Mayor and the Speaker no later than October 15, 2017. The report would take into account the State’s role in substantially funding CUNY and would include, but not be limited to, an analysis of obstacles affecting the affordability of, admission to, and timely graduation from CUNY. The report would also address the feasibility of eliminating tuition at CUNY. After the report’s submission, the task force would cease to exist.",
