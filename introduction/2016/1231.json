The rebuttable presumption that violation of any laws or rules relating to ticket selling was caused by the place of entertainment, mode of transportation, or guided tour whose ticket is vended and/or the person on whose behalf the ticket is vended would not apply where the ticket is counterfeit or where the circumstances of the vending were not authorized or subject to the control of such venue.",
