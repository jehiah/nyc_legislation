An order granting a preliminary injunction shall direct a trial of the issues within three business days after joinder of issue or, if issue has already been joined, within three business days after the entry of the order. Where a preliminary injunction has been granted, the court shall render a decision with respect to a permanent injunction within three business days after the conclusion of the trial. A temporary closing order may be granted pending a hearing for a preliminary injunction where it appears by clear and convincing evidence that a public nuisance within the scope of this subchapter is being conducted, maintained or permitted and that the public health, safety or welfare immediately requires the granting of a temporary closing order. A temporary restraining order may be granted pending a hearing for a preliminary injunction where it appears by clear and convincing evidence that a public nuisance within the scope of this subchapter is being conducted, maintained or permitted.\n      � 2.
