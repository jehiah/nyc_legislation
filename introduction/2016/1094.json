  "Summary": "This bill would require an agency or office designated by the mayor to identify a set of factors related to natural gas violations that risk the safety of residential and commercial buildings. The bill would also require this designated agency to submit a report to the council on how such risk factors have been used to target enforcement of laws and rules relating to the delivery by pipe or usage of gas in residential and commercial buildings and the efficacy of such targeted enforcement.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection 1. Chapter 4 of title 24 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 24-425 to read as follows:  \n      � 24-425 Identification of gas safety risk factors. a. An agency or office designated by the mayor shall seek to identify risk factors that correlate to or otherwise indicate a violation of any law or rule that (i) relates to the delivery by pipe, or usage of, gas in residential or commercial buildings and (ii) poses a hazard to health and safety or a risk of damage to property. Such risk factors may include, but need not be limited to, unauthorized gas usage; unusual gas usage for a building based on its historic usage or usage for buildings of similar size, type or occupancy; abandoned structures; or structures condemned by the city.  \n      b. In developing such risk factors, such designated agency or office shall (i) seek the cooperation of each gas corporation that owns, operates or manages a gas plant located in whole or in part in the city and with each organized labor association that contracts with such corporations and (ii) share with each such corporation appropriate information necessary to minimize impacts of such risk factors. The terms \"gas corporation\" and \"gas plant\" as used in this section shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in section 2 of the public service law.\n      c. By December first 2017, and every third year thereafter, such designated office or agency shall submit to the mayor and the speaker of the council, and make publicly available online, a report on how the city has made use of such risk factors in targeting enforcement of laws and rules relating to the delivery by pipe or usage of gas in residential and commercial buildings and the efficacy of such targeted enforcement. \n\t� 2.
