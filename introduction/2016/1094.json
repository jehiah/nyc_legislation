  "Summary": "This bill would require an agency or office designated by the mayor to identify a set of factors related to natural gas violations that risk the safety of residential and commercial buildings. The bill would also require this designated agency to submit a report to the council on how such risk factors have been used to target enforcement of laws and rules relating to the delivery by pipe or usage of gas in residential and commercial buildings and the efficacy of such targeted enforcement.",

An agency or office designated by the mayor shall seek to identify risk factors that correlate to or otherwise indicate a violation of any law or rule that (i) relates to the delivery by pipe, or usage of, gas in residential or commercial buildings and (ii) poses a hazard to health and safety or a risk of damage to property. Such risk factors may include, but need not be limited to, unauthorized gas usage; unusual gas usage for a building based on its historic usage or usage for buildings of similar size, type or occupancy; abandoned structures; or structures condemned by the city.  \n      b.

The terms \"gas corporation\" and \"gas plant\" as used in this section shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in section 2 of the public service law.\n      c.
