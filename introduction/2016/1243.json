For purposes of this bill, suspensions imposed pursuant to failure to answer or pay penalties for violations of toll collection regulations, failure to make child support payments or to comply with a summons, subpoena or warrant relating to a paternity or child support proceeding, failure to pay past-due tax liabilities, and suspensions for certain drug offenses except for those related to the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence, would not apply.",
