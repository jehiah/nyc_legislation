The Commission would advise on ways to analyze the function and composition of city agencies through gender-based lens and ways to develop equitable recruitment strategies. The Commission would also make recommendations to the Mayor and the Council for the reduction of gender-based inequality. The Commission would hold at least one quarterly meeting, including at least one annual meeting open to the public, keep a record of its activities, determine its own rules of procedure, and perform such advisory duties and functions as may be necessary to achieve the aforementioned purposes. The Commission would submit to the Mayor and the Speaker a report on December 1, 2017 and annually thereafter on its activities for the previous year, its goals for the following year, and its recommendations.",
