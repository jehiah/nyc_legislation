  "Summary": "This bill would amend the timing of the commission appointed to review the compensation of elected officials by extending the amount of time a commission has to conduct a review and issue a report to 120 days following its appointment.  The bill would also amend the year in which the commission is appointed from the second year of a four-year cycle to the third year.",
  "TextID": 57270,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n      Section 1. Declaration of Legislative Findings and Intent. The Council recognizes that the commission appointed to review the compensation levels of elected officials is tasked with reviewing a significant amount of information to determine whether to recommend increases in compensation levels. The 2015 Quadrennial Advisory Commission held fifteen meetings, two public hearings and reviewed numerous records and other data in preparation for issuing its report and recommendations. In recognition of the considerable amount of work involved in the process, future commissions should be afforded additional time for deliberation. Additionally, the Council recognizes the potential issues associated with increased compensation levels going into effect during the term in which such changes in compensation are approved. The 2015 Quadrennial Advisory Commission determined that its recommended salary increases should take effect as of January 1, 2016, but also suggested that the Council consider changing the timing of future commissions to later in the Council session. Amending the timing of when a commission is appointed will afford future commissions greater flexibility to consider - and make it more likely that they will recommend - that increases in compensation go into effect in the session after which they are voted on and approved.\n      � 2. Subdivision a of section 3-601 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law 77 for the year 1986, is amended to read as follows:\n      a. Between the first and fifteenth day of January, [nineteen hundred eighty-seven] 2020, and during the same period every fourth year thereafter, the mayor shall appoint three persons for the review of compensation levels of elected officials. The members of the commission shall be private citizens generally recognized for their knowledge and experience in management and compensation matters. The mayor shall appoint one of the members to be chairperson of the commission.\n      � 3. Subdivision c of section 3-601 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law 77 for the year 1986, is amended to read as follows:\n      c. The commission shall submit a report to the mayor [on or before the March fifteenth] not later than one hundred twenty days following its appointment containing its recommendations for changes in compensation levels for any elected position set forth in subdivision b or its recommendation that no changes are warranted.\n      � 4.
