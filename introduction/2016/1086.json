  "Summary": "This bill would require the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA) to establish and engage in outreach and educational efforts around consumer protection issues relevant to individuals sixty years of age and older. This outreach would include information about such issues as telemarketing and internet fraud, Social Security, Medicare and healthcare fraud, reverse mortgage products, and investment schemes. DCA would be required to post this information on its website and provide it to the Department for the Aging (DFTA). The bill would further require DFTA to ensure that materials created as part of this initiative are made available at all senior centers and naturally occurring retirement communities in the city.",
