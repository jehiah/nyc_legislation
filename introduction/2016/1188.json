  "Summary": "Currently, when the Banking Commission recommends an interest rate for the non-payment of water and sewer rents to the Council, the Banking Commission must propose a rate at least six percent greater than the prevailing interest rate charged for commercial loans extended to prime borrowers by commercial banks operating in the City. This legislation would change that requirement to allow the Banking Commission to propose a rate that is at least equal to such prevailing interest rate.",
