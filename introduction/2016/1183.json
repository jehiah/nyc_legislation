  "Summary": "This bill requires the New York City Police Department to create a report when a person who is arrested is treated at a hospital while under arrest. These reports must be promptly sent to the Department of Health and Mental Health (“DOHMH”) if the arrested person is taken into the custody of the Department of Correction (“DOC”).\r\n\r\nThe bill also requires the DOHMH or its designee to screen every person scheduled for arraignment in a criminal court for possible medical or mental health issues, and to make reports of such screenings available to healthcare providers operating on inmates in DOC custody. The bill also requires the DOHMH to establish procedures to obtain medical records from inmates created while such inmates were in police custody.",
