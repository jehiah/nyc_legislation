  "Summary": "This bill would amend Local Law 67 of 2008, governing participation of minority-and women-owned business enterprises (M/WBEs) in construction projects receiving benefits under the Industrial and Commercial Abatement (ICAP) program. It would: 1) lower the project cost threshold requiring ICAP applicants to directly solicit M/WBEs to work on the project from $1.5 million to $750,000; 2) require applicants to inform the Department of Small Business Services (SBS) after it has received a final ICAP award of contracting and subcontracting opportunities at the applicable site as they arise; and 3) require all applicants to submit certifications of compliance with M/WBE program requirements to SBS, in addition to the Department of Finance, along with the final application for benefits.",
