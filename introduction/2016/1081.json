  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department for the Aging (DFTA) to develop and conduct a survey, no later than February 15, 2017, of unpaid caregivers and service providers to assess existing unpaid caregiver services and identify the needs of unpaid caregivers. Next, it would require DFTA to deliver to the Mayor and Council, and publish on its website, a comprehensive plan with recommendations to address the needs of New York City’s unpaid caregivers by August 30, 2017. In the development of the plan, DFTA would be required to consult with the Human Resources Administration, the Mayor’s Office for People with Disabilities, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, and other agencies, as well as unpaid caregivers, academic experts in caregiver issues, service providers, and advocates for senior citizens and individuals with disabilities. Finally, DFTA would be required to submit to the Mayor and the Speaker, two years after the submission of the original plan and every five years after, a report detailing progress made on the recommendations resulting from the plan.",
