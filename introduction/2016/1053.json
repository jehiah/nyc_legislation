  "Summary": "This bill would require companies that perform elevator and escalator maintenance, repair and replacement to designate a person in responsible charge of those companies’ elevator-related operations, and would require (1) elevator maintenance companies and company directors to be licensed by the Department of Buildings (DOB), (2) elevator maintenance company mechanics to demonstrate their qualifications based on experience or certification, and (3) elevator maintenance company helpers to demonstrate enrollment in a vocational, trade or apprenticeship program. The bill would include initial training and continuing education requirements and would be phased in over time, with full compliance required by January 1, 2021. The bill would also give DOB the power to set licensing fees and would exempt DOB from the licensing and training requirements.",
