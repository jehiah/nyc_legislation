  "Summary": "This bill would create a definition of privately owned public spaces (POPS) that includes POPS established pursuant to the Zoning Resolution in exchange for floor area bonuses in private developments, POPS listed in the POPS data set available through the City’s open data portal, and POPS established pursuant to discretionary actions and approvals (such as special permits, variances, and certifications) rendered on or after January 1, 2001. \r\n\r\nThe bill would require the Department of City Planning to report to the Council and make available on a publicly available website information about POPS, including their locations, the required amenities, and operating requirements.  It would require an agency designated by the Mayor to inspect POPS on a regular basis, and to report annually on enforcement actions taken against non-compliant building owners.  The bill would also require all covered POPS to display signage including hours of operation and required amenities.",
