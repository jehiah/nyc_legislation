Disposal includes transfers of equipment between agencies when such equipment contains sensitive or confidential information that is not relevant to the work of the agency receiving the equipment. City agencies, and third party contractors obligated to dispose of such equipment, must also certify that they have complied with the law.","TextID":58913,"Text":"Int.
