  "Summary": "This bill would require any agency disposing of electronic equipment that contains a data storage device, including printers, copiers and computers, to fully erase such device before its disposal. Disposal includes transfers of equipment between agencies when such equipment contains sensitive or confidential information that is not relevant to the work of the agency receiving the equipment. City agencies, and third party contractors obligated to dispose of such equipment, must also certify that they have complied with the law.",

Chapter 5 of title 10 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 10-504 to read as follows:\n      � 10-504 Agency disposal of electronics. a. Any agency that disposes of electronic equipment that contains a hard disk drive, solid state drive or similar device capable of storing information while powered off, including but not limited to printers, copiers and computers, shall ensure, before its disposal, the erasure of all information contained therein, either through degaussing, physical destruction of the drive, a data wiping that includes at least two full overwrites or another erasure method specified by the department of information technology and telecommunications after consultation with all relevant agencies. This requirement shall not apply to boot related firmware.\n      b.
