  "TextID": 56645,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Title 19 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 19-167.4 to read as follows:\n      � 19-167.4 Suspending the activation of parking meters during inclement weather. No person parking a vehicle at a parking meter or a muni-meter is required to activate such meter on any day that the mayor has declared the city's public schools closed because of inclement weather. Where a notice of violation is issued to an owner or operator of a vehicle for the failure to activate a parking meter or a muni-meter, it is an affirmative defense to such violation that the city's public schools were declared to be closed because of inclement weather. For the purposes of this section, the term \"muni-meter\" means an electronic parking meter that dispenses timed receipts that must be displayed in a conspicuous place on a vehicle's dashboard.\n      � 2. This local law takes effect immediately.\n        \n\n\nwjp\nLS # 4019\n09/08/15; 10:30am",
