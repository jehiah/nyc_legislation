  "Summary": "Laundries in the City are licensed by the Department of Consumer Affairs (“DCA”). The current licensing scheme dates from the early 20th Century and certain activities are not properly regulated. This bill would update the City’s laundry licensing law to better regulate the industry as it operates today. The bill would create a tiered licensing scheme to capture three distinct activities: retail laundry, industrial laundry and industrial laundry delivery. This bill would create additional requirements related to cleanliness and hygiene for industrial laundries and industrial laundry delivery services. Industrial laundries would be required to implement procedures to ensure that all laundry is hygienically cleaned and, businesses engaged in industrial laundry delivery would be required to implement procedures to ensure separation of clean and dirty laundry in order to maintain cleanliness. Finally, this bill would create a task force to review the industry and the enforcement of the law and make any recommendations to the Council and the Mayor.",
