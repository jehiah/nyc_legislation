  "Summary": "The New York City Human Rights Law (“HRL”) bars real estate brokers and salespeople from lying about the availability of housing, land, or commercial space for a discriminatory reason, a protection sometimes called a “right to truthful information.” This bill would broaden or incorporate a right to truthful information for a variety of activity covered by the HRL, including: the availability and terms and conditions of sale or lease for housing, land, or commercial space; admission to or membership in a Multiple Listing Service or similar organizations; lending; employment; and access to public accommodations, which include many providers of goods and services, including restaurants, stores, and even some government entities.  \r\n\r\nThis bill would also give principals and employers a cause of action when their rights are violated by discrimination against their agents or employees, as long as the discrimination happened while the agent or employee was working for the principal or employer.",
