  "Summary": "The New York City Human Rights Law (“HRL”) bars real estate brokers and salespeople from lying about the availability of housing, land, or commercial space for a discriminatory reason, a protection sometimes called a “right to truthful information.” This bill would broaden or incorporate a right to truthful information for a variety of activity covered by the HRL, including: the availability and terms and conditions of sale or lease for housing, land, or commercial space; admission to or membership in a Multiple Listing Service or similar organizations; lending; employment; and access to public accommodations, which include many providers of goods and services, including restaurants, stores, and even some government entities.  \r\n\r\nThis bill would also give principals and employers a cause of action when their rights are violated by discrimination against their agents or employees, as long as the discrimination happened while the agent or employee was working for the principal or employer.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection 1. Subdivision 17 of section 8-102 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 39 for the year 1991, is amended to read as follows:\n\t17. The term \"covered entity\" means a person required to comply with any provision of [section]sections 8-107 or 8-107.1 of this chapter.\n\t� 2. Section 8-102 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new subdivision 32 to read as follows:\n\t32. a. The term \"person aggrieved,\" except as used in section 8-123, includes a person whose right created, granted or protected by this chapter is violated by a covered entity directly or through conduct of the covered entity to which the person's agent or employee is subjected while the agent or employee was acting, or as a result of the agent or employee having acted, within the scope of the agency or employment relationship. For purposes of this subdivision, an agent or employee's protected status is imputed to that person's principal or employer when the agent or employee acts within the scope of the agency or employment relationship.
