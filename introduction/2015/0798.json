  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Finance to include a notice regarding legal and preferential rents on certain documents related to the NYC Rent Freeze Program. Specifically, the notice must include the rent amount on which the benefit calculation was based, an explanation of why that amount was used in the calculation, the legal regulated rent, an explanation that the tenant may continue to pay a preferential rent even once enrolled in the program, a statement that the tenant can obtain a rent registration history and file a complaint with the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, and a telephone number and email address for that agency.\r\n\r\nIn addition, by 2018, the legislation would require the Department of Finance to include both the preferential and legal regulated rents of applicants to the NYC Rent Freeze Program in its database and include the preferential rent amount in the notice described above.",
