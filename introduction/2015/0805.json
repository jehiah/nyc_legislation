This bill amends that law in two key ways. First, this bill adds three types of people to the list of those who cannot discriminate: anyone who buys or sells a franchise and anyone who leases space to a provider of public accommodations. Second, the bill declares that it is illegal to offer a person who is or is perceived to be a member of a protected class the same benefits, services, or privileges as everyone else, but in such a way that they do not receive “the full and equal enjoyment” of those benefits on “equal terms and conditions,” or to use discriminatory advertisements and public statements. The bill will also make additional minor or technical corrections to the existing law.","TextID":57401,"Text":"Int.
