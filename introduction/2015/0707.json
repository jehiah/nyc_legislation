Specifically, they are prohibited from acting as an agent for a lender and from advertising, promoting or otherwise arranging for the services of a lender. \r\n\r\nThis bill would remove the prohibition on advertising, promoting or otherwise arranging for the services of a lender but would maintain the prohibition on acting as the agent of a lender and prohibit the advertising or promoting of a single lender.","TextID":55373,"Text":"Int.
