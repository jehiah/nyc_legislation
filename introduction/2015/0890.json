  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Information Technology & Telecommunications (DoITT) to preserve row data that is subject to permanent removal or replacement.

Subdivision c of section 23-502 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 11 for the year 2012, is amended to read as follows: \n      c.  Such public data sets shall be updated as often as is necessary to preserve the integrity and usefulness of the data sets to the extent that the agency regularly maintains or updates the public data set. The department shall preserve row data that is subject to permanent removal or replacement and shall create and preserve archival copies, or an archival compilation data set with data indexed to its time of preservation, of public data sets in accordance with the technical standards manual published by the department pursuant to section 23-505. \n      � 2. Subdivision a of section 23-505 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 11 for the year 2012,  is amended to read as follows:\n      a. Within one hundred eighty days of the effective date of this chapter, the department shall prepare and publish a technical standards manual for the publishing of public data sets in raw or unprocessed form through a single web portal by city agencies for the purpose of making public data available to the greatest number of users and for the greatest number of applications and shall, whenever practicable, use open standards for web publishing and e-government. Such manual shall identify the reasons why each technical standard was selected and for which types of data it is applicable and may recommend or require that data be published in more than one technical standard. The manual shall include a plan to adopt or utilize a web application programming interface that permits application programs to request and receive public data sets directly from the web portal. The manual shall also include guidelines for the division of large data sets into groups of smaller data sets, disaggregated by discrete time units, when technical barriers, archival necessity or practical concerns require such division. Such manual shall be updated by the department as necessary.\n      � 3. This local law takes effect one year after it becomes law.\n\nBJR\nLS #3888\n11/16/15  6:08PM\n\n1",
