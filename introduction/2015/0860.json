  "Summary": "The bill would limit the number of commuter van licenses to 735, provided that the Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) could increase the number of available licenses upon a finding that there is a need for additional vans in an annual study. In such study, the TLC would review safety in the commuter van industry, in addition to the demand for commuter van service.",
