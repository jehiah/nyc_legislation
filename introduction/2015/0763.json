  "Summary": "The Department of Correction is currently required to report on a broad array of violence statistics for adolescent inmates. This bill repeals that law and replaces it with an expanded reporting requirement that includes adult inmates. The Department must report on 7 violence-related statistics monthly, an additional 16 statistics quarterly, and an additional 4 statistics yearly. This report will also separate reporting for inmates aged 16-17, 18-21, and 22 years old or older.",
