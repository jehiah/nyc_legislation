  "TextID": 57185,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Title 21-A of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 21-966 to read as follows:\n      \n      �21-966  Reporting on health education.\n      a. For the purposes of this section, the following term has the following meaning:\n      Health education. The term \"health education\" means health education instruction, including sexual health education and HIV/AIDS education, consistent with learning standards for health education found in regulations promulgated by the New York state commissioner of education and in the department's requirements.\n      b. Not later than December 1, 2016, and on or before the December 1 annually thereafter, the department shall submit to the speaker and post conspicuously on the department's website in a manner searchable by individual school, a report for the preceding academic year for each community school district and school within such district, which shall include, but not be limited to the following:\n       1. The total number and percentage of students in grades six through twelve who have completed at least one semester of health education.\n      2. Starting in the report for the 2017-2018 school year and for every subsequent school year thereafter, the total number and percentage of students in grade six who have completed at least 5 lessons in HIV/AIDS education;\n      3. Starting in the report for the 2017-2018 school year and for every subsequent school year thereafter, the total number and percentage of students in grades seven through twelve who have completed at least 6 lessons in HIV/AIDS education;\n      4. Information regarding the implementation of health education instruction including, but not limited to: (i) how the department tracks compliance with health education and HIV/AIDS education requirements; (ii) how principals monitor teacher compliance with the sexual health knowledge benchmarks as outlined by the department and, and (iii) how the efficacy of the health education curriculum is evaluated;\n      5. Information regarding health education which specifically addresses lesbian, gay, bisexual,  transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) students, and other non-heterosexual sexual orientations or non-cisgender gender identities, including but not limited to, sexual health knowledge for same-sex relationships;   \n      c. All information required to be reported by this section shall be aggregated citywide, as\nwell as disaggregated by city council district, community school district and school.\n      d.  No information that is otherwise required to be reported pursuant to this section shall be reported in a manner that would violate any applicable provision of federal, state or local law relating to the privacy of student information or that would interfere with law enforcement investigations or otherwise conflict with the interests of law enforcement. If a category contains between 0 and 9 students, or allows another category to be narrowed to between 0 and 9 students, the number shall be replaced with a symbol.\n      �2.
