The subdivision to be repealed provides that the HRL should not be construed to (a) restrict an employer’s right to insist than an employee meet bona-fide job qualifications; (b) authorize or require affirmative action on the basis of sexual orientation; (c) limit or override any exemptions from the provisions of the HRL; (d) make lawful any act that violates the New York Penal Law; or (e) “[e]ndorse any particular behavior or way of life.”","TextID":56206,"Text":"Int.
