  "Summary": "This bill would repeal Administrative Code § 8-107(16), which addresses how the New York City Human Rights Law’s (HRL) protections against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation should be construed. The subdivision to be repealed provides that the HRL should not be construed to (a) restrict an employer’s right to insist than an employee meet bona-fide job qualifications; (b) authorize or require affirmative action on the basis of sexual orientation; (c) limit or override any exemptions from the provisions of the HRL; (d) make lawful any act that violates the New York Penal Law; or (e) “[e]ndorse any particular behavior or way of life.”",
