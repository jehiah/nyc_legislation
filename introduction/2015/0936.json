The bill would also require that DOB perform inspections to ensure that sites are complying with their applicable tenant protection plans.",

Construction documents for alterations of buildings in which any dwelling unit will be occupied during construction shall include a tenant protection plan. Such plan shall contain a statement that the building contains dwelling units that will be occupied during construction and shall indicate in sufficient detail the specific units that are or may be occupied during construction, the means and methods to be employed to safeguard the safety and health of the occupants throughout the construction, including, where applicable, details such as temporary fire-rated assemblies, opening protectives, or dust containment procedures. Such means and methods shall be described with particularity and in no case shall terms such as \"code compliant,\" \"approved,\" \"legal,\" \"protected in accordance with law\" or similar terms be used as a substitute for such description. The elements of the tenant protection plan may vary depending on the nature and scope of the work but at a minimum shall make detailed and specific provisions for:\n\n1. Egress. At all times in the course of construction provision shall be made for adequate egress as required by this code and the tenant protection plan shall identify the egress that will be provided.

Maintaining essential services. Where heat, hot water, cold water, gas, electricity, or other utility services are provided in such building or in any dwelling unit located therein, the tenant protection plan shall specify the means and methods to be used for maintaining such services during such work in accordance with the requirements of the New York city housing maintenance code. If a disruption of any such service is anticipated during the work, then such plan shall specify the anticipated duration of such disruption and the means and methods to be employed to minimize such disruption, including the provision of sufficient alternatives for such service during such disruption.\n\n� 28-104.8.4.1 Public availability of tenant protection plan. Upon issuance of a permit for work containing a tenant protection plan, the department shall make the tenant protection plan publicly available on its website.\n\n� 28-104.8.4.2 Provision of copy of tenant protection plan to occupants upon request.

A statement that occupants of the building may call 311 to make complaints about the work.\n\n      � 2.

For buildings undergoing work for which a tenant protection plan is required by section 28-104.8.4 of the administrative code, inspections shall be made by the department to determine compliance with the tenant protection plan.\n \n      � 3.

In buildings containing occupied dwelling units, including newly constructed buildings that are partially occupied where work is still ongoing within the building, all construction or demolition work shall be performed in accordance with a tenant protection plan as required by Chapter 1 of Title 28 of the Administrative Code.\n \n3303.10.2 Inspections of tenant protection plan. The owner shall notify the department in writing at least 72 hours prior to the commencement of any work requiring a tenant protection plan. The department shall conduct an inspection of five percent of such sites within seven days after the commencement of such work to verify compliance with the tenant protection plan.

If work is not being performed in accordance with the tenant protection plan, the commissioner may issue a stop work order pursuant to section 28-207.2 of the administrative code.\n\n      � 5. This local law takes effect 120 days after it becomes law, except that this local law shall not apply to applications for construction document approval filed before such effective date or to work related thereto, and except that the commissioner of buildings may take such measures as are necessary for its implementation, including the promulgation of rules, prior to such effective date.\n\nFM/GP\nLS #2731\n8/1/17 6:15 PM\n",
