  "Summary": "This bill would require owners of cooling towers to register such towers with the Department of Buildings and develop a plan for maintaining such towers. It would also require cooling towers to be inspected and tested on a quarterly basis. If any test comes back positive for microbes, such as the bacteria that cause Legionnaires’ Disease, then the owner would have to clean and disinfect the system in accordance with Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) regulations. Finally, this bill would require DOHMH to report to the Council on the implementation of this law.",
