  "Summary": "Int. 656 would establish the South Shore BID on Staten Island in Council Member Ignizio’s district. This BID would consist of three, small, non-contiguous commercial strips located in the towns of Great Kills, Eltingville and Annadale. This is an interesting BID because it would be the City’s first BID consisting of three separate commercial strips under the umbrella of one BID. The BID would be comprised of 217 parcels of land containing 275 businesses, most of which are independently-owned and some of which are regional and national chain stores. The majority of the BID is commercial, but there are also public facilities, transportation and utilities, vacant land, and 82 residential units.\r\n\r\nThe BID would have a relatively small budget of $185,000 in its first year, with the average assessment being approximately $1,002 per year and the maximum projected assessment being $5,090 per year.",
