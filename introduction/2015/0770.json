  "Summary": "This bill requires the Department of Correction to work in conjunction with the Department of Health and Mental Health to develop a “crisis intervention program.” This program would be designed to address situations in which inmates with mental health issues act out, typically by refusing to leave their cells or disobeying correction officers. The program would create protocols to address these issues. The bill also requires the Department of Correction to provide specialized training in how to address such situations, and to create a policy of addressing these situations with teams of officers with such training. These teams would also be required to include one civilian associated with the Department of Health and Mental Health who has received specialized training on addressing these situations. The Departments of Correction and Health and Mental Health must meet at least yearly to address issues with the crisis intervention program.\r\n\r\nThe bill also requires the Department of Correction to report yearly on the status of this program, including the number of officers who have received crisis intervention training, the number of crisis intervention teams utilized by the department, and the number of crisis situations involving inmates with mental health issues were addressed with such teams.",
