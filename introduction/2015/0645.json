  "Summary": "Motorists in New York City are prohibited from using dedicated bus lanes unless they are making right turns or picking up or dropping off passengers. The City operates cameras from 7:00am to 7:00pm on weekdays to monitor proper use of such lanes and impose monetary liability on those who fail to comply with bus lane restrictions. The bill would provide a “grace period” during the first and last five-minute period of such restrictions wherein motorists would not be subject to penalties resulting from images captured by a camera for utilizing bus lanes.",
