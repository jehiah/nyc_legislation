The City operates cameras from 7:00am to 7:00pm on weekdays to monitor proper use of such lanes and impose monetary liability on those who fail to comply with bus lane restrictions. The bill would provide a “grace period” during the first and last five-minute period of such restrictions wherein motorists would not be subject to penalties resulting from images captured by a camera for utilizing bus lanes.","TextID":55483,"Text":"Int.
