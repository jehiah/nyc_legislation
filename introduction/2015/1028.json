  "Summary": "This bill would create a sexual education task force. The task force would be comprised of a minimum of nine members, including at least three experts in sexual health education, at least one teacher from a New York City (NYC) public school, at least one staff person from an NYC public school who is not a teacher (such as a guidance counselor or social worker), at least two high school students, at least one expert in the field of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning and gender non-conforming health education, and at least one representative from the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Members will be appointed by the Mayor after consultation with the Speaker of the Council. The task force would be responsible for reviewing information about the current recommended sexual health education curricula and the implementation of sexual health education in NYC public schools, as well as issuing a report with findings and recommendations for the improvement and expansion of the curricula and implementation in grades kindergarten through twelve. The task force, in conducting its review, would provide an opportunity for students and parents to provide comments and feedback. The task force would be required to submit a report to the Mayor and the Speaker by December 1, 2017 with its findings and recommendations, and may subsequently make ongoing findings and recommendations as deemed necessary by the task force.",
