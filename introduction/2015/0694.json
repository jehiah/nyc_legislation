  "Summary": "In 2010, the City released a report estimating that by 2030, 44 percent of the City’s greenhouse gas emissions will come from the transportation sector. The report recommended the City encourage use of electric vehicles (EVs) to help reduce emissions, improve air quality, and save drivers money on fuel and maintenance. In 2013, the Council passed a local law requiring that 20 percent of parking spaces in new parking garages and open parking lots be capable of supporting EV charging stations. Existing lots were also required expand EV charging capabilities as they upgrade their electrical capacities. \r\n\r\nUnder the proposed local law, 40 percent of parking spaces in new parking garages and open parking lots must be capable of supporting EV charging stations by January 1, 2030. Existing lots would also be required to expand EV charging capabilities as they upgrade their electrical capacities.",
