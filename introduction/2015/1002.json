  "Summary": "This bill would require the Conflicts of Interest Board to maintain records of compliance with the annual conflicts of interest law for candidates who participate in the City’s public matching campaign finance program. Such records would be provided to the Campaign Finance Board upon request. This system would replace the current system, in which candidates are required to obtain a receipt of compliance from the Conflicts of Interest Board, and to provide such receipt to the Campaign Finance Board.",
