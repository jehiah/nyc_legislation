Such records would be provided to the Campaign Finance Board upon request. This system would replace the current system, in which candidates are required to obtain a receipt of compliance from the Conflicts of Interest Board, and to provide such receipt to the Campaign Finance Board.","TextID":58781,"Text":"Int.
