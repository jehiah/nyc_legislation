  "Summary": "Under the bill, the City would be responsible for the upkeep and liability for sidewalks outside of buildings owned or used exclusively by nonprofit organizations. While the City has shifted responsibility to property owners for sidewalk maintenance, this bill would return to the City responsibility for those sidewalks abutting properties owned or exclusively used by a nonprofit organization.",
