  "Summary": "This bill would require the Commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development (“HPD”) to provide a system that would allow individuals to submit, online and by telephone, complaints about housing conditions and to make information relating to such complaints publicly available online. In addition, where the Commissioner has delegated HPD’s enforcement duties to another entity, this bill provides that the Commissioner may delegate the above duties to such entity. Finally, this bill would require the Commissioner to report on the terms of such delegation.",
