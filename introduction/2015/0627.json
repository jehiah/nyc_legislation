  "Summary": "This bill would require each city agency that collects personal information to develop a system to protect the privacy of that information. The system of protection would include appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality of personal records and would also require the destruction of those records once the purpose of collecting that information is achieved.",
