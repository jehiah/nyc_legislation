  "Summary": "Section 10-102 of the New York city Administrative Code regulates the use of radio receiving sets that can receive signals on police frequencies. This bill would amend section 10-102 to prohibit the public use of any portable device for the purposes of receiving or transmitting signals on police or fire department frequencies. This bill would define portable devices to include radio receiving and transmitting sets, cellular phones, tablets and other mobile devices equipped with electronic applications that enable the user to transmit, receive or translate signals, received on frequencies allocated to the police or fire department. The bill would exempt police or peace officers acting under official capacity, individuals with a valid permit issued by the Police Commissioner, and individuals with an Armature Radio Operator’s License issued by the Federal Communications Commission. The proposed legislation would increase the current fine of twenty-five dollars to five hundred dollars.",
