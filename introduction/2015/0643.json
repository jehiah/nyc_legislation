The commissioner shall post a report every 60 days, on the department of correction website, setting forth the number of city jail inmates who have been found guilty of violating departmental rules but have yet to be placed in punitive segregation, restrictive housing or a clinical alternative to punitive segregation housing, or any successor to such housing units, disaggregated by inmates with \"M\" designations at the end of their book and case numbers, indicating that the inmates are known to mental health staff, and inmates without \"M\" designations. Such report shall state the number of inmates awaiting placement in any such housing unit categorized by the length of time such inmates have been awaiting placement in the following categories: 1-5 days, 6-15 days, 16-30 days, 31-60 days, and 61 days or longer.
