  "Summary": "This bill would first require the New York City Economic Development Corporation (EDC) to assess and evaluate entities (by August 1 of each year, beginning 2017) to which it provided a loan, grant or tax benefit greater than $150,000, or who are involved with the sale or lease of city-owned land for a project expected to retain or create at least 25 jobs, to determine whether they met the M/WBE goals, if applicable, on the particular project. EDC would then submit this information to the Department of Small Business Services (SBS) (by November 1 of each year, beginning 2017). SBS would be required to submit an annual report (by January 1 of each year, with the first report due January 30, 2018) to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council containing information including: (i) a list of all recipients of economic development benefits; (ii) the M/WBE goals for these recipients; (iii) whether the recipient conducted a good faith effort to identify and utilize M/WBEs to achieve such goals; and (iv) if M/WBE contracting goals were not met by a recipient, a description of the reasons the goals were not met.",
