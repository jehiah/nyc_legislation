  "Summary": "Curb extensions prohibit parking near crosswalks at an intersection, increasing pedestrian visibility. Under the bill, the City would be required to identify intersections that pose the greatest danger to pedestrians, based upon incidence of traffic crashes involving pedestrians, and implement curb extensions prohibiting parking within 15 feet of a crosswalk in at least five such intersections in each borough per year.",
