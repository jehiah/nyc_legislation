  "Summary": "The Department of Correction operates a grievance system in which inmates may file formal complaints regarding the conditions of incarceration, pursuant to state mandates. This system has multiple levels of review, from the initial filing of the grievance through multiple phases of review and appeal. Grievances may be filed through a grievance office or through a box in which grievance forms may be deposited. \r\n\r\nThis bill requires the Department to report on the number of grievances filed at every step of the grievance process, and the outcome of such grievances at each state of the grievance system. The bill also requires the Department to list separately the system’s functioning in those facilities in which grievance offices or grievance form deposit boxes are not available, and to list separately whether grievances are filed through the grievance office, the grievance form drop box, or through grievance program staff members.",
