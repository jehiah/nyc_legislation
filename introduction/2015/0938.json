  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Buildings (DOB) to compile and maintain a watch list of contractors who have been found to have performed work without a required permit in the preceding two years. The bill would also require DOB to engage in increased oversight of any worksite where a contractor included on the watch list performs work. The bill also would provide a timeline under which a contractor could be removed from the watch list.",
