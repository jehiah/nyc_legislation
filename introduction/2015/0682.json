  "Summary": "There have recently been several reported incidents of building owners hiring tenant relocation specialists to try to convince tenants, many of whom are rent-regulated, to leave their apartments. This bill would create a licensing scheme for tenant relocation specialists and agencies which would require applicants to pass an exam, furnish a surety bond, pay a licensing fee and make initial contact with tenants in writing.  It would also bar licensees from harassing tenants or providing false information to tenants.  Finally, this bill would require the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer Affairs to provide an annual report to the Mayor and the Council on the implementation of this law.",
  "TextID": 56541,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n      Section 1.  Declaration of legislative intent and findings. a. The council finds and declares that:\n\t1. Although there are legitimate reasons for building owners to offer tenants money or other valuable consideration to vacate their apartments, in recent years, and due in part to rapidly increasing rents, some owners have engaged in abusive and intimidating behaviors to coerce such tenants into accepting these buyout offers and leaving their homes; and\n\t2. The rights of building owners to make these buyout offers must be balanced with the rights of tenants to negotiate or refuse such offers and to be free of harassment.\n\tb. As a result, it is necessary and appropriate to place reasonable time, place and manner restrictions on the making of these buyout offers in order to protect tenants from harassment while still allowing owners and tenants to engage in negotiations over such offers. \n      � 2.
