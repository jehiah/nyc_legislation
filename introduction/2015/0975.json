The penalty for violation is a fine of $250 to $500 and/or imprisonment of up to 10 days. The bill would raise the fine for failure to remove a utility pole when required to $350 to $750 and provide that a person in violation may also be subject to civil penalties of $100 per day that they are in violation of the Code.",
