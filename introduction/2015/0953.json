  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation (“DOT”) to provide written notice of proposed bus route changes to affected members of the community. Specifically, this legislation requires that, within 30 days of a bus route change being proposed, DOT must provide written notification of the proposed change to all owners and residents of buildings or dwellings located along the new bus route, except that the notice requirement does not apply to bus route changes that must be implemented immediately to preserve public health or safety.  The bill also sets forth the information that must be included in each written notification.",
