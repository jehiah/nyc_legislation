  "Summary": "This bill would update existing requirements for customer service training given to inspectors at agencies that interact regularly with small businesses. Specifically, it would require that this customer service training be reviewed annually, and updated as necessary, based on customer service survey feedback received through the City’s website. This survey is currently operational, and its continued operation would be required by this bill. Inspected businesses are directed to this customer service survey when they are handed a “Business Owners Bill of Rights,” which is required to be distributed during inspections. The bill would further require that, if fewer than 500 survey responses are received during designated two-year periods, the Office of Operations would be required to conduct outreach until that number is met for up to three months.",
  "TextID": 56184,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\tSection 1. Paragraph 1 of subdivision f of section 15 of the New York city charter, as amended by local law number 132 for the year 2013, is amended to read as follows:\n      1. The office of operations shall develop a business owner's bill of rights. The bill of rights shall be in the form of a written document, drafted in plain language, that advises business owners of their rights as they relate to agency inspections.
