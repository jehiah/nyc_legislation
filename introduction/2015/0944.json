Article 213 of title 28 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding new sections 28-213.6 and 28-213.7 to read as follows:\n� 28-213.6 Enhanced penalties for other violations.

This local law takes effect one year after it becomes law, except that the commissioner of buildings may take such actions as are necessary for its implementation, including the promulgation of rules, before such effective date.\n\nGP\nLS #3203/2014, 3473/2014, 3529/2014\n8/1/17 7:53 PM\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n11",
