  "Summary": "State law requires that children born while their mothers are in city jails be housed with their mothers during their first year, with some exceptions. This bill creates procedures the Department of Correction must follow in determining when these exceptions apply, requires all female inmates to be informed of these housing options, and requires a yearly report on the use of this housing.",
