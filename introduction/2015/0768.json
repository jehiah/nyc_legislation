  "Summary": "The Department of Correction is currently required to report on certain conditions in their punitive segregation facilities and other specialized facilities in which inmates are punished for committing certain infractions while in custody. This bill expands the list of facilities for which such reporting is required, adding any facility in which inmates are regularly kept to their cells for more than the maximum number of hours allowed by the jail standards, regardless of whether such placement is due to a punishment for committing an infraction or not. This would mean that the Department’s new Enhanced Supervision Housing would be included in this reporting requirement.",
