  "Summary": "Section §14-150 of  New York’s Administrative Code, requires the New York City Police Department to provide to the Council various statistical criteria relating to the operation of the NYPD.  Paragraph (4) in particular, requests the total number of arrests, crime complaints, arrests, summons activity, domestic violence radio runs and felony complaints for properties under the jurisdiction of the department of parks and recreation.  Each of these requests requires a further breakdown in areas such as level of crime, precinct where crime occurred, transit district and other useful categories that assist in providing the council with a more detailed understanding of the requested information.    This amendment would require the NYPD to report on the number of voided arrests as well as the number of arrest which were declined by the local prosecutor providing a broader picture of NYPD statistics.",
