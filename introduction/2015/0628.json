  "Summary": "Under Section 3-209 of the City’s Administrative Code, high schools must make voter registration materials available to students during the year and must provide postage-paid voter registration materials to graduating seniors. This bill would require the city Department of Education to ask for, and the city Board of Elections to provide, registration materials in any available language (as determined by state or federal requirements) that makes sense for a particular school’s student population. The city Board of Elections also must code its registration forms so that it can track which forms come back from each school district. The bill also would require both the city Department of Education and the city Board of Elections to help track and report on whether these student voter registration efforts are effective in getting young adults to register to vote.",
