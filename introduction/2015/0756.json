  "Summary": "Currently, the Administrative Code requires the New York City Department of Transportation (DOT) to inspect locations where four or more serious injuries or fatalities of cyclists or pedestrians occurred and to make results of such inspections available to the public upon request. Under the bill, DOT would be required to submit such results to the relevant Council Member and Community Board. The bill would also require that DOT accelerate the timeframe in which it conducts comprehensive studies of pedestrian fatalities and serious injuries from every five years to every three years. Additionally, such studies would be required to be submitted to Community Boards.",
