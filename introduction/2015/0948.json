  "Summary": "This bill would repeal section 3-112 that requires the New York City Police Department (NYPD) to provide some domestic violence and hate crime statistics and consolidate the reporting requirement within section 14-161 of the Administrative Code.  The bill would require the NYPD to report on the department website the number of domestic violence radio runs, domestic violence related rapes and felonious assaults on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis.  In addition, the bill will require the department to report the number of domestic violence crimes on NYCHA property to be reported on a bi-annual basis and homicides related to domestic violence, hate crimes, and felony assaults determined to be hate crimes to be reported on a quarterly and annual basis.",
