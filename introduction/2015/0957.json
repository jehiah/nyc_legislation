  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Education (the “DOE”) to submit on an annual basis to the Council, and post on its website, information regarding sexual health education instruction received by public middle and high school instructors. The DOE would be required to provide information on the total number of full-time and part-time instructors teaching health, total number and percentage of full-time and part-time health instructors who have received a certification in sexual health education, the total number and percentage of full-time and part-time instructors who received professional development training provided by the DOE on sexual health education in the prior school year, and the total number and percentage of full-time and part-time instructors who attended multiple sexual health education professional development training sessions provided by the DOE, disaggregated by the number of trainings attended. All of this data will be disaggregated by instructors in grades 6-8 and grades 9-12, as well as by Council District, Community School District, and school. \r\n\r\nThe DOE would have to provide this data to the Council and post it on its website by February 15, 2016, and thereafter by February 15th of each year.",
