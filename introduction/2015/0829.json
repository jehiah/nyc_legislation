Each center is required to be located in an area easily accessible and in close proximity to public transportation. The Veteran Resource Centers would provide veterans with free, current information on the matters described above, as well as housing, public and private social services, and financial assistance and tax exemptions available to veterans. Additionally, MOVA would be required, beginning May 1, 2016 and every six months thereafter, to submit a report to the Mayor and Council Speaker on the number of veterans utilizing each center, the services offered by each center, those services and/or information most frequently requested by veterans at each center, the number of full and part-time staff working at each center, the amount of funding allocated to each center, and the number of complaints received by each center with a general description of such complaints.","TextID":55472,"Text":"Int.
