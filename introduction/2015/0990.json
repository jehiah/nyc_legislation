  "Summary": "Under current law, candidates for local office who choose to participate in the City’s public funds program may receive contributions from a political committee only if such committee has registered with the Campaign Finance Board, but candidates who choose not to participate in the matching program may accept contributions from political committees regardless of whether they are registered with the Campaign Finance Board. This bill would extend the prohibition on the acceptance of contributions from non-registered political committees to non-participating candidates.",
