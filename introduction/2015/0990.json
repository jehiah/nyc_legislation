  "Summary": "Under current law, candidates for local office who choose to participate in the City’s public funds program may receive contributions from a political committee only if such committee has registered with the Campaign Finance Board, but candidates who choose not to participate in the matching program may accept contributions from political committees regardless of whether they are registered with the Campaign Finance Board. This bill would extend the prohibition on the acceptance of contributions from non-registered political committees to non-participating candidates.",
  "TextID": 58779,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection 1. Section 3-707 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 48 for the year 1998, is amended to read as follows:\n      1. [Participating committees] Candidates may accept contributions from political committees that choose to register with the board, as provided in this section. The board shall issue rules providing for such registration. Such contributions may not exceed the amount applicable under paragraph (f) of subdivision one of section 3-703 [of this chapter]. The board shall regularly publish a cumulative list of political committees that have registered, including on the internet and in periodic mailings to candidates.\n      2. It is the responsibility of the [participating] candidate to determine whether he or she may accept a contribution pursuant to this section. A [participating] candidate who receives a contribution from a political committee that has not registered with the board prior to making the contribution shall either return the contribution to the contributor or pay to the fund an amount equal to the amount of the contribution, unless the political committee registers with the board within ten days after the publication of the next subsequent list of registered political committees by the board following the date the contribution is received.\n      � 2. Paragraph (b) of subdivision 2 of section 3-719 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 116 for the year 2013, is amended to read as follows:\n      (b) A non-participating candidate, and the authorized committees of such a non-participating candidate, shall only accept contributions as limited by the provisions of paragraphs (f) and (l) of subdivision one of section 3-703, [and subdivisions] subdivision 1-a of section 3-703, subdivision 1-c [and] of section 3-703, subdivision ten of section 3-703, and section 3-707 of this chapter. Notwithstanding any contribution limitations in paragraphs (f) and (h) of subdivision one of section 3-703 and subdivision 1-a of section 3-703, a non-participating candidate may contribute to his or her own nomination for election or election with his or her personal funds or property, in-kind contributions made by the candidate to his or her authorized committees with the candidate's personal funds or property, and advances or loans made by the non-participating candidate with the candidate's personal funds or property. A candidate's personal funds or property shall include his or her funds or property jointly held with his or her spouse, domestic partner, or unemancipated children.\n      � 3.
