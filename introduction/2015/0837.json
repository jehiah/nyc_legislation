  "Summary": "This bill would require the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) to publish a database online that provides information on all properties that are designated as landmarks or historic districts, or under consideration for such designation. The database would include information on items under consideration for designation, including the location of properties, the person or organization that submitted a request for consideration, relevant documents, dates of scheduled hearings or meetings and the current status of consideration. Items under consideration for designation include any properties for which the public has requested consideration, properties surveyed by commission staff, and properties calendared for consideration.",
