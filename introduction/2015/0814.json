  "Summary": "The 2005 Restoration Act provided that the New York City Human Rights Law is to be interpreted liberally and independently of similar federal or state provisions. This bill would recognize certain court cases that have given the Human Rights Law an independent construction as required by the Restoration Act. The bill also would require that exemptions and exceptions from the general provisions of the Human Rights Law be construed narrowly in order to maximize deterrence of discriminatory conduct.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Legislative findings and intent. Following the passage of local law number 85 for the year 2005, known as the Local Civil Rights Restoration Act, some judicial decisions have correctly understood and analyzed the requirement of section 8-130 of the administrative code of the city of New York that all provisions of the New York city human rights law be liberally and independently construed. The purpose of this local law is to provide additional guidance for the development of an independent body of jurisprudence for the New York city human rights law that is maximally protective of civil rights in all circumstances.\n      � 2. Section 8-130 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 85 for the year 2005, is amended to read as follows:\n      � 8-130 Construction. a. The provisions of this title shall be construed liberally for the accomplishment of the uniquely broad and remedial purposes thereof, regardless of whether federal or New York [State] state civil and human rights laws, including those laws with provisions [comparably-worded] worded comparably to provisions of this title, have been so construed. \n      b. Exceptions to and exemptions from the provisions of this title shall be construed narrowly in order to maximize deterrence of discriminatory conduct.\n      c. Cases that have correctly understood and analyzed the liberal construction requirement of subdivision a of this section and that have developed legal doctrines accordingly that reflect the broad and remedial purposes of this title include Albunio v. City of New York, 16 N.Y.3d 472 (2011), Bennett v. Health Management Systems, Inc., 92 A.D.3d 29 (1st Dep't 2011), and the majority opinion in Williams v.
