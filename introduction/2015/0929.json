The report would include the number of shelters with on-site services, a description of the health services available at intake facilities and the availability of health services to the unsheltered population. The bill would also require DHS to include in the report the most common medical health issues among adults and children in the shelter system, and the number of individuals discharged from a hospital to a shelter and a nursing home to a shelter. Every three years, the bill would require DHS to release information on the most frequent causes of hospitalizations, excluding HIV or AIDS, for homeless adults based on information available through the New York State Department of Health Statewide Planning and Research Cooperate System (SPARCS).",
