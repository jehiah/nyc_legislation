The bill would also require each covered UAV to have a tag affixed to it with an identification number linking it to its owner. The bill would authorize DOT and other actors, including the Police Department, to enforce its provisions, and would allow authorized entities to temporarily seize a UAV that was in violation of the bill and allow DOT to impose penalties on the owner or operator after a hearing.

The bill requires that, by 2020, the Administration must consult with, among others, representatives of the heating oil industry, the biodiesel industry, heating oil equipment manufacturers, and building owners and managers to conduct a survey identifying any commonly used heating oil equipment that might have a compatibility issue with using the required, higher-level biodiesel blends, and to make recommendations with respect to any such issues identified. NYCDEP will then be required to promulgate rules consistent with such recommendations, including exemptions or other special regulatory provisions for such equipment. The bill requires that, in 2023, DEP issue a report re-assessing whether there is sufficient biodiesel supply to meet the B10, B15, and B20 mandates identified in the bill. The bill expands waiver provisions already present in existing law (and adds new waiver provisions). For example, waivers would generally be available where NYCDEP determines that there is an insufficient supply of biodiesel to satisfy the relevant mandates, that the price of the required biodiesel blend significantly exceeds the price of oil, or where manufacturers of a particular boiler have noted that the boiler cannot accommodate a particular biodiesel blend without extensive modifications.","LastModified":"2018-03-26T15:51:40.19Z"}

Additionally, it would prohibit any dealer from parking, storing, or otherwise maintaining on any street a motor vehicle that is in the dealer’s possession while awaiting repair or subsequent return to the owner or lessee of such motor vehicle. Dealers in possession of motor vehicles awaiting repair or return to the owner or lessee would be required to display a placard indicating the dealer’s name, address, license number, and telephone contact information in a manner clearly legible through the motor vehicle’s forward windshield. Each violation of these prohibitions would be punishable by a fine of no less than $250 and no more than $400. Every day that a motor vehicle is parked illegally would be considered a separate violation. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the bill would allow the owner or lessee of a motor vehicle who receives a summons for a parking violation on a date and time in which the dealer was in the possession of the motor vehicle to use the dealer’s possession as an affirmative defense. If this defense is successful, the Transportation Commissioner may issue a summons, violation, or otherwise prosecute the dealer in possession at the time of the offense.\r\n\r\nThe bill would also make any motor vehicle parked upon any city street for the purpose of displaying the motor vehicle for sale or greasing or repairing such motor vehicle (except in the case of an emergency repair) subject to impoundment. Any motor vehicle impounded would not be released until all applicable towing and storage fees were paid. If a motor vehicle is impounded or receives a summons while in possession of a dealer who is not the owner or lessee of the vehicle, the bill permits the owner or lessee of the vehicle to maintain a private cause of action against the dealer in possession.","LastModified":"2017-12-22T15:44:31.827Z"}

The Task Force will also be required to submit a report about their conclusions and recommendations in examining the tax lien sale process. \r\n\r\nLocal Law 14 required the Mayor to appoint 5 members, and the Council to appoint 5 members each to the Board.

This is an interesting BID because it would be the City’s first BID consisting of three separate commercial strips under the umbrella of one BID. The BID would be comprised of 217 parcels of land containing 275 businesses, most of which are independently-owned and some of which are regional and national chain stores. The majority of the BID is commercial, but there are also public facilities, transportation and utilities, vacant land, and 82 residential units.\r\n\r\nThe BID would have a relatively small budget of $185,000 in its first year, with the average assessment being approximately $1,002 per year and the maximum projected assessment being $5,090 per year.","LastModified":"2016-03-01T20:47:17.567Z"}

The current licensing scheme dates from the early 20th Century and certain activities are not properly regulated. This bill would update the City’s laundry licensing law to better regulate the industry as it operates today. The bill would create a tiered licensing scheme to capture three distinct activities: retail laundry, industrial laundry and industrial laundry delivery. This bill would create additional requirements related to cleanliness and hygiene for industrial laundries and industrial laundry delivery services. Industrial laundries would be required to implement procedures to ensure that all laundry is hygienically cleaned and, businesses engaged in industrial laundry delivery would be required to implement procedures to ensure separation of clean and dirty laundry in order to maintain cleanliness. Finally, this bill would create a task force to review the industry and the enforcement of the law and make any recommendations to the Council and the Mayor.","LastModified":"2016-08-30T20:14:32.663Z"}

The program is operated by the Office of Emergency Management (OEM) in conjunction with the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH).  These centers include senior centers, community centers, and libraries. Throughout the year, the City monitors the heat index, which calculates the apparent temperature of the environment based on the actual temperature and the humidity. When the heat index reaches a certain level, the City issues a heat advisory to indicate a heat-related emergency. During such heat-related emergencies, the City opens cooling centers so that the people may seek relief from the outdoor environment. \r\n\r\nThe proposed legislation would codify the City’s cooling center program, requiring them to be open during heat-related emergencies and expanding the program to days when the AQI indicates that the air quality poses health risks to vulnerable populations.  The legislation would grant DOHMH, in conjunction with OEM, the discretion of designating the number and location of cooling centers, but would require that there be no fewer than the median number of cooling centers operated during heat-related emergencies in 2014.  In designating such centers, the agencies would have to take into account where vulnerable populations reside and where such populations would be likely to use centers.  In addition, DOHMH would be required to post information about the cooling center program on its website with a list of the cooling centers that will be available, and would also have to conduct a public education campaign to increase awareness of cool centers and the risks associated with heat-related emergencies and poor air quality.

Additionally, providers would have to post required signage in English, as well as in any languages in which they provide or offer to provide services. Providers would be prohibited from offering and providing services that should only be provided by an attorney, and from making statements that could lead a customer to believe that the provider is an attorney or an immigration expert.

The bill would require DoITT to report information on a quarterly basis regarding the number of inmates in DOC’s custody, based both on the average daily inmate population for the quarter and for the total number of inmate admissions that quarter. For those inmates detained pre-trial, the following information must be reported: the charges they are facing, how serious those charges are, how long these they have been detained, how much bail has been set on them, and their criminal record if any. For those inmates who were sentenced, DoITT must report the length of these inmates’ sentences. \r\n\r\nThe bill also requires DoITT to report on the court system’s impact on the DOC inmate population. For both felony and misdemeanor cases, DoITT must report the number of cases in which bail was set and the number of cases in which the defendant failed to appear for a court date, both for cases in which the defendant posted bail and for cases in which the defendant was released. The bill also requires DoITT to report on the number of cases in which defendants were released under specified conditions such as supervised release programs, the number of cases in which forms of bail other than cash or bail bonds are imposed, and the number of defendants who post bail.

The bill would also require the DOHMH to report on the number of such injuries they treat on a quarterly basis.\r\n\r\nThe bill would also require the Investigation Division of the DOC to investigate all such injuries, and to report on the outcomes of these investigations at every step of the process, including any disciplinary steps taken against staff who cause such injuries. The bill also requires the DOC to report on the number of such injuries that are incurred by inmates on a quarterly basis.\r\n\r\nThe bill also imposes parallel reporting requirements for incidents in which inmates assault Correction staff: the DOC must report on all injuries and serious injuries incurred by staff due to an assault by an inmate on a quarterly basis, must refer all such physical injuries to the Investigation Division of the DOC, and must refer all such serious injuries to the District Attorney’s office with jurisdiction over the alleged assault. The DOC must also make a good faith effort to obtain information from the District Attorney regarding the outcomes of any such referrals.","LastModified":"2017-12-22T16:09:15.22Z"}

This bill amends that law in two key ways. First, this bill adds three types of people to the list of those who cannot discriminate: anyone who buys or sells a franchise and anyone who leases space to a provider of public accommodations. Second, the bill declares that it is illegal to offer a person who is or is perceived to be a member of a protected class the same benefits, services, or privileges as everyone else, but in such a way that they do not receive “the full and equal enjoyment” of those benefits on “equal terms and conditions,” or to use discriminatory advertisements and public statements. The bill will also make additional minor or technical corrections to the existing law.","LastModified":"2016-05-16T15:52:10.7Z"}

The City currently does not have a comprehensive law relating to EJ. The bill requires the Mayor to establish an Interagency Working Group (IWG) consisting of representatives from City agencies relevant to EJ, including DEP, DOHMH, Planning, DOT, DSNY and DOB.  The IWG will be chaired by a special coordinator of EJ, who will be appointed by the Mayor.  The bill requires the IWG to develop a comprehensive Environmental Justice Plan (EJ Plan) that provides guidance on incorporating EJ concerns into City decision-making, identifies possible Citywide initiatives for promoting EJ and provides specific recommendations for City agencies to bring their operations, programs and projects in line with EJ concerns.  The IWG must update the EJ Plan every five years. The bill also establishes an EJ Advisory Board (AB) consisting of Mayoral and Speaker appointees, all of whom must have EJ qualifications.  The AB will make recommendations to the IWG concerning ways to promote EJ, will hold public hearings to fact-find and will closely consult the IWG during development of the EJ Plan.","LastModified":"2017-05-31T19:06:50.12Z"}

The bill would also amend the Charter provisions setting forth the Human Rights Commission’s powers: consolidating duplicative provisions and repealing them from the Code, clarifying existing enforcement authority and amending the annual report due date.

Currently, SBS and MOCS submit within their annual M/WBE report a list of all solicitations sent to the city chief procurement officer for review, and a summary of the determination made whether to divide the proposed contract. This bill would require more detailed information about how this determination was made.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the bill would change the dates by which each agency must submit their M/WBE utilization plan (from April 1 to July 31), anticipated contracting schedule (from July 31 to June 30), and performance improvement plan (in cases where the agency failed to achieve its utilization goals) (from October 1 to January 31).

Every year, the Commission would identify the 10 neighborhoods in the city with the highest rates of assault, murder, rape and robbery in the preceding two years and would develop a one-year plan for addressing the root causes of violence in those neighborhoods, which the Commission would provide to the Mayor and Council. After the designated end date of each one-year plan, the Commission would issue a follow-up report to the Mayor and Council assessing the implementation of the plan. Additionally, the Commission would issue an annual report to the Mayor and Council summarizing its activities over the previous year. The Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene would post the one-year plans and annual summaries, as well as public comments on both, to the Department’s website.","LastModified":"2017-12-22T17:16:42.527Z"}
