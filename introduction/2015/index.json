The program is operated by the Office of Emergency Management (OEM) in conjunction with the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH).  These centers include senior centers, community centers, and libraries. Throughout the year, the City monitors the heat index, which calculates the apparent temperature of the environment based on the actual temperature and the humidity. When the heat index reaches a certain level, the City issues a heat advisory to indicate a heat-related emergency. During such heat-related emergencies, the City opens cooling centers so that the people may seek relief from the outdoor environment. \r\n\r\nThe proposed legislation would codify the City’s cooling center program, requiring them to be open during heat-related emergencies and expanding the program to days when the AQI indicates that the air quality poses health risks to vulnerable populations.  The legislation would grant DOHMH, in conjunction with OEM, the discretion of designating the number and location of cooling centers, but would require that there be no fewer than the median number of cooling centers operated during heat-related emergencies in 2014.  In designating such centers, the agencies would have to take into account where vulnerable populations reside and where such populations would be likely to use centers.  In addition, DOHMH would be required to post information about the cooling center program on its website with a list of the cooling centers that will be available, and would also have to conduct a public education campaign to increase awareness of cool centers and the risks associated with heat-related emergencies and poor air quality.  Finally, DOHMH would have to conduct an annual survey on utilization of the program and submit a report annually to the Mayor and City Council on the program.","LastModified":"2017-12-22T15:58:54.013Z"}

In addition, the veteran’s combined earned and unearned income could not exceed 200 percent of the federal poverty level and resources could not exceed the limit for public assistance recipients under New York State Law. Veterans who meet these qualifications would be required to pay no more than 30 percent of their monthly income toward their rent.","LastModified":"2017-12-22T16:19:39.37Z"}
