This bill would also require the Commissioner or designee to establish a wage theft hotline to inform callers about the New York wage law and available resources for workers and, if the caller so requests, to send information about wage laws, including laws relating to wage theft, to businesses and employers. Finally, this bill would require the Commissioner or other designee to provide an annual report regarding the operation of the hotline and to make recommendations to the State Department of Labor regarding state labor law.","TextID":56432,"Text":"Int.
