  "Summary": "In 2013, the Department of Transportation announced that it would replace all 250,000 streetlights in New York City with energy-efficient light-emitting diode (LED) technology by 2017. The correlated color temperature of a streetlight is defined as the perceived color of the light emitted by a lamp, which is expressed in Kelvin (K) units. The color tone can range from warm (yellow and red) lighting to cool (blue) lighting.  This bill would require that any lamp installed as part of the lighting of streets, highways, parks, or any other public place have a correlated color temperature no higher than 3000 Kelvin. All new and replacement outdoor lamps would be required to meet this standard.",
