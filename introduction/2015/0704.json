  "Summary": "This bill would require SBS to produce a voluntary survey to be distributed to all prospective city contractors that would collect racial, ethnic and gender information regarding the executive boards of those companies. The Mayor would also assign a city agency to produce a report analyzing the information obtained from that survey.  Notably, no agency would be able to use the information obtained in the survey as a basis for any procurement decisions.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. By January 15, 2017, the department of small business services shall create a voluntary survey, to be distributed to and completed by proposed city contractors and subcontractors in conjunction with employment reports pursuant to subdivision e of section 1305 of the New York city charter. That survey shall solicit information regarding the selection and employment practices, policies, and procedures pertaining to the racial, ethnic and gender composition of such entities' directors, officers, and other executive-level staff members and such entities' plans for diversity in leadership. No information submitted to the department through such survey may be the basis for any decision by the city in relation to any contract award or renewal unless otherwise authorized by law.\n      � 2. a.
