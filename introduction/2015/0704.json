  "Summary": "This bill would require SBS to produce a voluntary survey to be distributed to all prospective city contractors that would collect racial, ethnic and gender information regarding the executive boards of those companies. The Mayor would also assign a city agency to produce a report analyzing the information obtained from that survey.  Notably, no agency would be able to use the information obtained in the survey as a basis for any procurement decisions.",
