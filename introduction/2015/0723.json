  "Summary": "This bill would require that the business owner’s bill of rights, which advises business owners of their rights as they relate to agency inspections, include translations in at least the top six languages spoken by limited-English proficient individuals as those languages are determined by the Department of City Planning based on United States census data.  \r\n\r\nThe bill would also require that the standardized customer service training curriculum developed by the Mayor’s Office of Operations for training agency inspectors include specific protocols for inspectors to follow when interacting with non-English speakers to ensure that such inspectors provide language translation services during inspections.",
