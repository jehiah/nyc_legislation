The report would be required to include an analysis of trends and the characteristics of violations dismissed and reasons for dismissal and a comparison to previous reports issued pursuant to this law. Finally, it would be required to include planned actions that the Department will take to minimize the issuance of violations that are ultimately dismissed.","TextID":56216,"Text":"Int.
