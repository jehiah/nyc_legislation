Thus, the Code places restrictions in several locations in which the placement of newsracks would present safety concerns to persons and property.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed bill would prohibit the placement, installation, or maintenance of newsracks within three feet ahead or 25 feet to the rear of any designated taxi stand. Furthermore, it provides that the law would take effect 90 days after enactment into law, but authorizes the Commissioner of the Department of Transportation to take actions necessary to implement the law prior to its effective date.","TextID":55493,"Text":"Int.
