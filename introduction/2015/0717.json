  "Summary": "Proposed Int. No. 717-A would require reporting on idling complaints and their dispositions. It would also increase the award for citizen enforcement of idling complaints from an amount which “shall not exceed 25%” of proceeds collected to 25% of such proceeds where the department of environmental protection brings the proceeding. Finally this legislation requires the department to publish on its website the best practices for filing citizen complaints and gathering documentation.",
