  "Summary": "This bill seeks to prohibit landlords from refusing to rent to prospective tenants solely because they appear on a “Tenant Black List.” Tenant screening lists are used to identify supposedly risky renters by naming tenants who have been involved in a Housing Court case, however, they do not take into account the outcome of a case (i.e., whether or not a tenant is successful, or whether the tenant initiated the action). The bill adds “participating in a housing court proceeding” to the list of protected classes in the Housing Accommodations section of the Civil Rights title of the Administrative Code.",
