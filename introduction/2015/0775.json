  "Summary": "This bill would impose a timeline on designation of landmarks, interior landmarks, scenic landmarks, and historic districts. For individual landmarks, the bill would require the Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) to designate a property as a landmark within one year of calendaring the property for consideration, with the option for a one year extension with owner consent. For historic districts the time period would be two years from the time the property is calendared. Lastly, the bill would require LPC to make a determination on whether to designate items (both individual landmarks and historic districts) that are currently on the calendar within 18 months of the effective date of the local law. \r\n\r\nIn all cases, if LPC disapproves or fails to designate any item, the property in question would be automatically removed from the calendar.",
