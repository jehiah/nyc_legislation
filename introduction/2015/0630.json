This bill adds a new part to section 528 that provides that the Chancellor, after consulting with the NYPD and school principals, may adopt any additional election-day school security measures that the Chancellor considers appropriate for the protection of students and staff when any such schools are used as polling places on any election day. This bill also makes certain corrections to the current section 528.","TextID":55347,"Text":"Int.
