SBS currently provides such services through its Workforce1 program. \r\n\r\nThis bill would require the Commissioner of SBS to annually report to the Mayor and the Council on Workforce1 and any other SBS employment referral program the following information for the prior fiscal year:  the number of new registrants in each program, the job placement rate for each program, the job categories in which registrants obtained employment through each program, and the wages registrants received in such placements.  The bill would require SBS to report such information disaggregated by the Council districts in which registrants live.","TextID":55418,"Text":"Int.
