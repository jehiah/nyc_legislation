This bill would remove this limitation and instead provide this information for all agency contracts. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the bill would amend the contractual value ranges for which information is reported by clarifying that the number and total value of contracts must be reported by: those contracts at or below the micro-purchase limit, between the micro-purchase limit and the small purchase limit, and between the small purchase limit and $1 million (in addition to the already existing ranges of $1-5 million, $5-20 million, and above $25 million). Finally, the bill would require that the data providing a basis for the M/WBE report be made available to the Council electronically in an extractable format.","TextID":58269,"Text":"Int.
