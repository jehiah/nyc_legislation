  "Summary": "In enforcing misdemeanors and non-criminal offenses, the New York City Police Department (“NYPD”) may either arrest the offender, issue a desk appearance ticket, or issue either a criminal or civil summons. The difference between a desk appearance and a summons is that issuing a desk appearance ticket requires the offender to be fingerprinted and booked, typically at a police precinct. This bill would require the NYPD to issue a quarterly report on the number of desk appearance tickets issued, disaggregated by the race, gender, and age of the person to whom it was issued, as well as the offense charged and the precinct in which it was issued.",
