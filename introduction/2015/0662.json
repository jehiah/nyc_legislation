  "Summary": "In enforcing misdemeanors and non-criminal offenses, the New York City Police Department (“NYPD”) may either arrest the offender, issue a desk appearance ticket, or issue either a criminal or civil summons. The difference between a desk appearance and a summons is that issuing a desk appearance ticket requires the offender to be fingerprinted and booked, typically at a police precinct. This bill would require the NYPD to issue a quarterly report on the number of desk appearance tickets issued, disaggregated by the race, gender, and age of the person to whom it was issued, as well as the offense charged and the precinct in which it was issued.",
  "TextID": 57783,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n      Section 1. Title 14 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 14-156 to read as follows:\n        �14-156 Desk appearance ticket report. a. The commissioner shall submit to the council and the mayor, and post to the department's website, within 30 days of the beginning of each quarter, a report regarding the use of desk appearance tickets for the previous quarter. This report shall include the guidelines used by the department to determine when desk appearance tickets are used in lieu of a custodial arrest pursuant to subdivision 1 of section 140.20 of the penal law. This report shall also include, for any offense for which a desk appearance ticket may be issued by state law and for which either more than 500 desk appearance tickets were issued or for which more than 500 arrests were made pursuant to subdivision 1 of section 140.20 of the penal law, the rate of the use of arrests and desk appearance tickets for each such offense. This report shall also include the number of desk appearance tickets issued, in total and disaggregated as follows: \n      1. the patrol precinct, housing police service area and transit district in which such desk appearance ticket was issued; \n      2. the borough in which such desk appearance ticket was issued;\n      3. race; \n      4. gender; \n      5. age; and \n      6. offense charged. \n      b. The information in subdivision a of this section shall be stored permanently on the department's website, and each quarterly report shall include a comparison of the current quarter to the same quarter in the prior three years, and the current year to the prior five years, where such information is available.\n      � 2.
