  "Summary": "The bill would require the Department of Transportation (DOT) to conduct a study on the safety of pedestrians and bicyclists along bus routes. Based on the study, the DOT would institute measures to decrease incidents involving buses and pedestrians or bicyclists along such routes, including allowing left turns to be made only on a green left arrow signal indication and other restrictions on left turns, use of curb extensions, lane narrowing and/or removal, leading pedestrian intervals, and traffic calming devices. DOT would post online and submit to the Council the study—which must include the locations of such measures and if DOT declined to implement measures, the reasons why—to the Council no later than May 1, 2016.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      Section 1. For the purposes of this local law, the following terms have the following meanings:\n      Bus route. The term \"bus route\" means a route that is traveled upon by a bus that is operated or owned by the metropolitan transportation authority.\n      Curb extension. The term \"curb extension\" means an expansion of the curb line into the lane of the roadway adjacent to the curb for at least 15 feet closest to a corner or mid-block where pedestrians are permitted to cross the roadway.\n      Leading pedestrian interval. The term \"leading pedestrian interval\" means a pedestrian control signal that displays a walk indication before a green indication for the parallel direction of traffic.\n      Traffic calming device. The term \"traffic calming device\" means any device, not governed by the manual on uniform traffic control devices, including, but not limited to, speed humps, curb extensions, traffic diverters, median barriers and raised walkways, installed on a street and intended to slow, reduce or alter motor vehicle traffic to improve safety for pedestrians and bicyclists.\n      � 2. The department of transportation, in collaboration with the metropolitan transportation authority, shall conduct a study of incidents involving buses and pedestrians or bicyclists resulting in death or serious injury to such pedestrian or bicyclist occurring along bus routes within the previous three years. Based on such study, the department shall institute measures designed to decrease incidents involving pedestrians and bicyclists along such routes based on best practices for roadway design and operations, including but not limited to, allowing left turns to be made only on a green left arrow signal indication and other restrictions on left turns, use of curb extensions, lane narrowing and/or removal, leading pedestrian intervals, and traffic calming devices. No later than May 1, 2016, the department shall post online and submit to the speaker of the council such study, including the locations of such measures, and if no measures are implemented at a location along a bus route where an incident has occurred within the past three years, the reasons why.\n      � 3.
