  "Summary": "This bill would require the Taxi and Limousine Commission (“TLC”) to develop a policy that, among other things, (1) establishes a uniform method of calculating suggested tips for passengers who pay their fares by credit card or debit card, (2) requires TLC to provide notice informing passengers paying their fares and tips by credit card or debit card about how suggested tip amounts are calculated, and (3) requires TLC to give passengers the option to designate their own tip amount instead of paying the tip amounts set by TLC. TLC will also be able to assign civil penalties of not less than $100 and not more than $500 for any violations of the rules it promulgates in connection with this bill.",
