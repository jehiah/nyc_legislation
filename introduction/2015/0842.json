  "Summary": "The bill would require the Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) to limit the issuance of for-hire vehicle licenses through April 30, 2016. New for-hire vehicle licenses would only be issued in limited numbers to vehicles affiliated with existing bases to allow for some growth, based on the number of vehicles affiliated with a base as of June 15, 2015. Existing for-hire vehicle licenses would continue to be renewed. Street hail livery vehicle and base licenses would not be impacted. Following the completion of the study, the TLC would be required to submit to the Speaker and the Mayor recommendations for mitigating any impacts identified.",

The taxi and limousine commission shall only issue new for-hire vehicle licenses in accordance with this local law through April 30, 2016. \n      � 2. The commission shall only issue new for-hire vehicle licenses if such vehicle will affiliate with a base station, black car base, or luxury limousine base that was licensed on June 15, 2015 that has not yet reached the maximum number of such newly licensed vehicles that may be affiliated with such base pursuant to this local law.\n      � 3. If a base station, black car base, or luxury limousine base has 500 or more affiliated vehicles as of June 15, 2015, such base may affiliate with up to the number of vehicles newly licensed pursuant to this section that is equal to one percent of the number of vehicles affiliated with such base as of June 15, 2015, rounded to the nearest whole number.\n      � 4. If a base station, black car base, or luxury limousine base has 499 to 20 affiliated vehicles as of June 15, 2015, such base may affiliate with up to the number of vehicles newly licensed pursuant to this section that is equal to five percent of the number of vehicles affiliated with such base as of June 15, 2015, rounded to the nearest whole number.\n      � 5. If a base station, black car base, or luxury limousine base has 19 or fewer affiliated vehicles as of June 15, 2015, such base may affiliate with up to the number of vehicles newly licensed pursuant to this local law that is equal to 15 percent of the number of vehicles affiliated with such base as of June 15, 2015, rounded to the nearest whole number; provided, however, that each such base may affiliate with at least two vehicles newly licensed pursuant to this local law.  \n      � 6.

Following the completion of study on the impact of growth in the taxicab and for-hire vehicle industries, the commission shall submit to the speaker of the council and the mayor recommendations for mitigating any impacts identified, including but not limited to, proposals to restrict the issuance of for-hire vehicle licenses and/or base station, black car base station, or luxury limousine base station licenses.\n      � 9.
