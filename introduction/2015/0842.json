New for-hire vehicle licenses would only be issued in limited numbers to vehicles affiliated with existing bases to allow for some growth, based on the number of vehicles affiliated with a base as of June 15, 2015. Existing for-hire vehicle licenses would continue to be renewed. Street hail livery vehicle and base licenses would not be impacted. Following the completion of the study, the TLC would be required to submit to the Speaker and the Mayor recommendations for mitigating any impacts identified.","TextID":56488,"Text":"Proposed Int.
