Certain housing companies would also be required to provide their tenants with such a notice. This legislation would require the Department of Housing Preservation and Development to determine the form of the notice. Finally, this bill would make owners who fail to comply with this section liable for a civil penalty of one hundred fifty dollars for each dwelling unit for which there was a failure to comply and provide the Environmental Control Board with the power to impose such a penalty.","TextID":55425,"Text":"Int.
