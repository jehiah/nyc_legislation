  "Summary": "This local law would mandate that the Office of Long Term Planning and Sustainability set five year benchmarks by sector for greenhouse gas emissions reductions, including the buildings sector, the transportation sector and other sectors identified by the office, to ensure that the city has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by eighty percent by 2050. This local law requires that such benchmarks be updated as needed but at least every five years. This local law also requires progress reports to be issued every two years detailing the emissions reductions and any impediments to further reductions.",

Subdivision a of section 24-803 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding new paragraphs (3) and (4) to read as follows:\n      (3), The office shall establish five-year benchmarks for emissions reductions in new and existing buildings, transportation infrastructure, vehicles and other sectors that such office identifies; provided that such benchmarks, when aggregated, yield the emissions reductions required by paragraph one of this subdivision. Such benchmarks shall be updated as needed and at least once every five years.\n      (4) No later than two years after the effective date of the local law that added this paragraph, and in every second year thereafter, the office shall report on the city's progress toward satisfying the benchmarks described in paragraph three of this subdivision and the emissions reductions required by paragraph one of this subdivision. Such report shall identify any obstacles to satisfying such benchmarks and requirements and, for each such obstacle, shall include recommendations for overcoming or lessening the effects of such obstacle. \n      ï¿½ 2.
