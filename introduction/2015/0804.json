  "Summary": "The New York City Human Rights Law currently requires the entities that it covers to make reasonable accommodations for victims of domestic violence, individuals with pregnancy and related conditions, religious needs, and disabilities. This bill clarifies the reasonable accommodation requirement by expressly requiring covered entities to engage in or seek to engage in a cooperative dialogue with individuals who may be entitled to such accommodation, in order to identify what reasonable accommodations are available to assist them. Int. 804-A applies to employers, providers of public accommodations, and providers of housing accommodations.",
