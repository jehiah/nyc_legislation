  "Summary": "This bill requires the Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR) to test for methane gas emissions before planting a new or replacement tree. If methane gas emissions are found at a proposed tree planting site, DPR must notify the responsible utility about the immediate repair of the leak. The bill also requires DPR to keep a record of all detected emissions and post on its website the locations of any detected gas emissions that have not been repaired within 14 calendar days after DPR has notified the responsible utility of the detected gas emissions.",
