  "Summary": "The bill would require the Department of Homeless Services (DHS) to provide to the City Council and to post on its website an annual report regarding mental health services provided to individuals and families in the shelter system. The report would include the number of shelters with on-site services and a description of the available services, a description of the mental health services available at intake facilities and the availability of mental health services to the unsheltered population, including the number of individuals who are removed pursuant to the State Mental Hygeine Law. The bill would also require DHS to include in the report the most commonly occurring mental health issues among adults and children in the shelter system.",
