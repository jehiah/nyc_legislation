  "Summary": "Section 12-126 of the Administrative Code extends health insurance to the families of certain City workers who die in-the-line-of-duty. The Council routinely amends this section to add workers not automatically covered by other sections (mostly uniformed services), who are killed in-the-line-of-duty.  At present, the law only covers children up to age 22. This law increases the age for children to be covered to 27, which conforms this law to the Federal Affordable Care Act.",
