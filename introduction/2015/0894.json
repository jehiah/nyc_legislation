  "Summary": "As of June 2013, there were more than 1.4 million LGBT-owned small businesses in the United States. However, there are a limited number of studies that indicate whether there is a need to assist such businesses in obtaining government contracts. Because New York City is a leader in providing equality and fairness to all people, this bill would require the New York City Department of Small Business Services to conduct a study to determine whether LGBT-owned businesses in New York City face difficulties participating in the City’s procurement process.",

Title 6 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 6-138.3 to read as follows:\n      � 6-138.3. Participation by Lesbian Gay Bisexual and Transgender (\"LGBT\")-owned business enterprises in city procurement.\n      The commissioner of the department of small business services, in consultation with the city chief procurement officer, shall, for each industry classification, review and compare the availability rates of LGBT-owned firms and the utilization rates of such firms, in agency contracts and direct subcontracts. In conducting such review, the commissioner shall establish a LGBT certification program to help determine availability rates of LGBT-owned firms. On the basis of such review and any other information, including but not limited to, information relevant to the extent to which discrimination has an impact on the ability of LGBT-owned businesses to compete for city contracts and subcontracts, the commissioner shall, by January 1, 2017, determine the need for a citywide program to promote opportunities in city procurement for LGBT business owners. The commissioner shall submit to the council a report on such review, including the basis for such determination by January 1, 2017.\n      \n      �2.
