  "Summary": "This bill would clarify which workers are protected by the City Human Rights Law. It would repeal the provision that provides that interns should be protected just as employees are protected, and instead defines the term employee to include, among others, interns. The bill would also clarify which independent contractors are protected by the Human Rights Law, and how to determine whether an employer has four or more employees (which triggers some of the obligations of the City Human Rights Law). Finally, this bill would make explicit that part-time, temporary, leased and seasonal workers are covered by the City Human Rights Law.",
