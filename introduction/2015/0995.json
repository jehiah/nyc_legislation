In addition, this bill would make it an unlawful discriminatory practice for an owner of an affordable housing unit to (i) use the consumer credit history of anyone other than the designated representative of a household or (ii) fail to disclose the process and criteria by which the consumer credit history of the designated representative will be evaluated.",
