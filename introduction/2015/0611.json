Currently, the Board consists of nine members, all of whom must be veterans. Five of the members are appointed by the Mayor, and four are appointed by the Speaker of the City Council. Members serve for three year terms. The Mayor and the Speaker are required to considered service in conflicts when making their appointments.\r\n\r\nThis bill would expand the Veterans Advisory Board to eleven members, allowing the Mayor to appoint six members and the Speaker of the City Council to appoint five members. Additionally, the bill would require that MOVA ensure each member of the Board receive a city email address upon appointment. Such email address is to be made available to the public on the MOVA website within 30 days of the appointment.","TextID":55616,"Text":"Int.
