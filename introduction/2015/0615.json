  "Summary": "All taxis and for-hire vehicles in New York City are equipped with “trouble lights” that allow drivers to notify the public and law enforcement if they are under assault or are otherwise endangered while operating their vehicle. Currently, the Administrative Code limits the type of light that may be used to so-called “lollipop” lights. The legislation would remove the requirement that only “lollipop” lights be used as trouble lights, enabling the use of other technologies, such as LED lights, or more cost efficient options.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n \n      Section 1. Paragraphs one and two of subdivision c of section 19-508 of the administrative code of the city of New York are amended to read as follows:\n      1. For purposes of this section, the term \"trouble light\" shall mean a help or distress signaling light system consisting of [two turn signal type \"lollipop\" lights] a device or devices as  designated by the rules of the commission.\n      2. Every for-hire vehicle or taxicab placed into operation shall carry a minimum of two  spare [turn signal type \"lollipop\" lights] trouble light devices of a type approved by the commission. In the event that any authorized enforcement agent indicates to a for-hire vehicle or taxicab driver that the vehicle's trouble light is defective, such driver shall have the opportunity to return such defective trouble light to proper working order by replacing it [one or both bulbs], or by any other corrective action in the presence of such enforcement agent. If the replacement of a [bulb or bulbs] trouble light device, or any other corrective action, restores the trouble light to proper working order, no summons or notice of violation may be issued for operating a for-hire vehicle or taxicab with a defective trouble light. In the event that repair of the defective condition is not made in the presence of such enforcement agent and a summons or notice of violation is issued for a defective for-hire vehicle or taxicab trouble light, such summons or notice of violation shall be dismissed by the adjudicatory body before which such summons or notice of violation is heard if: (a) proof that repair of such defect was made within twenty-four hours of the issuance of the summons or notice of violation is provided to the adjudicatory body and (b) the vehicle was not used for hire during the period of time from when the summons or notice of violation was issued to the time the repair was made.    \n\t� 2. This local law shall take effect 90 days after its enactment into law.\n\nKET 1/14/15 5:22PM\nLS 3713/2014",
