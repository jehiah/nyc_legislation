  "Summary": "This local law would mandate the installation of occupancy sensors to limit illumination in city-owned buildings and city-controlled spaces. This requirement would apply to spaces in at least 50% of city-owned or controlled buildings by 2020; at least 80% of such buildings by 2025; and all such buildings by 2030. This local law would also require periodic reporting concerning energy savings resulting from the occupancy sensor requirements.",
