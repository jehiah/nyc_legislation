  "Summary": "The New York City Human Rights Law prohibits anyone who owns, leases, runs, manages or works for a “place or provider of public accommodation” from discriminating against customers on protected grounds such as race, gender, and age. The law defines “place or provider of public accommodation” broadly, covering “providers” of “goods, services, facilities, accommodations, advantages or privileges of any kind” and covering places that offer those goods, services, and the like. That definition has always covered, but not explicitly listed, government bodies that provide such goods and services to the public. The Human Rights Law currently defines the term “person” to include government bodies. The proposed bill makes clear that any “person” who provides goods, services, facilities, accommodations, advantages or privileges to the public counts as a place or provider of public accommodation.",
