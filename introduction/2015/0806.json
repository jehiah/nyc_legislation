  "Summary": "This bill would authorize the Commissioner of Finance to establish a 90-day, temporary program to resolve outstanding penalties imposed by the Environmental Control Board in Fiscal 2017. With certain conditions, such program would permit those who are subject to judgments as a result of a default decision to resolve those judgments by paying the base penalty and having the default penalty and accrued interest waived. It would also permit, with certain conditions, those who are subject to judgments as a result of a finding by the ECB that they were in violation to resolve those judgments by paying 75 percent of the imposed penalty and having the accrued interest waived.\r\n\r\nAfter the conclusion of the temporary program, for any judgment that arose from a default decision that was eligible to be resolved as part of the temporary program, the Department of Finance would not be permitted to resolve such judgment by accepting payment of anything less than half of the default penalty and accrued interest.",
