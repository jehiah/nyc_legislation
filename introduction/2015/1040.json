  "Summary": "This bill would create a Community Violence Commission to study the root causes of violence and make recommendations for addressing violence as a public health crisis. Every year, the Commission would identify the 10 neighborhoods in the city with the highest rates of assault, murder, rape and robbery in the preceding two years and would develop a one-year plan for addressing the root causes of violence in those neighborhoods, which the Commission would provide to the Mayor and Council. After the designated end date of each one-year plan, the Commission would issue a follow-up report to the Mayor and Council assessing the implementation of the plan. Additionally, the Commission would issue an annual report to the Mayor and Council summarizing its activities over the previous year. The Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene would post the one-year plans and annual summaries, as well as public comments on both, to the Department’s website.",
