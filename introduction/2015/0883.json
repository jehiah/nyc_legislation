Agencies are required to encourage their contractors to comply with this requirement, and community boards and community district education councils are permitted to comply if practicable. Furthermore, the bill would require that publicity materials, to the extent practicable for the particular form of media, include information regarding the availability of wheelchair accessibility, communication access real-time translation, sign language interpretation, assistive listening systems, and any other accommodations. Finally, the Mayor’s Office for People with Disabilities would be required to develop and distribute a guide to assist agencies in complying with these requirements.",
