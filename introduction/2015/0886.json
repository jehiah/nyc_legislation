  "Summary": "Environmental Justice (EJ) means the fair treatment and involvement of all persons, regardless of race, color, national origin or income, with respect to the development, implementation and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, policies and activities, and with respect to the distribution of environmental benefits (such as financial assistance for environmental projects).  The City currently does not have a comprehensive law relating to EJ. The bill requires the Mayor to establish an Interagency Working Group (IWG) consisting of representatives from City agencies relevant to EJ, including DEP, DOHMH, Planning, DOT, DSNY and DOB.  The IWG will be chaired by a special coordinator of EJ, who will be appointed by the Mayor.  The bill requires the IWG to develop a comprehensive Environmental Justice Plan (EJ Plan) that provides guidance on incorporating EJ concerns into City decision-making, identifies possible Citywide initiatives for promoting EJ and provides specific recommendations for City agencies to bring their operations, programs and projects in line with EJ concerns.  The IWG must update the EJ Plan every five years. The bill also establishes an EJ Advisory Board (AB) consisting of Mayoral and Speaker appointees, all of whom must have EJ qualifications.  The AB will make recommendations to the IWG concerning ways to promote EJ, will hold public hearings to fact-find and will closely consult the IWG during development of the EJ Plan.",
