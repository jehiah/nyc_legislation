  "Summary": "This local law requires that the Office of Long Term Planning or such other office as the Mayor may designate to establish a New York City Office of Solar Energy. Such office shall be headed by a director who shall be appointed by the mayor or by the head of such department. The director shall have the power and the duty to. develop and coordinate the implementation of solar policies, programs expanding solar access to ensure it is more equitably distributed by targeting additional assistance for communities that have historically had limited access due to financial hardship, technical constraints, or other reasons and rapidly scaling up innovative solar programs, including community-based group purchasing and shared solar programs, which would provide more New Yorkers with the opportunity to benefit from this renewable energy source. The director shall develop and coordinate the implementation of a comprehensive, long-term solar energy implementation plan designed such that the city shall reach its maximum solar energy potential by two thousand thirty. No later than April two thousand eighteen, and no later than every four years thereafter, the director shall develop and submit to the mayor and the speaker of the city council an updated long-term solar energy installation plan, setting forth goals associated with each category established pursuant to paragraph one of subdivision b of this section and any additional categories established by the director. An updated plan shall include, for each four-year period beginning on the date an updated plan is submitted to the mayor and the speaker of the city council, implementation milestones for each policy, program and action contained in such plan. An updated plan shall report on the status of the milestones contained in the immediately preceding updated plan. The director shall post on the city's website, a copy of the updated long term solar energy implementation plan. This local law shall take effect immediately.",
