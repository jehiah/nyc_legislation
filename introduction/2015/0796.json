  "Summary": "This bill would require staff at the 26 agencies that participate in the agency-based voter registration program to give assist individuals who receive voter registration forms with the section of the form allowing them to register to become an organ and tissue donor in New York State, if such assistance is requested or if assistance is normally provided with the agency’s own forms.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n      Section 1. The opening paragraph of section 1057-a of the New York city charter, as amended by local law number 52 for the year 2003, and as amended by local law 63 for the year 2014, is amended to read as follows:\n      Each agency designated as a participating agency under the provisions of this section shall implement and administer a program of distribution of voter registration forms pursuant to the provisions of this section. The following offices are hereby designated as participating voter registration agencies: The administration for children's services, the business integrity commission, the city clerk, the civilian complaint review board, the commission on human rights, community boards, the department of small business services, the department for the aging, the department of citywide administrative services, the department of city planning, the department of consumer affairs, the department of correction, the department of cultural affairs, the department of environmental protection, the department of finance, the department of health and mental hygiene, the department of homeless services, the department of housing preservation and development, the department of parks and recreation, the department of probation, the department of records and information services, the taxi and limousine commission, the department of transportation, the department of youth and community development, the fire department, and the human resources administration. Participating agencies shall include a mandate in all new or renewed agreements with those subcontractors having regular contact with the public in the daily administration of their business to follow the guidelines of this section. Such participating agencies shall be required to offer voter registration forms to all persons together with written applications for services, renewal or recertification for services and change of address relating to such services, in the same language as such application, renewal, recertification or change of address form where practicable; provided however that this section shall not apply to services that must be provided to prevent actual or potential danger to the life, health, or safety of any individual or of the public. Such agencies shall provide assistance to applicants in completing voter registration forms, including the section of the form allowing for registration to become an organ donor, and in cases in which such an agency would provide assistance with its own form, such agency shall provide the same degree of assistance with regard to the voter registration [form] and organ donor forms as is provided with regard to the completion of its own form, if so requested. Such agencies shall also receive and transmit the completed application form from any applicants who request to have such form transmitted to the board of elections for the city of New York.\n      � 2. Subdivision 2 of section 1057-a of the New York city charter, as added by local law number 29 for the year 2000, as renumbered by vote of the electors of the city of New York at a general election held on November 6, 2001, and as amended by local law 63 for the year 2014, is amended to read as follows:\n      2. Participating agencies shall provide and distribute voter registration forms to all persons together with written applications for services, renewal or recertification for services and change of address relating to such services, in the same language as such application, renewal, recertification or change of address form where practicable; provided however that this section shall not apply to services that must be provided to prevent actual or potential danger to life, health or safety of any individual or of the public. Participating agency staff shall provide assistance in completing these distributed voter registration forms, including the section of the form allowing for registration to become an organ donor, and in cases in which such an agency would provide assistance with its own form, such agency shall provide the same degree of assistance with regard to the voter registration [form] and organ donor forms as is provided with regard to the completion of its own form, if so requested.
