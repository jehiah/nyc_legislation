  "Summary": "This bill would amend the Housing Maintenance Code’s definition of “harassment” to make it unlawful for a dwelling owner, or an owner’s agent, to make a tenant buyout offer without first: (1) notifying the tenant that he or she has the right to refuse the buyout offer, and (2) disclosing that the person making the buyout offer is an agent of the tenant’s landlord (where such person is someone other than the landlord).",
  "TextID": 56540,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      Section 1. Declaration of legislative intent and findings. a. The council finds and declares that:\n\t1. While there are legitimate reasons for building owners to make buyout offers to tenants by offering money or other valuable consideration to vacate their apartments, some tenants do not understand their rights with respect to buyout offers, including their right to reject such an offer and remain in their apartment or to seek guidance from an attorney, and some tenants do not understand what a buyout offer is or that such offer is being made on behalf of the owner of the building in which they reside; \n\t2. Tenants cannot meaningfully accept, reject or negotiate such offers without such an understanding; and\n\t3. The city has a substantial interest in balancing the rights of building owners to make these buyout offers with the rights of tenants to meaningfully accept, reject or negotiate such offers or to refuse contact regarding such offers.\n      b. The council finds that it is necessary and appropriate to require the disclosure of certain factual and uncontroversial information in connection with buyout offers in order to protect tenants from confusion or deception.\n      � 2.

While there are legitimate reasons for building owners to make buyout offers to tenants by offering money or other valuable consideration to vacate their apartments, some tenants do not understand their rights with respect to buyout offers, including their right to reject such an offer and remain in their apartment or to seek guidance from an attorney, and some tenants do not understand what a buyout offer is or that such offer is being made on behalf of the owner of the building in which they reside; \\par\n\\tab 2.
