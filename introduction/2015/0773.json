The report would provide information about initiatives and programs aimed at increasing student participation in the meals. The report would include information about the food items offered at each meal, and would require future reports to include year-to-year comparisons with the preceding year’s report. The information required to be reported would be disaggregated by school, community school district and borough.","TextID":60395,"Text":"Int.
