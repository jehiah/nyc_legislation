  "Summary": "Title 8 of the New York City Administrative Code prohibits source of income discrimination in housing. However, the prohibition against source of income discrimination does not apply to housing accommodations that contain a total of five or fewer housing units unless (1) a housing accommodation is rent-stabilized; or (2) the owner has a right to rent or lease in any building in the City that has six or more units. This bill would amend the Human Rights Law to prohibit source of income discrimination in all cases, regardless of the number of units in the housing accommodation.",
