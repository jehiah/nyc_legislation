  "Summary": "This bill would require covered developers to submit workforce disclosure records to an agency designated by the Mayor on the number of hours worked, job title, full or part-time designation and gross wages of individuals working on covered projects. Covered developers would also need to provide workforce disclosure records for the gender and race or ethnic group of employees when such information is voluntarily provided for the purpose of reporting to the city. \r\n\r\nBy no later than October 31, 2021 the mayoral agency designated to administer this program would be required to make such information available online only when it could be sufficiently anonymized, and, beginning no later than October 31, 2022, publish such information in a report every five years.",
