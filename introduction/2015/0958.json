  "Summary": "This bill would require the Coordinator of the Office of Civil Justice and the Coordinator of Criminal Justice, respectively, to develop client satisfaction surveys to be completed by persons who have been represented by city-funded attorneys in legal matters. The survey would measure the client’s satisfaction with the repr¬esentation, including the attorney’s overall performance, investigation of the case, efficiency, and communication and the level of participation allowed to the client.\r\n\r\nThe bill would require that the surveys be distributed to attorneys who provide indigent legal services and that those attorneys give these surveys to clients at the conclusion of the attorney’s representation of the client, but the bill would make completion of the survey optional. \r\n\r\nFinally, the bill would require the Coordinator of the Office of Civil Justice and the Coordinator of Criminal Justice, respectively, to compile and report on the results of surveys collected and make recommendations for systemic change to improve clients’ experience with legal services provided by city-funded attorneys.",
