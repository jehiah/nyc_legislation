Chapter five of title 19 of the administrative code of the city of New York section is amended to add a new section 19-544 to read as follows: \n\t� 19-544 Reporting of assaults on commission licensed drivers. On or before December 1, 2015 and quarterly thereafter, the commission shall for the prior quarter provide a report to the council and shall post on its website the number of complaints to a city law enforcement agency alleging assault on a driver licensed by the commission, disaggregated by the type of commission license held.

Where necessary, the department may use preliminary data to prepare such reports and may include an acknowledgment that such preliminary data is non-final and subject to change. For purposes of this section, \"assault\" has the same meaning as set forth in article 120 of the penal law.\n\t� 2.
