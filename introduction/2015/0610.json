  "Summary": "Chapter 5 of Title 20 of the administrative code of the city of New York regulates unfair trade practices. There has been a spate of infections and other serious health issues at businesses that provide appearance enhancement services. Appearance enhancement include: nail specialty, waxing, natural hair styling, the practice of esthetics and cosmetology as defined by section 400 of the New York state general business law. This bill would add a new subchapter (19) to require the department of consumer affairs to create a list of appearance enhancement consumers’ rights that will be disclosed to all consumers of these businesses located within the city of New York.",
