  "Summary": "The bill would require the Mayor’s Office to Combat Domestic Violence (OCDV) to provide clients with service satisfaction surveys after they have received domestic violence services from OCDV. Completion of the survey by clients would not be mandatory and would be anonymous. OCDV would be required to submit to the New York City Council, on an annual basis, all service satisfaction surveys and data completed, specifically on November 1 of each year. The data submitted to the New York City Council would be disaggregated by borough and by victim status. Victim status would mean domestic violence, sexual abuse, elder abuse, human trafficking, or any other category OCDV would deem appropriate. \r\n\r\nThe bill would require all agencies to provide, upon request from OCDV, all information needed for compliance with the bill. OCDV would also be required to make best efforts to ensure that other entities provide information as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of the bill.",
