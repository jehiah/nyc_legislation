Currently the report is due annually on January 1st. The bill would extend the deadline to March 1st annually in order to provide an adequate amount of time for DYCD and ACS to prepare the report. The bill would also amend the provision to require the report to be posted online and make a technical change to fix an error with the disaggregated age groups.","TextID":57450,"Text":"Int.
