  "Summary": "The bill would establish the right of way for pedestrians while crossing the roadway during various pedestrian control signal phases. Other traffic would be required to yield the right of way to pedestrians when a steady walking person, flashing upraised hand, or flashing upraised hand with a countdown clock is displayed on a pedestrian control signal.",
  "TextID": 58222,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n      Section 1. Subchapter 3 of chapter 1 of title 19 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 19-195 to read as follows:\n      � 19-195 Pedestrian control signals. Whenever pedestrian control signals are in operation, exhibiting symbols of a walking person, upraised hand, or upraised hand with a pedestrian countdown display, or any other internationally recognized representation concerning the movement of pedestrians, such signals shall indicate as follows:\n      1. Steady walking person. Pedestrians facing such signal may proceed across the roadway in the direction of such signal, and other traffic shall yield the right of way to such pedestrians.\n      2. Flashing upraised hand or flashing upraised hand with pedestrian countdown display. Pedestrians facing such signal are advised that there may be insufficient time to cross the roadway. Pedestrians already in the roadway shall proceed to the nearest sidewalk or safety island in the direction of such signal. Other traffic shall yield the right of way to pedestrians proceeding across the roadway within the crosswalk towards such signal for as long as such signal remains flashing. \n      3. Steady upraised hand. No pedestrians shall start to cross the roadway in the direction of such signal; provided, however that any pedestrians who have partially completed their crossing on a steady walking person signal or any flashing upraised hand signal shall proceed to the nearest sidewalk or safety island in the direction of such signal while such steady upraised hand signal is showing.\n      � 2. This local law takes effect 90 days after it becomes law, except that the department of transportation may take such measures as are necessary for the implementation of this local law, including the promulgation of rules, prior to such date. \n      \nGZ/KET 5/17/16 9:40AM\nLS 5924\n      \n\n- 2 -",
