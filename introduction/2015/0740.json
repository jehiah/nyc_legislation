  "Summary": "The bill would require livery, black car, and luxury limousine bases to collect and electronically submit trip records to the Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). Such records would be required to include: 1) the date, time, and location of the pick-up and drop-off; 2) the driver’s TLC license number; 3) the dispatched vehicle’s TLC license number; 4) the TLC license number of the base that dispatched the vehicle; 5) the TLC license number of the for-hire affiliated to the dispatched vehicle; 6) the fare collected; and 7) whether the trip was in response to a request for a wheelchair accessible vehicle. Bases that fail to adhere to trip record requirements would be subject to civil penalties of $200 to $1,000 per record not collected and transmitted. The TLC would also be required to post on its website and submit to the Council summaries of such trip records biannually, beginning December 1, 2015.",
