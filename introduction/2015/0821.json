  "Summary": "Backflow is when drinking water is contaminated with non-drinkable water, predominately due to plumbing cross-connections. This local law would repeal Administrative Code § 24-343.1(d), relating to backflow prevention device reporting and certification, and replace it with a new subdivision d containing reporting requirements relating to backflow prevention devices. The new provision would require the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to report annually to the Council on the number of facilities and hazardous facilities estimated to require the installation of backflow prevention devices, the number of such facilities in which backflow prevention devices have already been installed, the number of test reports filed with DEP in the preceding year, and the number of violations issued for failure to install a backflow prevention device and for failure to file a required test report with DEP.",
