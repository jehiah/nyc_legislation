  "Summary": "This bill would require unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), including drones, to be registered with the New York City Department of Transportation (DOT) and to be covered by a liability insurance policy before they may be flown in City airspace. The bill would create exceptions from these requirements for toy aircraft (as defined in the bill), UAVs that are not flown in the City, and UAVs that are considered air carriers under federal law. The bill would also require each covered UAV to have a tag affixed to it with an identification number linking it to its owner. The bill would authorize DOT and other actors, including the Police Department, to enforce its provisions, and would allow authorized entities to temporarily seize a UAV that was in violation of the bill and allow DOT to impose penalties on the owner or operator after a hearing. Finally, the bill would allow the Commissioner of Transportation to promulgate rules and require him or her to report on the effectiveness of the registration and insurance requirements at protecting the public.",
