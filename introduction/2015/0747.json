  "Summary": "Various provisions in the New York City Charter (the “Charter”) prescribe the actions that need to be taken as part of the annual budget submission process during a fiscal year.  Such provisions also prescribe dates on which these actions must be taken.   This legislation would amend the Charter prescribed dates for Executive budget action. The new dates are as follows: \r\n\r\n1.   Mayor’s submission of the proposed executive budget and budget message no later than May 7, 2015.\r\n\r\n2.   Mayor’s submission of the Ten-Year Capital Strategy no later than May 7, 2015.\r\n\r\n3.

Completion of City Council’s executive budget hearings no later than June 15, 2015.\r\n\r\n6.   If an expense budget has not been adopted by June 16, 2015, the expense budget and tax rate adopted as modified for the current fiscal year shall be deemed to have been extended for the new fiscal year until such time as a new expense budget has been adopted.\r\n\r\n7.   If a capital budget and capital program have not been adopted by June 16, 2015, the unutilized portion of all prior capital appropriations shall be deemed reappropriated.\r\n\r\n8.   Mayor’s submission to Council of an estimate of probable amount of receipts no later than June 16, 2015.\r\n\r\n9.   Any person/organization’s submission of an official alternative estimate of revenues no later than May 26, 2015.\r\n\r\n10.  If the Council has not fixed the tax rates for the ensuing year on or before June 16, 2015, the Department of Finance is authorized to complete the rolls and collect property tax using estimated rates.\r\n\r\n11.  If the Council has not fixed the tax rates for ensuing fiscal year on or before June 16, 2015, the Council shall fix the tax rates for ensuing fiscal year at percentages differing from the estimated rates, and property tax payments shall be paid at the estimated rates. In this event DOF must revise the assessment roll before January 1st and send out an amended bill to reflect the tax rates fixed by the Council.",
