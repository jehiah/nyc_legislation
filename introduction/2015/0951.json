New multi-line phone systems within such agencies and businesses must be pre-configured to directly dial 911. \r\n\r\nThis law would also require that each such telephone system be configured to provide notification of a central location for which emergency personnel can respond to a 911 call placed on the telephone system.","TextID":59652,"Text":"Int.
