  "Summary": "The bill would prohibit the Taxi and Limousine Commission from restricting the acceptance of trip dispatches by for-hire vehicles from non-affiliated bases. However, bases would continue to be prohibited from “cross-dispatching” to vehicles of a different classification (i.e. a black car base may not dispatch a livery vehicle).",
