  "Summary": "This bill would mandate the suspension of a cigarette dealer license for any licensed cigarette dealer who violates the provisions of the proposed synthetic drug prohibition. It would create a mandatory revocation for a second violation of such proposed prohibition. It would allow the Department of Consumer Affairs commissioner to take such violations into account as they consider whether to grant future cigarette dealer licenses to such violator as well.",
