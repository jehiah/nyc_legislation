The RTEU is tasked with monitoring occupied multiple dwellings with permits for alteration of 10% or more of existing floor surface area of the building, or an addition to the building. The RTEU will also inspect immediately hazardous complaints related to work without a permit in occupied dwellings within 12 hours, and for all other complaints related to work without a permit in occupied dwellings, such inspections shall be conducted within ten days of receipt of the complaint. The RTEU shall also conduct initial inspections of 5% of occupied multiple dwellings with valid permits for an alteration or addition within 20 days of commencement of work.","TextID":60284,"Text":"Int.
