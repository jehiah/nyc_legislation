As part of the study, DOT would have to develop strategies to improve transit access to neighborhoods underserved by the subway system. Plans for transit improvement to serve areas identified as part of the study to be in need of transit access would include a variety of modes including light rail and subway. The study would be incorporated into the bus rapid transit plan required by Local Law 36 of 2015, which is due by September 1, 2017.","TextID":59458,"Text":"Int.
