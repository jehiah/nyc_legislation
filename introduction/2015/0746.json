  "Summary": "Title 20, Chapter 5, Subchapter 14 of the New York City Administrative Code regulates Immigration Assistance Service Providers. This bill would amend Subchapter 14 to impose stricter guidelines for providers and further protect customers against immigration services fraud and unauthorized practice of the law. Providers would be required to include specific language in their contracts related to the provider’s duties and limitations, as well as the customer’s rights. Additionally, providers would have to post required signage in English, as well as in any languages in which they provide or offer to provide services. Providers would be prohibited from offering and providing services that should only be provided by an attorney, and from making statements that could lead a customer to believe that the provider is an attorney or an immigration expert. Additionally, this bill would require that the Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA) provide periodic reports to the Council with information regarding the number, type, source and result of complaints against providers.",
