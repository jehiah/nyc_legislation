  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Correction (“DOC”) to issue a yearly report regarding the number and rate of inmates discharged to the community with mental health issues, and the number and rate at which these individuals are re-admitted to DOC custody within a year of their discharge. The bill also repeals a section of a local law passed in 2004 relating to discharge planning and applications for government benefits. This section permitted this law to be repealed at the DOC’s request if the Council did not renew the law within 1 year of such request.",
