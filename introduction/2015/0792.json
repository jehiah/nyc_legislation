To qualify for the rental subsidy a veteran would have to receive a disability pension from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or receive service-connected disability benefits from the VA at a 50 percent or higher disability rating. In addition, the veteran’s combined earned and unearned income could not exceed 200 percent of the federal poverty level and resources could not exceed the limit for public assistance recipients under New York State Law. Veterans who meet these qualifications would be required to pay no more than 30 percent of their monthly income toward their rent.","TextID":56042,"Text":"Int.
