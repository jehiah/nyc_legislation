  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to post a New York City map on its website of the clinics they run, comprehensive care and primary care facilities run by the Health and Hospitals Corporation, voluntary non-profit and publicly sponsored diagnostic and treatment centers, and federally qualified health centers. Included with the map would be a brief guide to how the facility types differ, and what factors may be relevant for members of the public in deciding which type of facility to access for their healthcare needs. This bill would also require that this map include data overlays by zip code that relate to healthcare services, including basic demographic information and health outcomes.",

The webpage that contains the map provided pursuant to subdivision a of this section, or a webpage available through a prominently displayed link on such webpage, shall include a brief guide in clearly understandable language describing each of the facility types included on such map and indicating how these types differ. Such guide shall include a brief description of the potential advantages and disadvantages that are most likely to be relevant to the individuals in determining which type of facility to choose to receive health care services.\n      c.
