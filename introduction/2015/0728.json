  "Summary": "This bill would require the New York City Police Department to publish its patrol guide online, excluding portions that would reveal non-routine investigative techniques or confidential information or that would compromise the safety of the public or police officers.  In addition, the bill would repeal a section of the administrative code related to the department’s submission of the NYPD patrol guide to the council.",
