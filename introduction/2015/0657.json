  "Summary": "This bill would codify in the Administrative Code the submission requirement that currently exists in the Health Code. It would require DOHMH to post documentation of annual inspections on its website and the City’s Open Data portal, to provide guidance on its site to assist users in determining whether a building is required to have a water tank inspection, and to post information on how to submit a complaint about a water tank or water from a water tank to DOHMH. This bill would also reinstate a lapsed requirement of annual reporting by DOHMH to the Council relating to water tank inspections, and introduce a new requirement that such reports include data on the number of inspection results received, including the number of received results that demonstrate compliance with the health-related requirements for water tanks.",
