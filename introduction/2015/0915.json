  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      Section 1. Subdivision c of section 23-502 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by a local law of the city of New York for the year 2015, in relation to the retention of data on the open data portal, as proposed in introduction number 890-A, is amended to read as follows: \n\tc. Such public data sets shall be updated as often as is necessary to preserve the integrity and usefulness of the data sets to the extent that the agency regularly maintains or updates the public data set. The department shall preserve row data that is subject to permanent removal or replacement and shall create and preserve archival copies, or an archival compilation data set with data indexed to its time of preservation, of public data sets in accordance with the technical standards manual published by the department pursuant to section 23-505. If any public data set is available on the single web portal and another website maintained by or on behalf of the city or a city agency, when such public data set is updated on such city or city agency website, such public data set shall also be updated on the single web portal within ten days in accordance with the technical standards published by the department pursuant to section 23-505; provided that if any such public data set receives automated updates on such city or city agency website, such public data set shall be updated on the single web portal within one day of any such automated update. If there is a public data set for which such update schedule regularly cannot be met, the agency that maintains such public data set shall report to the department the reasons why it cannot meet such update schedule and the date by which the agency expects that it will be able to meet such schedule, and such information shall be disclosed in the compliance plan prepared pursuant to section 23-506.\n\t� 2.
