  "Summary": "The bill requires heating oil sold or used in the City to contain: 5% biodiesel, by volume, starting October 1, 2017; 10%, starting October 1, 2025; 15%, starting October 1, 2030; 20%, starting October 1, 2034. The bill requires that, by 2020, the Administration must consult with, among others, representatives of the heating oil industry, the biodiesel industry, heating oil equipment manufacturers, and building owners and managers to conduct a survey identifying any commonly used heating oil equipment that might have a compatibility issue with using the required, higher-level biodiesel blends, and to make recommendations with respect to any such issues identified. NYCDEP will then be required to promulgate rules consistent with such recommendations, including exemptions or other special regulatory provisions for such equipment. The bill requires that, in 2023, DEP issue a report re-assessing whether there is sufficient biodiesel supply to meet the B10, B15, and B20 mandates identified in the bill. The bill expands waiver provisions already present in existing law (and adds new waiver provisions). For example, waivers would generally be available where NYCDEP determines that there is an insufficient supply of biodiesel to satisfy the relevant mandates, that the price of the required biodiesel blend significantly exceeds the price of oil, or where manufacturers of a particular boiler have noted that the boiler cannot accommodate a particular biodiesel blend without extensive modifications.",

The term \"heating oil\" means oil refined for the purpose of use as fuel for combustion in a heating system and that meets the specifications of ASTM designation D 396-12 or other specifications as determined by the commissioner.\n      [\"Heating system\" shall mean] Heating system. The term \"heating system\" means a system that generates heat, hot air, hot water or steam by combustion and distributes it within a building, provided that \"heating system\" shall not include wood burning stoves.\n      (b)(1) [After October 1, 2012, no] (i) No person shall cause or permit the use in any building in the city or [deliver] delivery to any building in the city for use in such building, heating oil that is fuel oil grade no. 2 [or no. 4 or residual fuel] if such heating oil contains: \n      (A) less than two percent biodiesel by volume, after October 1, 2012;\n      (B) less than five percent biodiesel by volume, on and after October 1, 2017;\n      (C) less than ten percent biodiesel by volume, on and after the later of October 1, 2025;\n      (D) less than fifteen percent biodiesel by volume, on and after the later of October 1, 2030; and\n      (E) less than twenty percent biodiesel by volume, on and after the later of October 1, 2034.\n      (ii) No person shall cause or permit the use in any building in the city or delivery to any building in the city for use in such building, heating oil that is fuel oil grade no. 4 if such heating oil contains:\n      (A) less than two percent biodiesel by volume, after October 1, 2012; and\n      (B) less than five percent biodiesel by volume, on and after October 1, 2017.\n      (iii) No person shall cause or permit the use in any building in the city or delivery to any building in the city for use in such building, heating oil that is residual fuel if such heating oil contains:\n      (A) less than two percent biodiesel by volume, after October 1, 2012; and\n      (B) less than five percent biodiesel by volume, on and after October 1, 2017.\n      (2) The provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to the use of heating oil or delivery of heating oil for use in [an]: \n      (i) An emergency generator [or for use in a]; \n      (ii) A boiler where heating oil from a dual-use tank supplies both such boiler and an emergency generator; or \n      (iii) A backup heating oil tank for a building that uses natural gas as the primary fuel where such heating oil contains greater than five percent biodiesel by volume.\n      [(2)] (3) (i) No later than January 1, 2020, an office or agency designated by the mayor shall submit to the mayor and speaker of the council, and make publicly available online the results of a survey seeking to identify commonly used heating oil equipment in the city that may encounter compatibility issues, including warranty issues, with the use of heating oil containing ten to twenty percent biodiesel by volume and (A) recommending that such equipment be exempted permanently or temporarily from the requirements of clause (C), (D) or (E) of subparagraph (i) of paragraph one of this subdivision, (B) recommending a waiver system for such equipment with respect to the requirements of such clauses or (C) recommending other safeguards or actions for such equipment with respect to the requirements of such clauses. In making such identifications and recommendations, such office or agency shall consult with other relevant offices or agencies, representatives of the heating oil industry, representatives of the biodiesel industry, heating oil equipment manufacturers, building owners and managers and any other person or group with expertise that could assist such office or agency in making such identifications and recommendations. While the survey may identify certain heating oil equipment that may encounter compatibility issues with the use of heating oil containing ten to twenty percent biodiesel by volume, the survey may not identify all heating oil equipment that may pose a risk of incompatibility. Compatibility issues should be addressed with individual manufacturers and the absence of heating oil equipment from the survey should not be construed to mean that the heating oil equipment does not have compatibility issues.
