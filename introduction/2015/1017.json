  "Summary": "This bill would establish and enhance protections for freelance workers. Specifically: the right to written contract, the right to be paid timely and in full and the right to be free of retaliation. The bill would create penalties for violations of these rights, including statutory damages, double damages, injunctive relief and attorney’s fees. Individual cause of action would be adjudicated in state court. Where there is evidence of a pattern or practice of violations, the Corporation Counsel may bring civil action to recover, on behalf of the City, civil penalty of not more than $25,000. This bill would also require the Office of Labor Standards (OLS) to receive complaints, create a navigation program, and to gather data and report on the effectiveness of the law.",

No provision of this chapter shall be construed as providing a determination about the legal classification of any individual as an employee or independent contractor.\n      � 20-936 Follow-up; data collection; reporting. a. No later than six months after the director sends to a freelance worker either a hiring party's response and accompanying materials or a notice of non-response pursuant to paragraph 2 or 3 of subdivision e of section 20-931, the director shall send the freelance worker a survey requesting additional information about the resolution of the freelance worker's claims. Such survey shall ask whether or not the freelance worker pursued any such claims in court or through an alternative dispute resolution process and whether or not the hiring party ultimately paid any or all of the compensation the freelance worker alleged was due or if the matter was resolved in a different manner.

Legislative recommendations for this chapter, including consideration of whether certain occupations should be exempted from the scope of the definition of freelance worker in section 20-927.\n      � 3.
