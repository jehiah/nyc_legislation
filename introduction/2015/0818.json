This bill allows the Human Rights Commission to award attorney’s fees in complaints brought before it. This bill also directs courts and the Human Rights Commission to base attorney’s fee awards on the hourly market-rate charged by attorneys of similar skill and experience practicing in New York County, which customarily has the highest attorney rates in New York City.","TextID":57337,"Text":"Int.

If, upon all the evidence at the hearing, and upon the findings of fact, conclusions of law and relief recommended by an administrative law judge, the commission shall find that a respondent has engaged in any unlawful discriminatory practice or any act of discriminatory harassment or violence as set forth in chapter six of this title, the commission shall state its findings of fact and conclusions of law and shall issue and cause to be served on such respondent an order requiring such respondent to cease and desist from such unlawful discriminatory practice or acts of discriminatory harassment or violence.
