This bill would amend the rights and responsibilities guide for tenants and owners, published by HPD in accordance with Local Law 45/2014, to include information regarding a tenant’s obligation to pay rent in cases where the owner is found to be violating the building’s certificate of occupancy.","TextID":55764,"Text":"Int.
