  "Summary": "This bill requires the NYPD to report on an annual basis on data relating to the property and money the department obtains possession of in the course of an arrest.  The bill requires the data be broken down to include the amount of money or the property obtained and retained, the reason why the property or money is being held by the department, and whether or not the rightful owners of the property or money have failed to redeem such money or property. Additionally, the bill requires the NYPD to report on any sale or disposition of money or property seized during an arrest that was retained by the Department. Finally, this bill would repeal a requirement to report on the disposition of certain unclaimed property.",
