Except as provided in paragraph c of this subdivision, for affected real property for which the assessed values on the assessment rolls completed in two thousand fourteen and two thousand fifteen do not reflect a physical increase, the amount of the aggregate physical increase shall not exceed the amount of the physical decrease reflected in the assessed value on the assessment roll completed in two thousand thirteen.
