  "Summary": "This bill would require the New York City Police Department to report on the number of criminal summonses and the number of summonses to appear in an authorized tribunal of the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings (“civil summons”), it issues each quarter. This information would be required to be broken down by the offense charged, the race, age and gender of the person to whom a summons was issued, and the borough and precinct in which the summons was issued. The bill would also require this information to be broken down by the criteria used to determine whether a civil or criminal summons was issued. Such criteria are required pursuant to Proposed Int. No. 1057-A.",
