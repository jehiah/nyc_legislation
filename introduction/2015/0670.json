  "Summary": "This bill would require that the City’s 311 website be modified so that it offers customers the option to create unique online customer accounts that would allow customers to store and track their 311 requests regardless of how such requests were submitted. Currently, the 311 mobile app allows customers to store and track 311 requests that were made using the mobile app only. The individualized customer accounts would allow customers to store and track 311 requests that were submitted via the 311 mobile app as well as requests submitted via the 311 website, via certain social media sites, by a phone call, or by any other approved methods.",
