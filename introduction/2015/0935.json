  "Summary": "The proposed bill would amend several paragraphs of Sections 126 and 128 of Title 21 of the Administrative Code, which are related to the Division of AIDS Services (otherwise known as the HIV/AIDS Services Administration or HASA). The proposed bill would require the Human Resources Administration (HRA) commissioner to consult with the Division’s advisory board before updating the Division’s policy and procedures manual and client bill of rights. The bill would allow the chairperson or five members of the advisory board to call a meeting and would require the board to produce annual reports. The bill would require HRA to post quarterly reports, the bill of rights, and annual reports of the advisory board online. The bill would also make non-substantive, technical amendments.",
