  "Summary": "This bill would require the New York City Police Department (NYPD) to report on hate crimes quarterly and annually on their website.  The data would be disaggregated by the animus towards a targeted group such as race, nationality, or sexual orientation and report on the demographics of the arrestee.  The Department would be required to further disaggregate certain categories if a particular group that is the target of the animus is targeted at least nine times in a total of four consecutive quarters.",
