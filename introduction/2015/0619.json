Currently, the Board consists of nine members, all of whom must be veterans. Five of the members are appointed by the Mayor, and four are appointed by the Speaker of the City Council. Members serve for three year terms. The Mayor and the Speaker are required to considered service in conflicts when making their appointments.\r\n\r\nThis bill would require the Board to meet a minimum of five times per year and to hold at least one meeting in each borough. The Board would be required to provide public notice of the meeting in compliance with New York State’s Public Officers Law. MOVA would be required to: 1) make all meetings of the Board open to the public; 2) post a notice on the office’s website of the date, time, and location of each meeting at least one week prior to the meeting; 3) maintain and update contact information for veterans organizations located within the city, and notify all of these organizations by regular or electronic mail of each Board meeting; and 4) record and broadcast all meetings on the internet.",

There shall be a veterans' advisory board consisting of nine members, all of whom shall be veterans, five of whom shall be appointed by the mayor and four of whom shall be appointed by the speaker of the council of the city of New York.  Of these nine appointees, there shall be one representative from each of the five boroughs of the city of New York. The mayor and the speaker shall each consider service in conflicts involving members of the United States armed forces when making such appointments.  All members shall serve for a term of three (3) years and may be removed by the appointing official for cause.
