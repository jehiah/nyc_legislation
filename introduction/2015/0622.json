  "Summary": "Recently, there have been a number of fatal child abuse incidents in New York city homeless shelters. Domestic violence also continues to be an issue in homeless shelters. This bill would require the Department of Homeless Services (DHS) to educate all new recipients of shelter on domestic violence and child abuse. Specifically, the bill would require DHS to provide to homeless persons undergoing intake educational materials, including a video and an illustrated brochure explaining what domestic violence and child abuse are.",
