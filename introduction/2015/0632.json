The department shall maintain confidential the identity of any complainant unless disclosure of such complainant's identity is necessary for resolution of the investigation or otherwise required by law. The department shall, to the extent practicable, notify such complainant that the department will be disclosing his or her identity prior to such disclosure.\r\n      (B) The department may, at any time after the filing of a complaint, resolve the complaint by any method of dispute resolution, unless such complaint is withdrawn by the complainant. \r\n      (C) The department shall keep complainants reasonably notified regarding the status of their complaint and any resultant investigation. \r\n      (D) A proceeding to recover any civil penalty authorized by this section shall be commenced by the service of a notice of violation which shall be returnable to the office of administrative tribunals and hearings. Such office shall have the power to impose the penalties described by paragraphs 1 through 5 of subdivision c of this section and by paragraph 3 of this subdivision.  \r\n      (E)  The department may settle a notice of violation at any time prior to the conclusion of an adjudication, provided that any complainant who opts out of such settlement may withdraw his or her complaint and file a private right of action pursuant to paragraph 2 of this subdivision.\r\n      2. Any eligible grocery employee alleging a violation of this section may bring a civil action against an incumbent grocery employer for a violation of paragraph 1 of subdivision b of this section or against a successor grocery employer for a violation of paragraphs 2 through 5 of subdivision b of this section only if:  \r\n      (A) such eligible grocery employee has filed a complaint with the department pursuant to paragraph 1 of this subdivision arising out of the same facts and circumstances, the department has not, within 120 days, either resolved such complaint or issued a notice of violation, and such employee has withdrawn such complaint with the department; or\r\n      (B) such eligible grocery employee has filed a complaint with the department pursuant to paragraph 1 of this subdivision arising out of the same facts and circumstances, has opted out of a settlement reached by the department pursuant to subparagraph (E) of paragraph 1 of this subdivision, and has withdrawn his or her complaint with the department.  \r\n      3. In addition to the penalties authorized by subdivision c of this section, the remedy in any administrative proceeding or civil action undertaken pursuant to this section may include: \r\n      (A) three times the pay for each day the eligible grocery employee was discharged or not retained in violation of paragraph 2 of subdivision b of this section, which shall be calculated at a rate of compensation not less than the higher of:\r\n      (i) the average regular rate of pay received by the eligible grocery employee during the last three years of such eligible grocery employee's employment in the same job category, or\r\n      (ii) the most recent regular rate received by the eligible grocery employee while employed by either the incumbent grocery employer or the successor grocery employer, regardless whether such employee obtained an alternate source of income that was less than, equal to, or greater than the rate calculated pursuant to this paragraph;\r\n      (B) the value of the benefits the eligible grocery employee would have received under the successor grocery employer's benefit plan for those days such employee was discharged or was not retained in violation of paragraph 2 of subdivision b of this section;\r\n      (C) an order requiring that the successor grocery employer retain its eligible grocery employees during the transitional employment period, unless an eligible grocery employee is discharged pursuant to paragraph 3 of subdivision b of this section or with cause; and\r\n      (D) reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred in maintaining a civil action for a violation of this section, provided the eligible grocery employee is the prevailing party in any such civil action.\r\n      e. The provisions of this section shall not apply to any successor grocery employer that, on or before the effective date of the transfer of control from a predecessor grocery employer to the successor grocery employer, enters into a collective bargaining agreement covering the eligible grocery employees or agrees to assume, or to be bound by, the collective bargaining agreement of the predecessor grocery employer covering the eligible grocery employees, provided that such collective bargaining agreement provides terms and conditions regarding the discharge or laying off of employees.\r\n      � 3. If any subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or other portion of this local law is, for any reason, declared unconstitutional or invalid, in whole or in part, by any court of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed severable and such unconstitutionality or invalidity shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of the local law that added this section, which remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect.\r\n      � 4. This local law shall take effect 90 days after it becomes law.\r\n \r\nMWC\r\nLS 2674\r\n1/11/16\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r- 2 -\r\r\n\r\n",
