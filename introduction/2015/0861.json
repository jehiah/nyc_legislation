  "Summary": "The bill would make the unlicensed operation of any vehicle as a commuter van punishable by a fine of $1,000-$2,000, imprisonment of up to 60 days, or both. In addition, the bill would set the minimum civil penalty for a first violation involving the operation of a commuter van to $1,000. Currently, the maximum penalty is $1,000, with no minimum. The civil penalty for a violation involving the operation of a commuter van service without the required authorizations or license would be raised from a range $500-$1,000 to $1,000-$3,000 for a first offense and $1,000-$2,500 to $2,000-$4,000 for subsequent offenses within two years.",
