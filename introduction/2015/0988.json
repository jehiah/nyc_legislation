  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection 1. Subdivision b of section 1052 of the New York city charter, as amended by local law number 43 for the year 2014, is amended to read as follows:\n      b. 1. The board shall take such actions as it deems necessary and appropriate to improve public awareness of the candidates, ballot proposals or referenda in all elections in which there are contested elections for the offices of mayor, public advocate, borough presidents, comptroller, or city council or ballot proposals or referenda pursuant to this charter or the municipal home rule law, including but not necessarily limited to the publication of a non-partisan, impartial [voters] voter guide in at least one media format providing information on candidates, ballot proposals and referenda, and the distribution of one copy of such guide to each household in which there is at least one registered voter eligible to vote in the election involved. A voter may opt out of receiving a printed copy of such guide and the board shall comply with this request to the extent feasible. \n      2. The board shall also take such actions as it deems necessary and appropriate to improve public awareness of the candidates in all other contested elections held in the city of New York for any city, county, state, or federal office or ballot proposals or referenda pursuant to city, county, state, or federal law, including but not necessarily limited to the publication of a non-partisan, impartial voter guide in at least one media format providing information on such candidates, ballot proposals or referenda.
