If the department concludes that such a program is feasible and would increase recycling rates, it must implement such a program by 2020 and report on its effectiveness and whether it should be made permanent after two years.","TextID":59152,"Text":"Int.

Subchapter 3 of chapter 3 of title 16 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 16-316.4 to read as follows:\n      16-316.4 Recycling incentive pilot program. a. On or before January 1, 2018, the department, in consultation with the New York city housing authority, shall perform and complete a review of voluntary recycling incentive pilot programs to improve the diversion of designated recyclable materials in public housing, as such term is defined in section 5.100 of title 24 of the code of federal regulations. Such review shall include, but need not be limited to, the following: (i) engaging public housing residents and other stakeholders to identify potential recycling incentive pilot programs and locations where it would be feasible to implement such programs; (ii) examining any potential obstacles to implementing such programs; (iii) exploring financial and other incentives that have been proposed or implemented in other jurisdictions and their potential to increase recycling participation by public housing residents; (iv) determining the steps necessary to implement a recycling incentive pilot program for public housing residents; and (v) prioritizing community districts that have comparatively low rates of recycling in public housing, as determined by the department. \n      b. On or before July 1, 2018, the department shall report to the mayor and the council and post on its website a summary of its review of voluntary recycling incentive pilot programs.

Within two years after implementation of such program, the department shall report to the mayor and the council, and post on its website, an assessment of the impact of such program on diversion rates.
