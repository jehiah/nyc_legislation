The bill would make technical amendments necessary for restructuring and modernizing the language in the HRL, as well as changes clarifying the scope of the law’s protections for victims of domestic violence, sex offenses and stalking. The bill would move certain definitions into and out of section 8-102 of the Code and would apply a uniform style to the definitions section. The bill would also amend the Charter provisions setting forth the Human Rights Commission’s powers: consolidating duplicative provisions and repealing them from the Code, clarifying existing enforcement authority and amending the annual report due date. Additionally, the bill would move Chapters 8-11 of Title 8 to more subject-matter appropriate titles. Finally, the bill would update cross-references in other provisions of the Code to reflect the structural amendments to Title 8.","TextID":60873,"Text":"Int.

Chapter 9 of title 8 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 73 for the year 2000, is re-designated as a new chapter 11 of title 10 of the administrative code of the city of New York and amended to read as follows:\n[CHAPTER 9]CHAPTER 11\nACTIONS BY VICTIMS OF GENDER-MOTIVATED VIOLENCE\n      [� 8-901]� 10-1101 Short [Title]title. This [local law]chapter shall be known and may be cited as the \"Victims of Gender-Motivated Violence Protection [Act.\"]Law\".\n      [� 8-902]� 10-1102 Declaration of [Legislative Findings and Intent]legislative findings and intent. Gender-motivated violence inflicts serious physical, psychological, emotional and economic harm on its victims. Congressional findings have documented that gender-motivated violence is widespread throughout the United States, representing the leading cause of injuries to women ages 15 to 44. Further statistics have shown that three out of four women will be the victim of a violent crime sometime during their lives, and as many as [four million]4,000,000 women a year are victims of domestic violence. Senate hearings, various task forces and the United States [Department]department of [Justice]justice have concluded that victims of gender-motivated violence frequently face a climate of condescension, indifference and hostility in the court system and have documented the legal system's hostility towards sexual assault and domestic violence claims. Recognizing this widespread problem, [Congress]congress in 1994 provided victims of gender-motivated violence with a cause of action in federal court through the [Violence Against Women Act]violence against women act (VAWA) ([42 USC � 13981] section 13981 of title 42 of the United States code). In a May 15, 2000, decision, the United States [Supreme Court]supreme court held that the [Constitution]constitution provided no basis for a federal cause of action by victims of gender-motivated violence against [their]perpetrators of offenses committed against them either under the[ Commerce Clause or the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment] commerce clause or the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment. In so ruling, the [Court]court held that it could \"think of no better example of the police power, which the Founders denied the National Government and reposed in the States, than the suppression of violent crime and vindication of its victims.\"\n      In light of the void left by the [Supreme Court's]supreme court's decision, this [Council]council finds that victims of gender-motivated violence should have a private right of action against [their] perpetrators of offenses committed against them under the [Administrative Code]administrative code. This private right of action aims to resolve the difficulty that victims face in seeking court remedies by providing an officially sanctioned and legitimate cause of action for seeking redress for injuries resulting from gender-motivated violence.\n      [� 8-903]� 10-1103 Definitions. [For purposes of]As used in this chapter, the following terms have the following meanings: \n      [a. \"Crime of violence\"]Crime of violence. The term \"crime of violence\" means an act or series of acts that would constitute a misdemeanor or felony against the person as defined in state or federal law or that would constitute a misdemeanor or felony against property as defined in state or federal law if the conduct presents a serious risk of physical injury to another, whether or not those acts have actually resulted in criminal charges, prosecution, or conviction.\n      [b. \"Crime of violence motivated by gender\"]Crime of violence motivated by gender. The term \"crime of violence motivated by gender\" means a crime of violence committed because of gender or on the basis of gender, and due, at least in part, to an animus based on the victim's gender.\n      [� 8-904]� 10-1104 Civil [Cause of Action]cause of action.

Gender-motivated violence inflicts serious physical, psychological, emotional and economic harm on its victims. Congressional findings have documented that gender-motivated violence is widespread throughout the United States, representing the leading cause of injuries to women ages 15 to 44. Further statistics have shown that three out of four women will be the victim of a violent crime sometime during their lives, and as many as [four million]\\ul 4,000,000\\ulnone  women a year are victims of domestic violence.
