Currently, SBS and MOCS submit within their annual M/WBE report a list of all solicitations sent to the city chief procurement officer for review, and a summary of the determination made whether to divide the proposed contract. This bill would require more detailed information about how this determination was made.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the bill would change the dates by which each agency must submit their M/WBE utilization plan (from April 1 to July 31), anticipated contracting schedule (from July 31 to June 30), and performance improvement plan (in cases where the agency failed to achieve its utilization goals) (from October 1 to January 31). Finally, the bill would remove dollar limitations on the purchases of goods for which agencies have to submit an MWBE utilization plan.","TextID":58270,"Text":"Int.
