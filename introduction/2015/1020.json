  "Summary": "Under local law, prior to soliciting bids or proposals for contracts valued at over ten million dollars (other than contracts for capital projects valued at over twenty-five million dollars and certain contracts that are otherwise exempt), agencies must submit the bid or proposal to the city’s chief procurement officer for a determination whether it is practicable to divide the proposed contract into smaller contracts and whether doing so would enhance competition for such contracts among minority-owned business enterprises (MBEs), women-owned business enterprises (WBEs) and emerging business enterprises (EBEs), and other potential bidders or proposers. Currently, SBS and MOCS submit within their annual M/WBE report a list of all solicitations sent to the city chief procurement officer for review, and a summary of the determination made whether to divide the proposed contract. This bill would require more detailed information about how this determination was made.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the bill would change the dates by which each agency must submit their M/WBE utilization plan (from April 1 to July 31), anticipated contracting schedule (from July 31 to June 30), and performance improvement plan (in cases where the agency failed to achieve its utilization goals) (from October 1 to January 31). Finally, the bill would remove dollar limitations on the purchases of goods for which agencies have to submit an MWBE utilization plan.",
