  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection 1. Subdivision 20 of section 3-702 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by a local law for the year 2016 amending the administrative code of the city of New York relating to the viewing of dates from the doing business database, as proposed in introduction number 1361, is amended to read as follows:\n      20. The term \"doing business database\" means a computerized database accessible to the board that contains the names of persons who have business dealings with the city; provided, however that for purposes of this chapter the doing business database shall not be required to contain the names of any person whose business dealings with the city are solely of a type for which the board has not certified that such database includes the names of those persons engaged in such type of business dealings with the city. Such database shall be developed, maintained and updated by the office of the mayor in a manner so as to ensure its reasonable accuracy and completeness; provided, however, that in no event shall such database be updated less frequently than once a month. Such computerized database shall contain a function to enable members of the public to determine if a given person is in the database because such person has business dealings with the city and the date a person is considered doing business with the city pursuant to paragraph d of subdivision 18 of this section. A searchable list of persons removed from such computerized database, pursuant to paragraph c of subdivision 18 of this section, within the preceding five years, including the date the persons were considered doing business with the city and the date of removal from such computerized database, shall also be made available on the city's website.
