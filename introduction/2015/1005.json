The utilization plan details the M/WBE participation goals set by the contracting agency. Upon approval from SBS, the agency must then submit a copy of the utilization plan to the Speaker of the Council. This bill would require that these plans are also posted online for public access.","TextID":58268,"Text":"Int.
