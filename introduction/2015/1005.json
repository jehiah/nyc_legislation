  "Summary": "Currently, each agency that made more than $5 million in procurements in the previous fiscal year is required to submit a utilization plan for the following fiscal year to the Department of Small Business Services (SBS). The utilization plan details the M/WBE participation goals set by the contracting agency. Upon approval from SBS, the agency must then submit a copy of the utilization plan to the Speaker of the Council. This bill would require that these plans are also posted online for public access.",
