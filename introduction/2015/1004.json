The amendments in this local law would add some titles to the types of employees covered (including security officers and fire safety director), change the definition of employer to include tenants and amends the law to include insourcing and amends the remedies available if there is a dispute, including adding liquidated damages and reinstatement.","TextID":57604,"Text":"Int.
