  "Summary": "Recent media reports have documented instances of drivers receiving multiple summonses for driving in a designated bus lane. It appears that some of the drivers may not have been aware of the existence of the bus lane, and it some cases accumulated summonses in the hundreds of dollars. Thus, this law would not permit the issuance of more than one bus lane infraction within one hour period.",
