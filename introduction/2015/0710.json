  "Summary": "This bill adds notice requirements with respect to an owner’s right of access. Specifically, this bill requires an owner to provide a tenant with written notice before entering such tenant’s dwelling unit for inspections or repairs or improvements. The bill requires notice to be delivered by personal delivery and email, if the tenant has provided the owner with an email address, at least 72 hours before making an inspection and 14 calendar days before making repairs or improvements or doing other work within the dwelling unit. The notice period is waived if the tenant gives consent that the owner may enter the dwelling unit at an earlier time or if the repair, improvement or work is being done at the request of the tenant. \r\n\r\nThe bill also prescribes the content of the notice. The notice must be dated and include the date and the time that the owner wishes to enter the dwelling unit, a contact phone number for the owner, the name of the person delivering the notice, a statement of the reason for entering the dwelling unit, and a statement that the tenant can waive the notice period. The bill requires such notice to be in English and Spanish, and another language if the tenant cannot meaningfully communicate in either English or Spanish.",

No tenant shall refuse to permit the owner, or his or her agent or employee, to enter such tenant's dwelling unit or other space under his or her control to make repairs or improvements required by this code or other law or to inspect such apartment or other space to determine compliance with this code or any other provision of law, if the right  of entry is exercised at a reasonable time, [and] in  a  reasonable  manner and after provision of notice pursuant to subdivision b and c of this section, if applicable, provided that the owner shall accommodate reasonable requests to reschedule such entry.  The department may by rule or regulation restrict the time and manner of such inspections.\n\tb. In addition to any rules or regulations promulgated by the department pursuant to this section, an owner shall provide a tenant with written notice before entering such tenant's dwelling unit, except in cases of emergency as defined by rules of the department.

Where such entry is for the purpose of making repairs or improvements or doing other work within such dwelling unit, such notice shall be delivered by personal delivery and electronic mail, if such tenant has provided the owner with an electronic mail address, at least fourteen days before such entry. The required notice period is waived if (1) such tenant gives consent that the owner may enter the dwelling unit at a date and time prior to the expiration of the notice period or (2) such repair, improvement or other work is being done at the request of such tenant.\n      c.
