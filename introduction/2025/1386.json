  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation to ensure that all street furniture, whose maintenance it is responsible for, be repaired or replaced within 3 months of the date when it receives notice that the street furniture is damaged or missing. The bill would also require City agencies to include a provision within contracts with outside entities that are responsible for street furniture to ensure that street furniture is repaired or replaced within the same time frame.",
