  "Summary": "This bill would extend the current moratorium on fines related to violations of local laws and regulations governing signs on awnings and accessory signs, which are typically signs which promote a business and are attached to the building in which the business operates. This moratorium would only apply to violations that do not pose hazards to health or safety. This bill would also require the Department of Buildings and the Department of Small Business Services to provide education and outreach concerning the laws and regulations governing such signs, so as to assist with compliance by small businesses, sign makers, and sign hangers.",
