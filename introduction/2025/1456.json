  "Summary": "This bill would extend the current moratorium on fines related to violations of local laws and regulations governing signs on awnings and accessory signs for three years. Accessory signs and awnings are typically signs which promote a business and are attached to the building in which the business operates, with awnings projecting outward from the building. This bill would also make the moratorium apply to awnings and accessory signs installed before February 2025. This moratorium would only apply to violations that do not pose hazards to health or safety. Alongside the moratorium, DOB’s assistance program, which provides eligible business owners with technical assistance in acquiring permits to replace noncompliant signs and waives the relevant permit fees, would be continued by three years. This bill would also require the Department of Buildings and the Department of Small Business Services to provide education and outreach concerning the laws and regulations governing such signs, so as to assist with compliance by small businesses, sign makers, and sign hangers and to ensure small businesses are aware of the licensed professionals who can safely install awning and accessory signs.",
