  "Summary": "This bill would set a target, measured in greened acres, of stormwater managed by green infrastructure in the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) area. This bill would require the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to install, or cause to be installed, green infrastructure projects to meet such target. The bill would also require DEP to publish an annual greened acre report until such target is met. Finally, the bill would require DEP to measure all of the city’s green infrastructure projects in greened acres, and publish those greened acre measurements for each green infrastructure project on the green infrastructure program map.",

The term \"green infrastructure asset\" includes any green infrastructure project designed and maintained by the department, or any other agency, and any green infrastructure project funded by the department's green infrastructure grant program.\n      Greened acre. The term \"greened acre\" means the volume of stormwater managed by a green infrastructure asset equivalent to 1 inch of stormwater over 1 acre of impervious area. \n      MS4 area. The term \"MS4 area\" means areas of the city served by separate storm sewers and separate stormwater outfalls owned or operated by the city; areas served by separate storm sewers owned or operated by the city that connect to combined sewer overflow pipes downstream of the regulator owned or operated by the city; and areas in which municipal operations and facilities drain by overland flow to waters of the state of New York. \n      b.
