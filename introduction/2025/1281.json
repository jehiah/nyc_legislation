  "Summary": "Local law 157 of 2016 required the installation of natural gas alarms in dwelling units on May 1 of the year after the department establishes applicable standards and rules for those alarms. This bill would postpone the natural gas alarm requirement and would instead provide that natural gas alarms be required no earlier than January 1, 2027. DOB would also be required to submit to the mayor and the Council, by July 1, 2026, a determination on if the department has been able to identify 4 distinct manufacturers of battery-powered natural gas alarms; if such determination finds an insufficient number of alarms, DOB would be required to extend the compliance date  to January 1, 2029.",
