  "Summary": "Local law 157 of 2016 required the installation of natural gas alarms in dwelling units on May 1 of the year after the department establishes applicable standards and rules for those alarms. This bill would postpone that mandate and would instead provide that natural gas alarms will be required one year after the department of buildings determines that natural gas alarms are sufficiently available and affordable, but no earlier than January 1, 2027.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Subparagraph c of paragraph 1 of subdivision b of section 27-2045(b)(1)(c), as added by local law number 157 for the year 2016, is amended to read as follows:\n      [Provide] One year after the commissioner of buildings makes a determination that such devices are sufficiently available and affordable pursuant to section 28-315.2.4.1 of the administrative code, and no earlier than January 1, 2027, provide and install one or more approved and operational natural gas detecting devices in accordance with [section 908.10] section 908.13 of the New York city building code or section [28-315.2.3] 28-315.2.4 of the code, as applicable, or, in the alternative for class B multiple dwellings, provide and install a line-operated zoned natural gas detecting system with central annunciation and central office tie-in for all public corridors and public spaces, pursuant to rules promulgated by the commissioner of buildings or by the commissioner in consultation with the department of buildings and the fire department;\n      � 2.

In determining whether the devices are sufficiently available and affordable, the commissioner shall consider whether a sufficient number of natural gas detectors are readily available for purchase in relation to the expected needs of all dwelling units for which they are required, and whether purchasing natural gas detectors would present a reasonable likelihood of creating an undue financial burden on owners of those units in view of compliance costs and the expenses incurred by owners of dwelling units.\n      � 3. Section 8 of local law 157 for the year 2016 is REPEALED.\n      � 4.
