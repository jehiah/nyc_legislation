DOB would also be required to submit to the mayor and the Council, by July 1, 2026, a determination on if the department has been able to identify 4 distinct manufacturers of battery-powered natural gas alarms; if such determination finds an insufficient number of alarms, DOB would be required to extend the compliance date  to January 1, 2029.",
