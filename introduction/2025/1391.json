Education and outreach conducted by the department; and\n      8. Any other information the department deems appropriate.\n      � 20-1609 Recordkeeping. a.

A covered security employer must maintain records in their original format and provide such records to the department in their original format or a machine-readable electronic format as set forth in rules of the department.\n      b. The failure of a covered security employer to maintain, retain, or produce a record or other information required to be maintained by this chapter and requested by the department in furtherance of an investigation conducted pursuant to this chapter that is relevant to a material fact alleged by the department in a notice of violation issued pursuant to this subchapter creates a rebuttable presumption that such fact is true.\n      � 20-1610 Notice of rights. a. On or before September 15, 2026, the commissioner shall publish and make available template notices for covered security employers to provide to covered security guards and post in worksites, informing them of their right to the standard wage, standard benefits supplement, and standard paid time off, as well as the rates and effective dates for each; covered security guards' right to receive free training by a certified training program and to be paid for time spent in the training; covered security guards' right to be free from retaliation; covered security guards' right to file a complaint with the department; and the contact information for the department where questions about rights and responsibilities under this chapter can be answered. Such notices shall be made available in a downloadable format on the city's website in accordance with the requirements for language access as described in chapter 11 of title 23. The commissioner shall update such notices if any changes are made to the requirements of this chapter or as otherwise deemed appropriate by the commissioner.\n      � 20-1611 Anti-Retaliation. a. No person shall take any adverse action against a covered security guard that penalizes such covered security guard for or is reasonably likely to deter such covered security guard from, exercising or attempting to exercise any right protected under this chapter. Taking an adverse action includes threatening, intimidating, disciplining, discharging, demoting, suspending or harassing an employee, reducing the hours or pay of a covered security guard, transferring a security guard to a less desirable worksite, informing another covered security employer that a covered security guard has engaged in activities protected by this chapter, and discriminating against the covered security guard, including actions related to perceived immigration status or work authorization status. Adverse action shall also include interfering with or punishing an individual for in any manner participating in or assisting an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this chapter, or willfully preventing or attempting to prevent an individual from securing other employment by word, writing, or any other action. An employee need not explicitly refer to this chapter or the rights enumerated herein to be protected from retaliation.\n      b. As used in this section, to threaten, penalize, or in any other manner discriminate or retaliate against any covered security guard includes threatening to contact or contacting United States immigration authorities or otherwise reporting or threatening to report a covered security guard suspected citizenship or immigration status or the suspected citizenship or immigration status of a covered security guard family or household member to a federal, state or local agency.\n      c. The termination or other disciplinary action taken by a covered security employer against a covered security guard within 90 days of the covered security guard's exercise of rights under this section, assisting any other person in doing so, or informing any person about their rights, shall raise a rebuttable presumption of having done so in retaliation for the exercise of those rights.\n      � 20-1612 Enforcement and penalties. a. The department shall enforce the provisions of this chapter. In effectuating such enforcement, the department shall establish a system utilizing multiple means of communication to receive complaints regarding non-compliance with this chapter and investigate complaints received by the department in a timely manner.\n      b. Any covered security guard, former covered security guard, group of covered security guards, and/or labor union or other organization assisting covered security guards that alleges a violation of this chapter shall have the right to file a complaint with the department within six years of the date they knew or should have known of the alleged violation.\n      c. The department may open an investigation on its own initiative.\n      d. The statute of limitations for bringing a civil action shall be tolled during any investigation of a covered security employer by the department.  \n      e. The department shall keep the identity of any complainant confidential unless disclosure of such complainant's identity is necessary for resolution of the investigation or otherwise required by law. The department shall, to the extent practicable, notify such complainant that the department will be disclosing his or her identity prior to such disclosure.\n      f. Upon receiving a complaint alleging a violation of this chapter, the department shall investigate such complaint. The department shall keep complainants reasonably notified regarding the status of their complaint and any resultant investigation. If the department believes that a violation has occurred, it shall issue to the offending person or entity a notice of violation. The commissioner shall prescribe the form and wording of such notices of violation. The notice of violation shall be returnable to the administrative tribunal authorized to adjudicate violations of this chapter.\n      g. The department shall have the power to impose penalties provided for in this chapter and to grant a covered security guard or former covered security guard all appropriate relief. Such relief shall include: the full amount of any underpayments, including interest thereon, and an additional amount equal to twice the underpaid wages and/or benefits as liquidated damages. Relief may additionally include reinstatement and other compensatory damages or equitable relief, injunctive and/or declaratory relief.\n      h. Any entity or person found to be in violation of this chapter shall be liable for a civil penalty payable to the city not to exceed five hundred dollars for the first violation and, for subsequent violations that occur within two years of any previous violation, not to exceed seven hundred and fifty dollars for the second violation and not to exceed one thousand dollars for each succeeding violation. The penalties imposed pursuant to this subdivision shall be imposed on a per security guard and per instance basis for each violation.\n      i. If the department attempts to negotiate a settlement with a covered security employer to resolve a claim, it shall keep the complainant(s) reasonably notified regarding the status of settlement discussions.\n      � 20-1613 Enforcement by corporation counsel. a. The corporation counsel or such other persons designated by the corporation counsel on behalf of the department may initiate in any court of competent jurisdiction any action or proceeding that may be appropriate or necessary for correction of any violation issued pursuant to section 20-1611, including actions to secure permanent injunctions, enjoining any acts or practices that constitute such violation, mandating compliance with the provisions of this chapter, or such other relief as may be appropriate.\n      � 20-1614 Enforcement by corporation counsel for pattern or practice of violations. a. Cause of action. 1. Where reasonable cause exists to believe that a covered security employer is engaged in a pattern or practice of violations of this chapter, the corporation counsel or such other persons designated by the corporation counsel may commence a civil action on behalf of the city in a court of competent jurisdiction.\n      2. The corporation counsel or such other persons designated by the corporation counsel shall commence such action by filing a complaint setting forth facts relating to such pattern or practice and requesting relief, which may include injunctive relief, civil penalties and any other appropriate relief.\n      b.
