  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Chapter 1 of title 30 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 30-117 to read as follows:\n      � 30-117 Uniform emergency response maps. a. For purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings:\n      Approved mapping organization. The term \"approved mapping organization\" means an entity approved by the commissioner pursuant to subdivision e of this section to prepare and verify uniform emergency response maps.\n      Authorized agency. The term \"authorized agency\" means a city, state, or federal agency or office authorized by the commissioner pursuant to subdivision d of this section to access and use the uniform emergency response maps.\n      City property. The term \"city property\" means real property, including buildings and structures thereon, leased as lessee or owned by the city that serves a city governmental purpose over which the city has operational control.\n      Designated city property. The term \"designated city property\" means city property, or a portion thereof, designated for compliance with this section by the commissioner pursuant to subdivision c of this section.\n      Uniform emergency response map. The term \"uniform emergency response map\" means a map required by this section and includes the data underlying such map unless otherwise expressly indicated.\n      b. 1. When promulgating rules or otherwise taking action under this section, the commissioner shall consult, to the extent practicable, with the fire department, the police department, the department of citywide administrative services, and any other relevant agency. Each such agency or office shall cooperate with the commissioner as necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.\n      2. The commissioner may consult with and engage such external technical experts as the commissioner deems necessary and appropriate to carry out the requirements of this section.\n      c. 1. By no later than 1 year after the effective date of the local law that added this section, and from time to time thereafter, the commissioner shall designate city properties for compliance with this section and establish timeframes for achieving such compliance.\n      2. The commissioner shall, to the extent practicable, ensure that, by no later than 2 years after the effective date of the local law that added this section, all city properties have become designated city properties and have complied with the requirements of this section except as provided in paragraphs 3 and 4 of this subdivision.\n      3. The commissioner may exempt city property from compliance with this section if the commissioner determines that, based upon the location, use, or occupancy of such property or other factors prescribed by the commissioner, compliance with this section would be impracticable or unduly burdensome and public safety would not be substantially jeopardized if such property did not comply with this section. The commissioner may at any time thereafter rescind such exemption and designate such property in accordance with paragraph 1 of this subdivision.\n      4. For real property that becomes a city property on or after July 1, 2026, the commissioner shall, to the extent practicable, ensure that such property becomes a designated city building and complies with this section within one year after becoming a city property unless such property is exempted pursuant to paragraph 3 of this subdivision.\n      d. The commissioner shall authorize the office of emergency management, the fire department, the police department, the New York state police, the United States federal bureau of investigation, and such other city, state, or federal public safety agencies or offices as the commissioner determines to be appropriate, to access and use the uniform emergency response maps.\n      e. The commissioner shall approve organizations to serve as approved mapping organizations, provided that an organization shall not be so approved unless the organization shows to the satisfaction of the commissioner that it: \n      1. Has for at least 6 years been in the business of preparing and verifying indoor emergency response maps that are similar to the uniform emergency response maps required by this section; and\n      2. Has prepared and verified indoor emergency response maps similar to the uniform emergency response maps required by this section for at least 15,000 properties, including at least one property in the city.\n      f. All work relating to the preparation and verification of uniform emergency response maps by an approved mapping organization shall be done by individuals who are directly employed by such organization and who have undergone a background check performed by or on behalf of such organization.\n      g. For each designated city property, the agency to which such property is assigned as identified pursuant to section 4-208 shall ensure that a uniform emergency response map is prepared in accordance with this section.\n      h. The uniform emergency response map for a designated city property shall comply with requirements that the commissioner shall prescribe by rule. In addition to any other requirements that the commissioner determines to be necessary and appropriate, such rules shall require that such map:\n      1. Be prepared and maintained in formats that:\n      (a) Conform to and integrate with emergency response software platforms and other applicable technology platforms used by the authorized agencies in public safety answering systems, operations centers, real-time crime centers, vehicle devices, and mobile devices;\n      (b) Allow each such agency to use such platforms to access, view, share, and, where applicable, print such map without requiring such agency to purchase additional hardware or software or pay a fee for viewing, accessing, sharing, or printing such map; provided that the requirements of this paragraph shall not be considered satisfied if such map can only be accessed, viewed, shared, or printed through a web browser; and\n      (c) Does not allow subsequent modifications or updates to such map except in accordance with subdivision i of this section;\n      2. Be verified for accuracy in a manner prescribed by the commissioner, provided that such verification shall include an onsite inspection and complete walkthrough of the designated city property by the approved mapping organization;\n      3. Be oriented to true north;\n      4. Include a gridded overlay with an xy-coordinate system and, for each floor of each building or structure on such property, include z-axis elevation data;\n      5. Include accurate floor plans overlaid on current aerial imagery of such property, verified by the approved mapping organization;\n      6. Include site-specific labeling identifying elements physically located on or at such property, including room labels, hallway names, external door or stairwell numbers, and the location of hazards, key utility locations, key boxes, automated external defibrillators, and trauma kits;\n      7. Include site-specific labeling identifying the layout and surrounds of such property, including alleyways, sidewalks, parking areas, and surrounding roads, parks, and other notable infrastructure; and\n      8. Include relevant contextual information about such property that may assist in an emergency, including, for each building or structure on such property, the building information number, age of the structure, number of floors, number of elevators, approximate occupancy, and geospatial coordinates.\n      i. The commissioner shall by rule establish procedures for updating or otherwise modifying a uniform emergency response map, provided that such rules shall ensure that:\n      1. Such updates or modifications are uniformly made to such map wherever they may be stored or accessed such that, at all relevant times, authorized agencies shall have access to the most current and accurate version thereof without requiring such agencies to pay any fee therefor; and\n      2. All previous versions of such map are clearly identified as such and remain perpetually available to authorized agencies without requiring such agencies to pay any fee therefor.\n      � 2. This local law shall take effect immediately.\n\nLS #19028\n04/02/25 3:00 pm\n\n\n      2\n      \n      \n      6",
