  "Summary": "This bill would require the taxi and limousine commission, in collaboration with the police department and department of transportation, to develop and maintain a checklist of applicable rules and regulations that relate to unlicensed commuter vans. This checklist would be utilized in the training of officers authorized to enforce the commission’s rules, as well as during enforcement actions against unlicensed commuter vans. In addition, the taxi and limousine commission would be required to conduct no fewer than six operations each quarter to inspect routes used by unlicensed commuter vans in order to identify potential violations of the commission’s rules and regulations.",
