  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation (DOT) to install at least 5,000 bicycle parking stations over five years at a rate of 1,000 per year. At least 400 stations must be installed on commercial blocks per year. When placing the stations DOT must consider a few factors, such as whether certain communities are underserved by biking infrastructure, whether there are nearby bicycle lanes, whether an enclosed station is appropriate, whether a station may help alleviate sidewalk congestion, and whether there are community partners willing to assist with the station’s upkeep. DOT must also solicit and consider input from entities that might be interested in station placement. DOT must post the locations of its parking stations on its website. Finally, within six years after the law’s effective date, DOT must submit a one-time report to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council analyzing the status of its bicycle parking station program and post the report online.",
