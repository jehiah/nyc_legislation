  "Summary": "This bill would reform many of the city’s business licensing laws. It would merge the electronics store and the electronic or home appliance service dealer licenses. Individual locksmiths would no longer need to be licensed or fingerprinted, and the fingerprinting requirement would also be eliminated for process servers and dealers in secondhand goods (other than automobile dealers). Secondhand clothing dealers and distributors for general vendors would no longer be required to be licensed. Process servers, industrial laundries, dealers in secondhand goods (other than automobile dealers), and storage warehouses would no longer be required to be bonded. It would eliminate fees for replacing lost or destroyed licenses. Finally, licensed electronic cigarette dealers would be permitted to move within their community districts without applying for a new license.",
