  "Summary": "This bill would reform many of the city’s business licensing laws. It would merge the electronics store and the electronic or home appliance service dealer licenses. Individual locksmiths and manufacturers of locks would no longer need to be licensed. The fingerprinting requirement would be eliminated for process servers, dealers in secondhand goods and locksmiths. Secondhand clothing dealers and distributors for general vendors would no longer be required to be licensed. Process servers, industrial laundries, and dealers in secondhand goods would no longer be required to execute a surety bond. This bill would also eliminate fees for replacing lost or destroyed licenses.",
