  "Summary": "This bill would amend the annual disclosure law to affect the bands a New York City officer, employee, candidate for office, or political party official selects when disclosing anything with a monetary value or amount. There are currently seven bands one may choose from when it comes to disclosure. The bill would set these bands to $1000 to $5000, $5000 to $64,000, $64,000 to $150,000, $150,000 to $250,000, $250,000 to $500,000, $500,000 to $1,000,000, and any amount over $1,000,000. While the bill may have an effect on which band an officer or employer discloses in, it does not affect the number of people who must disclose, nor does it affect which people must disclose.",
