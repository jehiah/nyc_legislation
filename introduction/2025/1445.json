  "Summary": "This bill would update the asset inventory management report to require disclosure of additional information about the City’s infrastructure and its maintenance. This bill would also require that the Design and Development Corporation (DDC) work with registered architects or engineers to provide centralized guidance for agencies to use when conducting inspections along with an inspection schedule. This information would be publicly posted in a machine readable format. The cost estimate for the required maintenance would be prepared by DDC and would be considered by OMB and the Department of City Planning when they prepare the City’s 10-year capital plan. The bill would also require DDC to create an advanced capital planning tool that would be used to recommend necessary capital projects.",

Such information shall be categorized by project type and shall denote when such asset is part of a campus or larger facility.  \n      c. Not later than October [first of nineteen hundred ninety] 1, 1990, the head of each agency shall submit to the mayor an agency capital plant inventory presenting, for each major portion of the capital plant for which the agency or any officer or employee thereof is responsible, an update of the information required by subdivision b of this section as well as an assessment of its condition and a schedule, by year, of maintenance activities. The head of each agency shall submit amendments of such agency capital plant inventory to the mayor as necessary to ensure that such inventory, including the condition assessments and maintenance schedules, is complete, current and accurate. Such inventory and amendments thereto shall be categorized by project type.\n      d.

The mayor shall transmit copies of such agency capital plant inventories, and all amendments thereto, to the council, the comptroller and the city planning commission and shall ensure that all information from such inventories as amended, including the condition assessments and maintenance schedules, and the opinions and recommendations related to such maintenance schedules are centrally stored and accessible to such officials, the agencies involved and [other interested parties] publicly posted on the website of the department of design and construction in a machine-readable format.\n      f.

Such estimates shall be prepared [or reviewed] by the department of design and construction and professional engineers or architects who prepared or reviewed such maintenance schedules or by professional engineers or architects registered in the State of New York and employed by the [office of management and budget]city of New York, in consultation with [or] the agencies involved. Such architects or engineers shall set forth in writing:\n      [(1)]1.
