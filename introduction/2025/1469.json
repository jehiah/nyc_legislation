  "Summary": "This bill would require the Commissioner of Transportation to conduct a study on the feasibility of permitting motorists to make a right turn at a red signal following a complete stop at each intersection with a traffic control signal on Staten Island. The Commissioner would have to consider a number of factors in the study, such as geometric constraints involving corner sight distance and the turning patterns of larger vehicles, as well as the impact of the permission on street user safety, traffic, and the environment. The Commissioner would have to identify intersections where right turn at a red signal is already permitted and where motorists could be permitted to make a right turn at a red signal. The Commissioner would be required to submit a 6-month update on the study to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council, and then 6 months later submit to these officials, and post online, a report on final study findings.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. a. Definitions. For purposes of this local law, the following terms have the following meanings:\n      Commissioner. The term \"commissioner\" means the commissioner of transportation.\n      Corner sight distance. The term \"corner sight distance\" means a motorist's unobstructed vision of an intersection and of sufficient lengths of the intersecting roadways to allow the motorist to anticipate and avoid other motor vehicles.\n      Department. The term \"department\" means the department of transportation.\n      High-priority intersection. The term \"high-priority intersection\" means an intersection designated by the commissioner based on a consideration of factors, including but not limited to the number of serious vehicular crashes occurring at the intersection each year.\n      Older adult center. The term \"older adult center\" means a facility, other than a social adult day care as defined in section 215 of the elder law, operated by a person pursuant to a contract with the department for the aging to provide services, including but not limited to meals, recreation, and counseling, to individuals 60 years of age or older on a regular basis.\n      Person. The term \"person\" has the same meaning as set forth in section 1-112 of the administrative code of the city of New York.\n      Serious vehicular crash. The term \"serious vehicular crash\" means any collision between a motor vehicle and a pedestrian, cyclist, motorist, or any other individual that results in significant injury to or the death of any individual.\n      Significant injury. The term \"significant injury\" means any injury categorized as an \"A\" injury by the New York state department of motor vehicles, any injury that requires hospitalization, or any other injury as determined by the commissioner.\n      Traffic control signal. The term \"traffic control signal\" has the same meaning as set forth in section 154 of the vehicle and traffic law. \n      b. Right turn on red signal on Staten Island study.  The commissioner, in consultation with community boards of community districts in Staten Island, the department of environmental protection, and the New York city police department, shall study the feasibility of permitting motorists to make a right turn at a red signal following a complete stop at each intersection with a traffic control signal on Staten Island. Through the study, the commissioner shall: \n      1. Consider the impact that the permission will have on vehicular collision rates;\n      2. Identify geometric conditions in which ample corner sight distance is not available; \n      3. Evaluate geometric constraints involving trucks and other large motor vehicles encroaching on several lanes of traffic while making turns;\n      4. Consider the impact that the permission will have on pedestrian, cyclist, motorist, and other street user safety, including but not limited to at intersections with a traffic control signal near schools, at intersections with a traffic control signal near older adult centers, and at high-priority intersections;\n      5. Consider the impact that the permission will have on traffic congestion, based on, at a minimum, data on motor vehicle delay and queues at intersections with a traffic control signal;\n      6. Consider the impact that the permission will have on the environment based on, at a minimum, data on motor vehicle delay, queues, and idling at intersections with a traffic control signal;\n      7. Assess the likelihood of motorists' failure to make a complete stop before making a right turn at a red signal; \n      8. Identify intersections with a traffic control signal, grouped by community district, at which motorists are already permitted to make a right turn at a red signal;\n      9. Based at a minimum on the factors set forth in paragraphs 1 through 7 of this subdivision, identify intersections with a traffic control signal, grouped by community district, where motorists could be permitted to make a right turn at a red signal following a complete stop; and\n      10. Identify potential means and methods of outreach and education for motorists concerning the permission and related traffic enforcement efforts.\n      c. Interim study update. No later than 6 months after the effective date of this local law, the commissioner shall submit to the mayor and the speaker of the council a written update regarding any preliminary findings of the study conducted pursuant to subdivision b of this section.\n      d. Report. 1. No later than 1 year after the effective date of this local law, the commissioner shall submit to the mayor and the speaker of the council and post on the department's website a report on the findings of the study conducted pursuant to subdivision b of this section. \n      2. If the commissioner determines through the study that permitting motorists to make a right turn at a red signal following a complete stop at any intersection with a traffic control signal on Staten Island would be feasible, the commissioner shall include specific recommendations in the report for implementation of the permission, including but not limited to recommendations for sign placement, motorist outreach and education measures, and appropriate enforcement mechanisms. \n      3. If the commissioner determines through the study that permitting motorists to make a right turn at a red signal following a complete stop at any intersection with a traffic control signal on Staten Island would be infeasible, the commissioner shall include in the report a statement of the reasons for the determination and a map identifying any such intersection.\n      � 2. This local law takes effect immediately.\n\n\nDPM\nLS #20175\n11/6/2025 2:43 PM\n      2\n      \n      \n      1",
