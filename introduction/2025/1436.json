  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Veterans Services (DVS) to establish and administer a fund from which grants may be awarded to veterans service organizations and other relevant community-based organizations to support veteran treatment court mentors in New York City. Grant funds may be used by the recipient organizations for things like outreach to potential mentors, training for mentors, and the reimbursement of reasonable, documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by mentors in connection with their volunteer service. The bill would also require that the department submit an annual report describing the grants awarded.",
