  "Summary": "This bill would require the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene to create a construction site opioid antagonist program to address opioid overdoses at construction sites. The program would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to provide five opioid antagonist kits to every major building construction site, free of charge, for administration to individuals experiencing an opioid overdose. The Commissioner would be required to provide training on the administration of opioid antagonists to site safety professionals, and to offer such training to construction workers. The Commissioner would also be required to report annually to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council on the number of construction sites, the number of opioid antagonist kits provided by DOHMH to construction sites, the number of kits used by each construction site, the number of site safety professionals, the number of opioid antagonist trainings provided to site safety professionals, the number of construction workers, and the number of opioid antagonist trainings provided to construction workers.",
