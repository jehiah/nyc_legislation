  "Summary": "This bill would require the commissioner of finance to submit to the council and post online an annual report on properties encumbered by chronically unresolved tax liens—defined as tax liens that remain unsatisfied for 36 months or more after being sold. In connection with the required annual report, this bill would require the commissioner of finance to provide annually a list of such properties to heads of agencies charged with property-related enforcement. In turn, this bill would require such agency heads to report to the mayor on inspections undertaken of such properties and the outcome of those inspections.",
