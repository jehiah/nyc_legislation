  "Summary": "This bill would require businesses that provide shopping carts to their customers to permanently affix a tag to their shopping carts that identifies the owner’s name, store address and phone number or e-mail. It would also require these businesses to implement a shopping cart containment measure approved by the Commissioner of Consumer and Worker and Protection. Failure to add the required tag or adopt a shopping cart containment measure would subject the business to a $100 civil penalty per cart. The Department of Sanitation would be required to contact shopping cart owners to retrieve shopping carts it has removed from the streets and impose a civil penalty of $100 for each shopping cart that is not retrieved within 48 hours of notice.",
