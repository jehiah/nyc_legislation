  "Summary": "This bill would create the Existing Building Code (“EBC”), modeled on the 2021 International Existing Building Code, which would improve and simplify requirements for the alteration and maintenance of the City’s existing building stock. Additionally, this bill would create a work area requirement to measure an alteration’s size and applicable code requirements. This bill would also create a Limited Home Improvement Permit for 1- and 2-family 17 dwellings, to be filed by a homeowner or a licensed home improvement contractor, to provide a path for homeowners to obtain work permits for specific types of home improvement alterations. Additionally, this bill would create a standardized method to verify the stability of buildings being altered and require a more thorough assessment when the proposed alterations increase the level of structural demand in the building. Finally, this bill would repeal the 1968 Building Code, as codified in Chapter 1 of Title 27 of the Administrative Code.",
