This Appendix gives requirements for connecting walls to floors and parapets and chimneys to roofs for existing unreinforced masonry buildings with wood framed floors or roofs, where required by Chapter 7.\nThe provisions of this Appendix are intended as minimum standards for incrementally improving structural seismic resistance and are established primarily to reduce the risk of loss, damage to property or injury to persons. Compliance with these provisions will not necessarily prevent loss of life or injury or prevent earthquake damage to retrofitted buildings. \nThis Appendix is based on a seismic design criteria limit of Sd1<=.133, and wind conditions of Exposure D. This Appendix does not apply to essential or hazardous facilities.\nA101.2 Definitions.\nUNREINFORCED MASONRY (URM). Includes burned clay, concrete, or sand-lime brick; hollow clay or concrete block; plain concrete; and hollow clay tile.\nUNREINFORCED MASONRY WALL. A masonry wall that:\n1. Relies solely on the tensile strength of masonry units, mortar, and grout in resisting design loads. Any area of reinforcement that may be present is neglected in determining resistance to loads; and\n2. Carries a minimum service load of 100 pounds per lineal foot (1459 N/m) of roof and/or floor loads.\n\nSECTION EBC A102\nMASONRY WALL CONNECTIONS\nA102.1 Connection locations. Unreinforced masonry walls shall be connected at the roof and floor levels.\nA102.1.1 Connection requirements. Connections shall consist of existing connections and/or new connections. New connections shall be as shown in Figures A1-1, A1-2 or A1-3 where applicable, and provided at a maximum plan spacing of five feet and four inches (1625 mm) on center. A registered design professional can provide alternative anchor spacings and details for loads conforming to the New York City Building Code. All wall connections shall be secured to the framing members parallel or perpendicular to the wall. Cross-grain bending in wood members used for wall connections is prohibited.\nA102.2 Minimum wall connection capacity. Connection of walls to each floor or roof shall be able to resist a minimum service load of 200 pounds per linear foot (2919 N/m), acting normal to the wall at the level of the floor or roof. Existing wall connections, if used, must meet the requirements of this chapter, or must be supplemented with new connections to comply with requirements.\nA102.2.1 Existing wall connections capacity. Existing connections used as all or part of the required wall connections shall be considered to have a service tension capacity of 100 pounds (445 N), unless tested or evaluated by a registered design professional. Friction shall be neglected in determining existing connection capacity.\nA102.2.2 Wall connections per New York City Building Code Chapter 33. Wall connections installed as required by Section 3309 and attached to joists in a manner similar to Detail A1-1 may be deemed to comply with the requirements of this Appendix.\nA102.3 Wall connection testing and inspection. New wall connections shall be tested and inspected in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 17 of the New York City Building Code, and as required by the connection manufacturer. Testing of existing wall connections, if required, shall be specified and evaluated by a registered design professional.\nA102.4\t Existing wall wythe bonding and pattern. A registered design professional shall confirm that the existing exterior wall wythes that are being anchored are properly bonded together. If wythes are not properly bonded together, or the bonding pattern of wythes is different from header courses every sixth course, a registered design professional shall evaluate the conditions and design repairs if required.\n\nSECTION EBC A103\nPARAPETS AND CHIMNEYS\nA103.1 Parapet and Chimney heights. The maximum height of an unbraced unreinforced masonry parapet or chimney above the lower of either the level of anchors or the roof sheathing shall not exceed 3.0 times its thickness. Other ratios may be used if justified by a registered design professional. Parapets and chimneys not conforming to this chapter shall be removed, reduced in height if allowed, stabilized, strengthened, or laterally braced to ensure that the parapets and chimneys remain in their original positions and conform to this chapter.\nA103.2 Lateral bracing. If the parapet or chimney height exceeds the allowed maximum, and new lateral bracing is chosen as a remedy, then the lateral bracing system shall be as shown in Figures A1.4 through A1.6 as applicable. A registered design professional can provide alternative bracing details for loads conforming to the New York City Building Code. Parapet and chimney corrective work is to be performed in conjunction with the installation of roof connections.\nA103.3 Existing coping connections. The stability and strength of connections of parapet and chimney copings shall be evaluated by a registered design professional.\n\n\n   \n  \n\nCHAPTER A2\nRESERVED\n\nCHAPTER A3\nPRESCRIPTIVE AND SCHEMATIC PROVISIONS FOR STRENGTHENING \nOF SILL PLATE ANCHORAGE AND CRIPPLE WALLS OF LIGHT, WOOD-FRAME RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS \nSECTION A301\nGENERAL\nA301.1 Purpose. The provisions of this chapter are intended to reduce the risk of lateral force induced damage to existing wood-frame residential buildings. The requirements in this chapter are prescriptive or schematic minimum standards intended to incrementally improve the lateral force resisting performance of residential buildings. Compliance with these provisions will not necessarily prevent damage due to earthquake, wind, or flood loading.\nThis chapter includes standards for strengthening that may be approved by the commissioner without requiring submittal of plans or calculations prepared by a registered design professional. The provisions of this chapter are not intended to prevent the use of any material or method of construction not prescribed herein. The commissioner may require that construction documents for strengthening using alternative materials or methods be prepared by a registered design professional.\nA301.2 Scope. Perform prescriptive strengthening and/or repairs of sill connections per Figures A3-1 through A3-3. For framing conditions or materials not shown in these Figures, consult a registered design professional. For strengthening and/or repairing cripple walls, use the recommended schematic information in Figures A3-4 through A3-6 in conjunction with consultation with a registered design professional. If existing sill plates are in poor condition, consult a registered design professional.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER A4\nSTRENGTHENING PROVISIONS FOR UNREINFORCED MASONRY WALL BUILDINGS WITH OPEN FRONT OR REAR WALLS AT GROUND FLOOR LEVEL\nSECTION EBC A401\nSCOPE\nA401.1. Applicability. The prescriptive provisions of this chapter may be applied without performing numerical calculations. The provisions of this Appendix are limited to the following conditions:\n1. Buildings of four stories or less.\n2. The existing or proposed soft story occurs at only the lowest building level.\n3. The building is less than 40.5 feet (12,344 mm) tall from the ground level to the top of the parapet.\n4. The building has a rectangular or approximately rectangular plan width by length footprint that varies within 20 feet by 60 feet (6,096 mm x 18,288 mm) to 25 feet by 85 feet (7,620 mm x 25,908 mm). \n5. The soft story occurs on the shorter side of the rectangle.\n6. The wall containing the soft story is solid masonry 12\" (304.8 mm) thick. \n7. The typical floor of the building is wood framed construction. \n\nA401.2. General. Provide prescriptive strengthening of the soft story per Section A402, or alternatively strengthen the soft story with the aid of a registered design professional following methods described in Chapter 7 of the New York City Existing Building Code.\n\nSECTION EBC A402\nPRESCRIPTIVE REQUIREMENTS\nA402.1. General. A new steel moment frame shall be added at the soft story. The moment frame shall be located in the plane of the wall opening. The minimum permitted member sizes and connection details for the prescriptive steel posts and beams for the moment frame are shown in Figures A4-1 through A4-7.\nA402.2.
