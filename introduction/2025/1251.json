  "Summary": "Pursuant to Local Law 18 of 2021, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene must make 445 supervisory license applications available to prospective mobile food vendors every year within a ten year period from 2022 through 2032. However, not every license application results in a license issued, which means that there may be less than 445 supervisory licenses issued in a given year.\r\nThis bill would authorize the department to issue more than 445 license applications each year, so that up to 445 supervisory licenses are issued every twelve months, and up to 4,445 supervisory licenses are issued by July 1, 2032.",
