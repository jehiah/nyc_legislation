  "Summary": "Pursuant to Introduction 431-B, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) would make 2,200 supervisory license applications available to prospective mobile food vendors every year within a five-year period from 2026 through 2031, and the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) would make 10,500 general vending license applications available to prospective general vendors in 2027. However, not every license application released would result in a license issued, which means that there could be less licenses issued than are authorized.\r\nThis bill would authorize DOHMH and DCWP to continue to issue more license applications until the licenses issued reaches the capped amount, provided there is a demand for it.",
