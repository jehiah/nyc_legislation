  "Summary": "This bill would allow city agencies to request voluntary disclosures from bidders on city contracts about their efforts to identify and address labor and human rights risks in their operations and supply chains. The disclosures would cover risks such as child labor, forced labor, wage theft, unsafe working conditions and violations of freedom of association. The disclosures would not apply to contracts below the small purchase limit, emergency procurements, professional services contracts, and contracts subject to federal or state requirements that would preclude such disclosures.\r\n\r\nContracting agencies could not require such disclosures as part of their vendor responsibility determinations, bidders could not be deemed non-responsible solely for declining to provide a disclosure and the information provided could not be the sole basis for contract award decisions. The Mayor's Office of Contract Services would develop a standardized disclosure form for agencies to use when requesting these voluntary disclosures.",
