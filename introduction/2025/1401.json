  "Summary": "This bill would allow city agencies to request voluntary disclosures from bidders on city contracts about their efforts to identify and address labor and human rights risks in their operations and supply chains. The disclosures would cover risks such as child labor, forced labor, wage theft, unsafe working conditions, and violations of freedom of association. Bidders could not be deemed non-responsible solely for declining to provide a disclosure, and the information provided could not be the sole basis for contract award decisions. The Mayor's Office of Contract Services would maintain these disclosures in a centralized database and submit annual reports to the Council on the program's implementation.",
