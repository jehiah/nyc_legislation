  "Summary": "This bill would clarify the findings that the Board of Standard and Appeals must make to grant modifications to the use, bulk, and parking regulation in the city’s zoning resolution for projects seeking to build affordable housing.  Currently, under the first finding of the fast-track action for affordable housing projects, BSA only has to analyze the ownership structure of the proposed development and does not have to evaluate the number of affordable units proposed or their level of affordability.  The bill would clarify that at least 50 percent of the dwelling units in the proposed affordable housing project must be income-restricted units and that the income restriction cannot exceed 120 percent of the area median income.  The bill would further require that BSA specify in its decision the number of affordable units that the proposed residential project will have, the income restrictions for the affordable units, and when the affordable units are projected to be occupied.",
