  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Education (DOE) to report annually on manifestation determination reviews conducted for students with disabilities. The DOE would be required to report the number of students referred for a manifestation determination review and the number of reviews conducted each school year. The DOE would also be required to report data related to parent notification and attendance at reviews, requests for translation services, and information on the timing of key steps in the review process. The DOE would also be required to report on various other metrics relating to the manifestation determination reviews including the results of those reviews, and how many students had more than one review in the same school year. The report would also include a summary of system-wide practices used to inform parents and guardians about the manifestation determination review process.",
