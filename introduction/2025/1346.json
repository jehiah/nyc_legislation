  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation (DOT) to study the licensed and unlicensed vans that make up New York City’s commuter van industry. DOT would be required to study the service areas and ridership of commuter vans, survey commuter van passengers about their use of commuter vans and other forms of transportation, including public transit, and report on areas where commuter vans interfere with buses, pedestrians, and delivery zones. DOT would be required to complete this study by July 1, 2027 and every four years thereafter. The DOT commissioner may discontinue the study after October 1, 2039, if the commissioner determines that future studies are no longer necessary.",
