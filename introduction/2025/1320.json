In addition, this bill would subject owners of real property to a maximum civil penalty of $250 upon being issued notice of a sidewalk defect that poses an immediate danger to the public if such owners knew or should have known of the defect unless the Department of Transportation determines that the failure to address such defect before notification is reasonable under the circumstances.",
