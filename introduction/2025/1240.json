  "Summary": "This bill would require the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice (MOCJ) to establish a holistic needs assessment program. Pursuant to the program, MOCJ will, upon consent, compete an asssement to identify mental health, physical health, substance abuse, intellectual disabilities, domestic violence and abuse history, history of trauma, emotional dysregulation, and other psychosocial conditions or circumstances at the time of a person’s arrest. This assessment will be provided to a person’s criminal defense attorney within 14 days of supreme court arraignment so that it may be used to inform charging, detention, release, or plea agreement decisions.",
