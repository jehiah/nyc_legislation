  "Summary": "This bill would require the commissioner of the Department of Records and Information Services (DoRIS) to create a centralized Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) request website to receive, track, update, and posts responses to agency FOIL requests. It would also require the commissioner to formulate performance guidelines for agencies based on FOIL response statistics for each agency, and to convene semi-annual meetings of agency FOIL officers regarding the implementation of, and updates for, this centralized FOIL website.",
