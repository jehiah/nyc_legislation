These provisions shall be known and cited as the \"New York City Energy Conservation Code,\" \"NYCECC\" or \"ECC,\" and are referred to herein as \"this code.\" All section numbers in this code shall be deemed to be preceded by the designation \"ECC.\" Administration and enforcement of this code shall be in accordance with Title 28 of the Administrative Code.\n101.1.1 Titles. \nThe publication entitled 2025 Energy Conservation Construction Code of New York State shall be known as the \"ECCCNYS.\"\nThe New York State-specific version of the publication entitled \"Standard 90.1, Energy Standard for Buildings Except Low-Rise Residential Buildings,\" published by the International Code Council, as incorporated in the ECCCNYS shall be known as \"2025 NYS ASHRAE 90.1.\" All references in this code to \"2025 NYC ASHRAE 90.1\" reflect New York City amendments to 2025 NYS ASHRAE 90.1 as amended by Section 28-1001.2.2 of the Administrative Code. \nThe ECCCNYS, as contained in Part 1240 of Title 19 of the New York Codes, Rules and Regulations, along with the New York City amendments to such ECCCNYS shall be known collectively as the \"New York City Energy Conservation Code\" or \"NYCECC.\"\n101.1.2 References. Where reference is made within this code to the Building Code of New York State, Existing Building Code of New York State, Fire Code of New York State, Fuel Gas Code of New York State, Mechanical Code of New York State, Plumbing Code of New York State, Property Maintenance Code of New York State, or Residential Code of New York State, the reference shall be deemed to be to the analogous provision of the New York City Construction Codes (Title 28 of the Administrative Code), the 1968 Building Code (Chapter 1 of Title 27 of the Administrative Code), the New York City Fire Code (Title 29 of the Administrative Code) or the New York City Electrical Code (Chapter 11 of Title 28 of the Administrative Code). \n101.2 Scope. This code regulates the design and construction of commercial buildings and residential buildings, as defined in Chapter C2 and Chapter R2 of this code, accessory structures, building sites, and associated systems and equipment, as well as the repair, addition, alteration, or change of occupancy thereto for the use and conservation of energy and clean energy features, including the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, over the life of each such commercial and residential building.\n101.2.1 Statutory limitations. In the event of an addition to, or alteration of, an existing building or building system in an existing building that does not include a change of occupancy, nothing in the this code shall be interpreted to require any unaltered portion of such existing building or building system to comply with this code.\n101.2.2 Occupancy classifications. For determination of occupancy classification and use within this code, a comparable occupancy classification shall be made to the New York City Building Code.\n101.2.3 Reconciliation with New York State Energy Conservation Construction Code. Whenever any provision of the New York State Energy Conservation Construction Code provides for a more stringent requirement than imposed by this code, the more stringent requirement shall govern. The department may interpret provisions of this code that are (1) in addition to the provisions of the New York State Energy Conservation Construction Code or (2) more stringent than the provisions of such Code.\n101.2.4 Other laws. The provisions of this code shall not be deemed to nullify any federal, state or local law, rule or regulation relating to any matter as to which this code does not provide, including but not limited to�Articles 320 and 321 of�Chapter 3 of Title 28 of the Administrative Code. Where the energy efficiency, energy use, or water use of covered products or equipment is subject to federal preemption pursuant to the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, the requirements set forth by the Department of Energy in the Code of Federal Regulations take precedence over any requirement in this Code.\n101.2.5 Exceptions. This code shall not apply to the alterations of existing buildings set forth in items 1 through 7, provided that the alteration will not increase the energy usage of the building:\n1. Storm windows installed over existing fenestration.\n2. Glass-only replacements in an existing sash and frame, provided that the U-factor and the solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) shall be equal to or lower than before the glass replacement.\n3.\tSurface-applied window film installed on existing single-pane fenestration assemblies reducing solar heat gain, provided that this code does not require the glazing or fenestration to be replaced.\n4. Reroofing where neither the sheathing nor the insulation is exposed. Roofs without insulation in the cavity and where the sheathing or insulation is exposed during reroofing shall be insulated either above or below the sheathing.\n5. Replacement of existing doors that separate conditioned space from the exterior shall not require the installation of a vestibule or revolving door, provided that an existing vestibule that separates a conditioned space from the exterior shall not be removed.\n6. An alteration that replaces less than 10 percent of the luminaires in a space, provided that such alteration does not increase the installed interior lighting power.\n7. An alteration that replaces only the bulb and ballast within the existing luminaires in a space, provided that such alteration does not increase the installed interior lighting power.\n101.3 Intent. This code shall regulate the design and construction of buildings for the use and conservation of energy over the life of each building. This code is intended to provide flexibility to permit the use of innovative approaches and techniques to achieve this objective.
