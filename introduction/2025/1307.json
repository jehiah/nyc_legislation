  "Summary": "This bill would create a film, television, and theater accessibility fund administered by the Mayor’s Office of Media and Entertainment (MOME), in collaboration with the Mayor’s Office for People with Disabilities and the Mayor’s Office of Talent and Workforce Development. Through this fund, MOME would award grants to film, television, and theater productions that commit to hiring and accommodating persons with disabilities, including through the engagement of production access coordinators. MOME would also provide resources and guidance to productions, collect and analyze data on disability employment in the industry, and share best practices. In addition, the bill requires MOME to post information about the fund on its website, and submit an annual report detailing how grant money was used, the number of persons with disabilities hired by each production, and other information relevant to evaluating the fund’s effectiveness.",
