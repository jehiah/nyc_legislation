  "Summary": "This bill would require city agencies to submit annual reports on contract registration during the previous fiscal year. An agency would be required to submit a corrective action plan by January 1 if it: (1) registered 100 or more contracts or contracts valued at over $10 million in the previous fiscal year; and (2) more than 30 percent of its contracts or contract value were registered 90 days or more after their start dates. Such corrective action plans would need to analyze the causes of delays, specify improvements to be made, include implementation timelines, and set performance targets. The city chief procurement officer would be required to submit an annual report to the Mayor and Council analyzing citywide trends in the effectiveness of these corrective action plans.",
