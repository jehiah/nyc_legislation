  "Summary": "This bill would amend the definition of “plumbing work” in the Construction Code to include “geothermal piping,” such that anyone installing, maintaining, or repairing any plumbing components of geothermal energy systems would be required to hold a master plumber license. The bill would also define “geothermal piping” and “geothermal system” in the Construction Code. Finally, the bill would require the Commissioner of Buildings to submit to the Mayor and the Speaker, and publish on the Department of Buildings website, a report that includes recommendations to amend the Construction Codes to ensure professional safety and standardization in geothermal system installation.",
