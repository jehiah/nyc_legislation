  "Summary": "This bill would require the Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability, in consultation with the Department of Environmental Protection, and the Department of Buildings (DOB) to conduct a study to develop construction code amendments to address stormwater flood risks. This bill would also require DOB to indicate on its building information system online portal whether a property is within the 10-year rainfall flood risk area, and a link to information about the risks of stormwater flooding to properties. Finally, this bill would amend Appendix G of the Building Code to require that above-ground tanks in the 10-year rainfall flood risk area be elevated to account for the risks of stormwater flooding.",
