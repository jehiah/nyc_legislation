  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Environmental Protection, in consultation with the Department of Buildings and the Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability, to indicate a base flood elevation level within the 10-year rainfall flood risk areas on the updated flood risk area map. This bill would also amend Appendix G of the Building Code to require that new or substantially altered buildings in 10-year rainfall flood risk areas be built to the standards that apply to some federal special flood hazard areas.",
