  "Summary": "This bill would require the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs (MOIA) to conduct an assessment of the available resources and any service gaps in the City for newly arrived migrants who are transgender, gender non-conforming, non-binary, and intersex. The assessment would review the particular needs of these communities and what resources exist for them, and then develop an implementation plan to address service gaps based on the findings. The bill would require MOIA to submit the assessment to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council no later than 18 months after the effective date of the local law.",
