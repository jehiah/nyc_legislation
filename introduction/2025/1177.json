  "Summary": "The Health Code currently requires certain chain restaurants to post sodium warnings when they sell food containing high sodium. This bill would codify that rule in the Administrative Code and expand it to include all restaurants, regardless of the number of locations. Additionally, this bill would expand the requirement to post added sugar notifications to all restaurants.",
