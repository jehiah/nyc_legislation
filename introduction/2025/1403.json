  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation to conduct a study on the feasibility and potential benefits of a zone-based transit fare system. In this bill, a zone-based system means a system of charging fares based on the residency of the rider. The bill would also require the Department of Transportation to report on the feasibility of a pilot program of a tap-in, tap-out transit payment system, in which riders would be required to tap a card to both enter and exit a station.",

Zone-based fares study. The commissioner, in consultation with the metropolitan transportation authority, shall conduct a study on the feasibility and possible effects of implementing a zone-based system for collecting fares on public transit. Through this study, the commissioner shall:\n      1. Identify the number of riders who would be charged each of the 4 separate zone-based fares;\n      2. Identify any logistical challenges and potential barriers to implementing this system;\n      3.
