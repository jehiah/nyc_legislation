  "Summary": "This bill would require the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to create an education campaign for healthcare providers about opioid use disorder (OUD) and how to safely treat it during and after pregnancy. The campaign must be developed with medical professional organizations, and focus on the benefits of using approved medications (like methadone or buprenorphine) to treat OUD during pregnancy, known as opioid agonist therapy; the dangers of withdrawal for both the pregnant person and the baby; and recommendations from trusted medical organizations and the New York State Department of Health. Additionally, the bill requires the city to offer opioid antagonists (medications like naloxone) for free at neighborhood health service centers. These centers must also provide information about how to use these medications safely and the risks of opioid use during and after pregnancy.",
