  "Summary": "Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or “PFAS,” are chemicals associated with increased risks of adverse health effects. This bill would require the fire department, in conjunction with the department of environmental protection, to test drinking water from all fixtures used for drinking water in firehouses to determine the levels of PFAS chemicals present. If elevated levels of PFAS chemicals are detected, the fire department would be responsible for remediation. The commissioner of the fire department would also be required to report the results of the PFAS testing and remediation.",
