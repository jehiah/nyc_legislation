  "Summary": "This bill would amend New York City’s cooling tower testing requirements by requiring building owners to test cooling towers for the presence of microbes at least as frequently as every month during periods of the year such cooling towers are in use. The bill further requires that all such testing be performed by or under the supervision of a qualified person. The bill would also require building owners to perform a biocide treatment of each cooling tower during warm weather when there is an increased risk of legionella growth, as determined by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH). Finally, the bill renews reporting requirements for DOHMH on cooling tower registrations, certifications, inspections, testing, and reported diagnoses of Legionnaires’ disease.",
