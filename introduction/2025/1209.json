  "Summary": "This bill would require the office of emergency management to assess the risks to the city from wildfires and to devise strategies to proactively mitigate those risks and to reduce potential losses to human life and property resulting from wildfires. The bill would require the office to report every five years on the results of that assessment. This reporting requirement could be satisfied by including wildfires in the city’s hazard mitigation plan.",
