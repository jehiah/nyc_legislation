  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Environmental Protection (“DEP”) to determine areas at risk of groundwater flooding in New York City and add such areas to the flood hazard area map. The bill would also require DEP to consider the need to update the groundwater flood risk area when new data related to groundwater levels in New York City are available. The bill would also amend Appendix U of the Building Code to prohibit cellar or basement accessory dwelling units in groundwater flood risk areas 90 days after DEP updates such map.",

Subdivision a of section 24-809 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a definition of \"groundwater flood risk area\" in alphabetical order to read as follows:\n      Groundwater flood risk area. The term \"groundwater flood risk area\" means an area designated on a map promulgated by the department that represents locations in the city where the depth to the water table is less than 10 feet, incorporating the impacts of the projected 2050 sea level rise on groundwater table depths as projected by the United States geological survey. \n      � 2.

The department shall adopt any such updated coastal flood risk area by rule and post such updated map with the flood risk area map adopted in accordance with this paragraph.\n\t(c) Within 1 year of the issuance of new projections by the New York city panel on climate change, pursuant to subdivision 2 of section 3-122, the department may, in consultation with the department of buildings, the office of long-term planning and sustainability, and other relevant agencies, consider whether the 10-year rainfall risk area adopted pursuant to subparagraph (a) of this paragraph should be updated based on such projections, and any other data such agencies determine to be reasonable.
