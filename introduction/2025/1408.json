  "Summary": "This bill would require the Commissioner of the Department of Social Services (DSS), in collaboration with the Commissioner of the Department of Parks and Recreation (Parks) and any other relevant New York City agency head, to conduct a study to analyze Hart Island’s capacity for future public burials under existing burial procedures. In conducting the study, the DSS commissioner would be required to solicit input and feedback from family members of those buried at Hart Island. As part of the study, the agency heads would be required to assess whether the procedures should be changed and develop recommendations to implement any changes determined to be appropriate. Finally, DSS would have to submit to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council a report containing the study findings and recommendations. The agency heads would have to post such report to their respective websites.",

If, pursuant to paragraph 3 of this subdivision, the commissioner of social services determines that changes in such procedures would increase burial capacity on Hart Island, develop recommendations for such changes and provide justification for how such recommendations would increase burial capacity.\n      c.
