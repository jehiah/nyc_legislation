  "Summary": "This bill would require the commissioner of the Department of Social Services (DSS), in collaboration with the commissioner of the Department of Parks and Recreation (Parks) and any other relevant New York City agency head, to conduct a study to analyze Hart Island’s capacity for future public burials under existing burial procedures. The agency heads would have to assess whether the procedures should be changed and develop recommendations if any changes are determined appropriate. Finally, the agency heads would have to submit to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council and post online a report containing the study findings and recommendations.",
