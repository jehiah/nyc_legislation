  "Summary": "This bill would require the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene to develop a “Doula Bill of Rights” that includes State laws that affect a doula and their work with birthing people in hospitals. The bill would also require the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene to develop a submission form to receive feedback from doulas working with birthing parents in hospitals in New York City and to share a summary of the feedback annually. Finally, the bill would establish a doula advisory council to study the work of doulas in the city and advise the Citywide Doula Program, comprised of doulas, recent parents, the Commissioner, and would invite a representative of NYC Health + Hospitals.",
