  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DOITT) to conduct a gendered impact assessment every two years for certain algorithmic tools used by city agencies. In consultation with labor organizations, gender equity experts, and affected communities, DOITT must evaluate whether the use of gender in these tools may lead to disparate impacts. The report shall include a list of tools using gender data, assessment dates, and mitigation recommendations. \r\nThis bill would also establish an interagency task force on the gender equity of artificial intelligence tools in the workforce. The task force must meet at least twice a year to examine how such tools are impacting employment outcomes for agency employees based on gender, including job displacement and changes in job roles.",
