No such concession or restaurant shall extend beyond the boundaries indicated on such map. The department shall visibly mark the authorized boundaries of each such concession or restaurant and shall maintain such markings, unless all boundaries of such concession or restaurant are within a building or similar stationary structure or marking a boundary is not practicable because the terrain does not allow for such marking.

This subdivision shall not apply to any concession authorized to occupy a ground space of less than two hundred square feet, to occupy an area greater than two acres, or to operate in locations in three or more boroughs, nor shall this subdivision apply to any concession that is expressly authorized to move its location pursuant to the terms of the applicable concession agreement.
