  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Small Business Services (SBS) to establish a youth entrepreneurship and business development program for individuals between the ages of 18 and 30. The program would provide participants with entrepreneurship training and work experience that prepares them to compete for city contracts, as well as comprehensive business fundamentals education. SBS would be required to conduct targeted outreach in communities experiencing barriers to entrepreneurship and economic opportunity, including communities identified in the city's M/WBE disparity studies as underrepresented in city contracting.",
