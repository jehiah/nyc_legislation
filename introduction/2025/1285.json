  "Summary": "This bill would require the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene to establish a program to provide free doula services to people in marginalized neighborhoods in all five boroughs, to train individuals to become doulas, and to offer assistance to certain maternity hospitals to foster a doula friendly environment. The program would train doulas in birth equity, trauma-informed care, perinatal mood and anxiety disorders, navigating the hospital environment and support services available to low-income birthing people and their families. The bill would also require the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene to submit a report to the Mayor and Speaker of the Council on the services provided by the program and an analysis on the use and outcomes of the program.",
