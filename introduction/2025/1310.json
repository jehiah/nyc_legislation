  "Summary": "This bill would require the mayor and comptroller to keep certain information on the identity of subcontractors who perform work on city contracts. This information would be compiled in the computerized database they are currently required to maintain. The bill would also increase penalties for providing false information related to the qualifications of any bidder on city contracts and create penalties for providing false information related to a subcontract submitted for approval. Finally, the law would provide a section heading for section 6-116.2 of the administrative code.",
