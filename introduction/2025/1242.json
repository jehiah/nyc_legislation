  "Summary": "This bill would require the establishment of an Office of Coordinator for Rikers Island Closure with a full-time coordinator and dedicated staff that reports directly to the Mayor. This new office will be responsible for coordinating actions and policies by agencies with a role in the closure of Rikers Island, including those with duties related to jail population reduction, design and construction of the borough-based jails, design and construction of outposted therapeutic housing units, correctional workforce development, training, and operations, and planning for the future use of Rikers Island for environmental sustainability and resiliency purposes.  In addition, this bill also requires the establishment of Coordinator for Borough-Based Jail Transition within the department of correction. Among other things, that position will be responsible for advising and assisting the commissioner and developing a strategic plan with recommended reforms to staff recruitment, training, supervision, assignments, scheduling, operations, and organizational culture that can be implemented in order to improve conditions for current jail staff and people in custody and facilitate a successful transition and improve safety for jail staff and people in custody at the borough-based jails and outposted therapeutic housing units.",
