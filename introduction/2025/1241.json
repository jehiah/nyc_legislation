  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Correction to conduct a study to determine any inefficiencies in the early release program established in accordance with Article 6A of the New York State Correction Law that permits sentenced individuals to be released from jail and serve the remainder of their sentence at home, under supervision. As part of the study, the Department of Correction would be required to develop recommendations for how to address those inefficiencies and expand the program to its fullest potential. It would also require the Department of Correction to produce a quarterly report on use of the early release (6A) program including the number of individuals who were considered for the program, accepted into the program and released, and rejected for the program.",
