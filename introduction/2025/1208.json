  "Summary": "This bill would require the Commissioner of Social Services and the Commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development, to issue a biannual report to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council on the availability of air conditioning in homeless shelters. The report would, in part, include information on which shelters have any air conditioning, the location of air conditioners, the type of air conditioning provided, repair needs, which shelters installed air conditioning during the past reporting period, and which shelters are planning to install air conditioning within the next reporting period. The report would have to be posted on the Department of Social Service’s website. The bill would also require that the respective Council Member be notified within 30 days of any outage of air conditioning for 72 hours or more at a shelter in their district. The bill would also require a one-time study assessing the needs required to install air conditioning in shelters that do not have air conditioning.",
