The report would, in part, include information on which shelters have any air conditioning, which have air conditioning in only some areas of the shelter, which have air conditioning throughout the shelter, the type of air conditioning provided, which shelters have air conditioning that needs repair, which shelters installed air conditioning during the past 12 months, and which shelters are planning to install air conditioning within the next 12 months. The report would have to be posted on the relevant agencies’ websites.",
