  "Summary": "This bill would prohibit delivery services from deactivating app-based contracted delivery workers unless the deactivation is for just cause or bona fide economic reasons. A delivery service would be required to use progressive discipline prior to deactivating a worker for just cause, unless such deactivation is for egregious misconduct, and would be required to provide notice of such deactivation within 72 hours of deactivating the worker. A delivery service would be required to provide 120 days’ advance notice prior to deactivation for bona fide economic reasons. An app-based contracted delivery worker may challenge their deactivation in an informal resolution process with the delivery service, or request that the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) investigate the deactivation. If DCWP determines the deactivation was wrongful, the delivery worker would be entitled to remedies including reinstatement and payment of lost earnings.",

Within 1 year after the effective date of the local law that added this section, a contracted delivery worker who was subject to a prior deactivation by a delivery service may petition such delivery service for reinstatement or restoration of access to such delivery service's delivery platform. Within 30 days after receipt of such petition, such delivery service shall reinstate or restore such contracted delivery worker's access to such delivery platform, unless such prior deactivation occurred during the probation period or was for just cause, for a bona fide economic reason, as described in section 20-1534, or required by federal, state, or local law or rule.\n      b. In determining whether a prior deactivation of a contracted delivery worker by a delivery service was for just cause, a fact-finder shall consider, in addition to any other relevant factors, whether:\n      1.

Such contracted delivery worker violated the policy, rule, or practice or committed the misconduct or failure to satisfactorily perform job duties that formed a basis for such prior deactivation; and\n      6. Such delivery service considered any exculpatory evidence or other facts indicating that such contracted delivery worker did not violate such delivery service's policy, rule or practice.\n      c. If a delivery service does not reinstate or restore access of a contracted delivery worker who was subject to a prior deactivation to such delivery service's delivery platform within 30 days after receipt of a petition pursuant to subdivision a of this section, such delivery service shall provide a written explanation, in a form and manner designated by the department, to such contracted delivery worker of all the precise and detailed reasons for such prior deactivation. Such written explanation shall include information about: (i) such contracted delivery worker's right to challenge such prior deactivation as unlawful pursuant to this subchapter; (ii) how such contracted delivery worker may initiate an informal resolution process with the delivery service pursuant to section 20-1537; (iii) the opportunity of such contracted delivery worker to submit evidence to substantiate a challenge to such prior deactivation; and (iv) such contracted delivery worker's right to file a complaint with the department, or initiate a private action.\n      d.

Where such delivery service declines to immediately reinstate or restore access to such delivery platform pursuant to this subdivision, such delivery service shall maintain a waitlist of contracted delivery worker whose access to such delivery platform is required to be reinstated or restored pursuant to subdivision a of this section and reinstate or restore such contracted delivery worker' access to such delivery platform, in the order in which such contracted delivery workers were placed on such waitlist, provided that any such contracted delivery worker meets the minimum requirements that apply to all current contracted delivery workers for such delivery service, prior to providing any other new contracted delivery worker access to such delivery platform.\n      � 20-1534 Bona fide economic reasons. a. A deactivation, including a prior deactivation, shall not be considered based on a bona fide economic reason unless supported by a delivery service's business records demonstrating that such deactivation is in response to: (i) a proportionate reduction in volume of sales or profit within the fiscal quarter that ended prior to the issuance of a notice of layoff required by subdivision d of section 20-1532; or (ii) a delivery service discontinuing its driving services in the city.\n      b. 1. Where a delivery service performs deactivations of contracted delivery workers based on a bona fide economic reason, such deactivations must be made in order of seniority of such contracted delivery workers, in accordance with rules of the department. For purposes of this section, seniority shall account for the date such contracted delivery worker commenced serving as a delivery worker for such service, and the amount of work performed by such contracted delivery worker in the timeframe. \n      2. A delivery service shall make reasonable efforts to offer reinstatement or restoration of access to such delivery service's delivery platform to any contracted delivery worker deactivated by such delivery service based on a bona fide economic reason within the previous 3 years, if any, before such delivery service may provide any other new contracted delivery worker access to such delivery platform.\n      3.

In determining whether a delivery service had just cause for a deactivation, a fact-finder may not consider any reasons proffered by the delivery service not included in the notice of deactivation provided to the contracted delivery worker pursuant to subdivision e of section 20-1532 or the written explanation provided to the contracted delivery worker pursuant to subdivision c of section 20-1533.\n      c. A contracted delivery worker may submit evidence in any proceeding alleging a violation of this subchapter that was not provided to a delivery service pursuant to section 20-1533 or section 20-1537, and a fact-finder shall consider such evidence, notwithstanding any failure by such contracted delivery worker to submit such evidence to such delivery service prior to such proceeding.\n      � 20-1536 Provision of data. a. Upon the issuance of a notice of deactivation required pursuant to subdivision e of section 20-1532, a delivery service shall provide a deactivated contracted delivery worker with information and data relevant to such contracted delivery worker's deactivation.

For at least 6 years after deactivating a contracted delivery worker, a delivery service must continue to provide such contracted delivery worker with access to all information and data concerning such contracted delivery worker that such contracted delivery worker had access to prior to deactivation, including but not limited to such contracted delivery worker's tax and payment records.\n      � 20-1537 Informal resolution process. a. A delivery service shall maintain an email address, website or other form of electronic communication through which a contracted delivery worker or their representative may challenge such contracted delivery worker's deactivation, prior deactivation, or impending deactivation for which such contracted delivery worker received a notice of layoff pursuant to subdivision d of section 20-1532 as unlawful pursuant to this subchapter. Such delivery service must provide such contracted delivery worker an opportunity to submit evidence to substantiate any such challenge and accept written communications pursuant to this section in the language in which they are written.\n      b. A contracted delivery worker may seek informal resolution of a deactivation of such contracted delivery worker, or an impending deactivation for which such contracted delivery worker receives a notice of layoff pursuant to subdivision d of section 20-1532, by a delivery service by initiating, within 1 year of such deactivation or receipt of such notice of layoff, an informal resolution process through the email address, website, or other form of electronic communication maintained by such delivery service pursuant to subdivision a of this section, or through any other means that such contracted delivery worker and such delivery service agree to. The parties shall have 15 days after commencing such informal resolution process to reach a resolution, unless such contracted delivery worker and such delivery service mutually agree to a longer timeframe. If the parties resolve a challenge pursuant to this subdivision, they shall memorialize such resolution in a written agreement, on a form provided by the department.\n      c. A failure by a delivery service to engage in an informal resolution process as described in this section shall not be subject to a civil penalty under this chapter.\n      � 20-1538 Reporting; records; information. a.
