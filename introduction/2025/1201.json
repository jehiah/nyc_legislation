  "Summary": "This bill would update an existing local law on the prevention of interference with access to reproductive health care facilities, by prohibiting activities that prevent access to facilities offering gender-affirming care. Unlawful actions may subject a person to criminal charges or civil suits. The bill would update cross-references to this local law that exist in another section of the Administrative Code. This bill would also expand a person’s private right of action for interference with reproductive or endocrine medical care when a lawsuit is commenced against the person on the basis of this care, to explicitly include all forms of gender-affirming care. Along with expanding this private right of action, the relevant chapter of the Administrative Code is redesignated to prevent confusion with an identically numbered chapter.",
