  "Summary": "This bill would establish a prohibition of an adult-use cannabis retail dispensary being located within 500 feet of a public youth facility. “Public youth facility” is defined by New York State regulations as a location owned by a government that is accessible to the public with a primary purpose to provide recreational opportunities or services to children or adolescents, where the primary population is reasonably expected to be 17 years of age or younger. The bill would require the Commissioner of Consumer and Worker Protection to notify the New York State Office of Cannabis Management (OCM) of the prohibition for enforcement purposes and to establish outreach efforts to inform dispensaries and dispensary license applicants of the prohibition. The prohibition would not apply to a dispensary with a valid license as of the law’s effective date or to a dispensary license applicant with a location approved by OCM as of the law’s effective date.",
