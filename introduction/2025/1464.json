  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) and the Human Resources Administration (HRA) to create a mechanism that allows documents that relate to public assistance and are required for applying for an affordable housing unit to appear in a public assistance recipient’s Housing Connect account upon request. The bill would require that HPD and HRA consult with the Office of Information Privacy to ensure that this document transmission system would comply with applicable privacy laws and regulations.",
