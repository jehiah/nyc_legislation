  "Summary": "This bill would permit certain small, mixed-use buildings that lack adequate storage space to obtain waivers from rules issued by the Department of Sanitation (DSNY) requiring buildings with up to 9 dwelling units to set out refuse in rigid receptacles with tight-fitting lids. DSNY would be required to approve or deny any waiver application within 60 days, and a denial could be appealed to the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings. Any building granted a waiver would be required to post a sign on their building indicating a waiver has been granted. Any notice of violation (NOV) issued to a building with a pending waiver application would be dismissed, and any building that is improperly issued an NOV after being granted a waiver would be able to recover reasonable costs and attorney’s fees. DSNY would also be required to conduct an education campaign on such waivers, and to report on whether any buildings granted a waiver are suitable for an on-street container pilot program.",

Pilot program report. No later than January 1, 2027, the commissioner shall submit a report to the mayor and the speaker of the council regarding whether any group of buildings granted a waiver pursuant to paragraph 4 of this subdivision may be suitable for participation in an on-street container pilot program. \n      9. Any notice of violation issued to a building with 9 or fewer dwelling units for failure to set out refuse in rigid receptacles with tight-fitting lids shall be dismissed if such building had submitted a waiver application pursuant to paragraph 4 of this subdivision prior the issuance of such notice of violation and, at the time such notice of violation was issued, the department had not issued a determination on such application pursuant to paragraph 5 of this subdivision.\n      10.
