  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) housing portal to provide users with notification by e-mail and text of any update to their applications. This bill would also require the housing portal to permit a user to designate a representative who would receive notifications of any update to the user’s application, new information posted about a unit selected by the user, a new unit available that matches the user’s prescribed criteria, and any other information deemed appropriate by HPD. The designated representative would also be permitted to create a housing portal account to receive these notifications.",
