  "Summary": "This bill would require the Commissioner of Veterans' Services, in consultation with the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene, to conduct a one-year feasibility study on implementing a pilot program to provide Reconsolidation of Traumatic Memories therapy to Veterans residing in the city. The study would evaluate whether this therapy is recommended for Veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder or other psychological disorders, estimate how many Veterans could benefit from such a program, analyze the costs of implementation, evaluate potential funding sources or partnerships, and determine whether the pilot program should proceed based on the findings. Within six months after completing the study, the Commissioner would develop recommendations on the feasibility and advisability of implementing the pilot program, submit such recommendations to the Mayor and the Speaker, and post such recommendations on the department's website.",
