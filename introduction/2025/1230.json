  "Summary": "This bill would require the Director of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability to conduct a study to assess the risk of infrastructure failures due to increased flood occurrences and future residential development in areas at risk of flooding. The director would be required to create an infrastructure risk score metric based on infrastructure, flooding, and development factors, and assign risk scores to at least 10 zones of flood risk area. The director would publish the study 24 months after the bill took effect.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. a. Definitions. As used in this local law, the following terms have the following meanings:\n      Director. The term \"director\" means the director of long-term planning and sustainability.\n      Flood risk area. The term \"flood risk area\" includes the coastal flood risk area and the 10-year rainfall flood risk area as defined in section 24-809 of the administrative code of the city of New York.\n      Infrastructure service disruption. The term \"infrastructure service disruption\" means a temporary or permanent interruption in the provision of a utility or other infrastructure service. Infrastructure service disruptions include, but are not limited to, water main breaks, sewer backups, road closures, transit interruptions, electricity outages, and telecommunication outages.\n      Residential development. The term \"residential development\" means construction of any residential building, residential facility, or residential structure which creates at least one dwelling unit. \n      b. The director, in consultation with other relevant agencies or offices of the city, shall conduct a study to assess the risk of infrastructure service disruptions in flood risk areas due to increased flood occurrences and residential development. Such study shall create an infrastructure risk scoring system that represents the risk of infrastructure service disruptions, and assigns infrastructure risk scores to at least 10 zones of contiguous flood risk area that shall be determined by the director, such that the zones collectively encompass the entire flood risk area. The director shall assign each zone an infrastructure risk score representing the risk of infrastructure service disruptions for each of the following levels of possible residential development: (i) the maximum residential development permitted by zoning regulations, as compared to the current level of residential development; (ii) 75 percent increased residential development permitted by zoning regulations, as compared to the current level of residential development; (iii) 50 percent increased residential development permitted by zoning regulations, as compared to the current level of residential development; and (iv) 25 percent increased residential development permitted by zoning regulations, as compared to the current level of residential development. For the purposes of developing a methodology for such infrastructure risk score, the director shall consider but need not be limited to factors such as:\n      1.  The condition of infrastructure, which shall include, but need not be limited to, roadways, transit systems, water mains, sewers, waste water treatment facilities, electric and telecommunication lines, and gas pipelines; \n      2. The frequency and severity of historical infrastructure service disruptions caused by flood events;\n      3. The likely impacts of sea level rise and flood events on the condition of such infrastructure; and\n      4. The likely impacts of future residential development permitted by zoning regulations on the condition of such infrastructure.\n      c. Within 24 months after this local law takes effect, the director shall submit the study required pursuant to subdivision b to the mayor and the speaker of the council, and make such study publicly available on the website of the office of long-term planning and sustainability.\n      ï¿½ 2. This local law takes effect immediately.\n\n\n\nNNB\nLS #18751\n3/31/2025 9:51 PM\n\n      2\n      \n      \n      1",
