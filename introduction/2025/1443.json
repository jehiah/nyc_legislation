  "Summary": "This bill would require that minimum percentages of rental housing financed by the City are affordable to households with the least means to afford housing.  Of the new affordable housing financed by the Department of Housing and Preservation Development, known as HPD, 50% would have to be affordable to extremely and very low-income households with at least 30% affordable to extremely low-income households.  Although the bill would go into effect immediately, the requirements would not apply until July 1, 2027, so that affordable housing projects currently seeking financing can proceed with their applications.  The legislation would also include an ability for HPD to suspend the targets if federal resources relied on to finance affordable housing are significantly decreased.",
