  "Summary": "This bill would require New York City agencies that operate homeless shelters and that contract with vendors to feed homeless shelter residents to initially pay the vendors at least $15 per day for the provision of each shelter resident’s food. This dollar amount would be adjusted annually for inflation. Where a homeless shelter is operated by an organization pursuant to a contract with an agency, the agency would have to pay the organization at least $15 per day for the provision of each shelter resident’s food, regardless of whether the organization itself provides the food or subcontracts for food provision. This dollar amount would be adjusted annually for inflation. The bill would only apply to contracts executed or renewed after the bill’s effective date.",
