  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to provide several kinds of maternal health-related information to two populations. First, the bill would require DOHMH to provide information aimed at the public on topics like healthy living and nutrition during and after pregnancy and managing chronic diseases during and after pregnancy.  Second, the bill would require DOHMH to provide information specifically to non-obstetric healthcare providers on topics aimed at helping them treat pregnant and postpartum patients.  This includes information on best practices for caring for patients with chronic diseases during and after pregnancy.",
