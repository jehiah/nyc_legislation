  "Summary": "This bill would remove all partisan elections for city elected offices. Similar to how special elections for city elected offices are currently conducted, all elections for city office would be by a non-partisan general election. Petitioning to become candidates for any city elected office would follow the independent nominating petition process. All elections for city offices would be conducted using ranked choice voting.",

The term \"highest rank\" refers to the highest rank whether that be rank number 1, rank number 2, rank number 3, rank number 4, or rank number 5.\n      Last place candidate. The term \"last place candidate\" means a continuing candidate with the fewest votes in a round.\n      Rank.
