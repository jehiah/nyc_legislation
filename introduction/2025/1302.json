  "Summary": "This bill would require the Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability to quadrennially publish the long-term energy plan and the climate adaptation plan within its update to the long-term sustainability plan. The requirements of the long-term sustainability plan would be further amended to remove the requirement that it include a wind resource assessment. The bill would also dissolve the energy policy advisory subcommittee and the climate change adaptation task force and would transfer some of the responsibilities of these entities to the sustainability advisory board, which would now be required to include a representative of the energy industry. Finally, the bill would amend the reporting requirements of the New York City Panel on Climate Change and remove the prohibition on members of that panel receiving financial compensation.",
