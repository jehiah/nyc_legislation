  "Summary": "This bill would prohibit private employers from considering whether an individual has received a vaccination when hiring, terminating employment, or setting the terms and conditions of employment. The bill contains several exceptions for certain settings and circumstances: Employers would be permitted to require employee vaccination in health care settings, some child care settings, where the employee works in the employer’s home, and to ensure compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other applicable federal and state laws. In addition, the bill would not apply to government employers. Finally, the bill would authorize administrative remedies for violations, as well as a private right of action.",
