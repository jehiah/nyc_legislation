  "Summary": "This bill would require the New York City Human Resources Administration (HRA) to issue duplicate transit benefit cards under the Fair Fares NYC program where a participant’s card was damaged, destroyed, stolen, or lost. HRA would be required to provide one replacement card free of charge, but would charge a fee of $15 for any subsequent replacement cards. The bill would prohibit HRA from limiting the number of requests of a duplicate card a participant could make, provided they pay the $15 fee.",
