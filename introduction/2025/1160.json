  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation (“DOT”) to ensure, where practicable, that pavement markings or temporary markings are installed on a street within 5 business days after the street is resurfaced. This bill would also require an annual report on March 1 of each year from DOT to the mayor and the speaker of the council on the number of streets where pavement markings were installed, the percentage of such streets where pavement markings or temporary markings were installed within 5 business days after resurfacing, and for any resurfacing where pavement markings or temporary markings were not installed within 5 business days, the reason for the delay. The requirement for the installation of markings within 5 business days will take effect at the same time that the resurfacing timeline in Proposed Int. No. 552-A takes effect, while the annual reporting requirement will take effect at the same time that the notice requirement in Proposed Int. No. 552-A takes effect.",
