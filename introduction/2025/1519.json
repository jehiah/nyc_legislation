  "Summary": "This bill would set a local hourly minimum wage for all employees and an equivalent hourly minimum pay standard for all independent contractors, including those whose work is directed by digital labor platforms. For both worker classifications, the bill sets the hourly minimum at $25 for workers who receive qualifying benefits and $30 for those who do not. The bill would require the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) to annually calculate increases to the pay standards following an analysis of measures of inflation, and to determine and annually revise the value of qualifying benefits. DCWP would have discretion to establish or continue existing industry- or platform-specific methods of calculating hourly minimum pay for independent contractors, provided that those methods produce hourly pay in compliance with the relevant minimum pay standard.",

Each year the commissioner shall analyze and revise the valuation of qualifying benefits as needed.\n      � 20-1603 Annual minimum wage adjustment. a. No later than September 1 of each year the commissioner shall conduct an analysis to determine the amount by which the minimum wage should be adjusted for the following year.

An employer's failure to maintain, retain, or produce a record or other information required to be maintained by this chapter and requested by the department in furtherance of an investigation conducted pursuant to this chapter that is relevant to a material fact alleged in a notice of violation issued pursuant to this chapter creates a rebuttable presumption that such fact is true.\n      � 20-1609 Administrative enforcement. a.
