  "Summary": "This bill would amend the City’s Earned Safe and Sick Time Act adding paid bereavement time when any family member of an employee dies from a firearm related death. The time would be paid at the employee’s regular pay rate and would be in addition to the employee’s accrual or use of existing safe/sick time. It would be required to be paid by the next regular pay date. Within certain limits, an employer could require that within 7 days an employee provide documentation that the death occurred. An employer could not require the employee to work additional hours to make up for the original hours the employee was unavailable, or find a replacement employee to cover their hours, due to the employee’s use of the time. The bill would provide relief and penalties for a failure to provide this time. The local law would take effect 120 days after it becomes law except that the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection would be required to promulgate rules as necessary to give effect to the law prior to this date.",

An employer required to provide paid safe/sick time pursuant to this chapter who provides an employee with an amount of paid leave, including paid time off, paid vacation, paid personal days or paid days of rest required to be compensated pursuant to subdivision 1 of section 161 of the labor law, sufficient to meet the requirements of this section and who allows such paid leave to be used for the same purposes and under the same conditions as safe/sick time required pursuant to this chapter, is not required to provide additional paid safe/sick time for such employee whether or not such employee chooses to use such leave for the purposes included in section 20-914 of this chapter.

The provisions of this chapter do not apply to (i) work study programs under 42 U.S.C. section 2753, (ii) employees for the hours worked and compensated by or through qualified scholarships as defined in 26 U.S.C. section 117, (iii) independent contractors who do not meet the definition of employee under subdivision 2 of section 190 of the labor law, and (iv) hourly professional employees. \n      g.

For employees of employers with [ninety-nine] 99 or fewer employees, up to [forty] 40 hours of unused safe/sick time as provided pursuant to this chapter shall be carried over to the following calendar year, and for employees of employers with [one hundred] 100 or more employees, up to [fifty-six] 56 hours of unused safe/sick time as provided pursuant to this chapter shall be carried over to the following calendar year; provided that no employer with [ninety-nine] 99 or fewer employees shall be required to (i) allow the use of more than [forty] 40 hours of safe/sick time in a calendar year or (ii) carry over unused paid safe/sick time if the employee is paid for any unused safe/sick time at the end of the calendar year in which such time is accrued and the employer provides the employee with an amount of paid safe/sick time that meets or exceeds the requirements of this chapter for such employee for the immediately subsequent calendar year on the first day of such year; and further provided that no employer with [one hundred] 100 or more employees shall be required to (i) allow the use of more than [fifty-six] 56 hours of safe/sick time in a calendar year or (ii) carry over unused paid safe/sick time if the employee is paid for any unused safe/sick time at the end of the calendar year in which such time is accrued and the employer provides the employee with an amount of paid safe/sick time that meets or exceeds the requirements of this chapter for such employee for the immediately subsequent calendar year on the first day of such year.\n      i. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as requiring financial or other reimbursement to an employee from an employer upon the employee's termination, resignation, retirement, or other separation from employment for accrued safe/sick time that has not been used.\n      j. If an employee is transferred to a separate division, entity or location in the city[ of New York], but remains employed by the same employer, such employee is entitled to all safe/sick time accrued at the prior division, entity or location and is entitled to retain or use all safe/sick time as provided pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. When there is a separation from employment and the employee is rehired within [six] 6 months of separation by the same employer, previously accrued safe/sick time that was not used shall be reinstated and such employee shall be entitled to use such accrued safe/sick time at any time after such employee is rehired, provided that no employer shall be required to reinstate such safe/sick time to the extent the employee was paid for unused accrued safe/sick time prior to separation and the employee agreed to accept such pay for such unused safe/sick time. \n      � 3. Chapter 8 of title 20 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 20-913.1 to read as follows:\n      � 20-913.1 Right to bereavement time following firearm related death. a. An employee is entitled to bereavement time for absence of work pursuant to this section if any family member of the employee dies from a firearm related death.   \n      b. An employee's entitlement to bereavement time pursuant to this section is available from the start date of the employee's employment or the effective date of this local law that created this entitlement, whichever is later.\n      c. An employer must pay an employee for bereavement time at the employee's regular rate of pay at the time the bereavement time is taken, provided that the rate of pay cannot be less than the highest applicable rate of pay to which the employee would be entitled pursuant to subdivision 1 of section 652 of the labor law, or any other applicable federal, state, or local law, rule, contract, or agreement.
