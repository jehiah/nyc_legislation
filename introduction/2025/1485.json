  "Summary": "This bill would require the Director of the Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability to study and report on the feasibility and impact of locating data centers in New York City. The Director would be required to identify potential sites in the city where data centers could operate and consider the impact that data centers would have on the electric grid, water supply, utility rates, long-term sustainability and energy plans, economy, and nearby residents’ quality of life. The Director would also be required to recommend changes to local law or the zoning resolution to facilitate the building of data centers, and propose solutions to minimize any negative effects of data centers on the city or its residents. Within 1 year of the law’s effective date, the Director would be required to submit a report containing the findings and recommendations of the study to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council and post a copy of the report on the City’s website.",
