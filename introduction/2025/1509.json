  "Summary": "This bill would establish an Office of Conversion Assistance. The Office would, in part, provide technical assistance to developers and owners seeking to convert non-residential space into residential units, maintain an online portal for this purpose, collaborate with New York City agencies on issues related to conversion, liaise with federal and New York State authorities on these issues, identify conditions in the City that slow down or obstruct conversions, and collect data on conversions in the City. The Office would also provide an annual report on fulfillment of its duties to the Speaker of the Council, Mayor, and Public Advocate that it would also post online. This report must include recommendations for addressing conditions in the City that are adverse to conversions.",
