  "Summary": "This bill would reopen the lookback window to the Gender-Motivated Violence Act (GMVA), commencing on March 1, 2026 and closing on March 1, 2027, thereby extending the statute of limitations and giving survivors of gender-motivated acts of violence more time to pursue civil actions. In addition to allowing for claim revival under the existing GMVA, the bill addresses retroactivity during the lookback window, as claims may be brought against any individual or entity for acts committed before the GMVA’s substantive amendment in 2022, including before the passage of the GMVA in 2000.",

A civil action under this chapter shall be commenced within seven years after the alleged crime of violence motivated by gender occurred.

Notwithstanding any provision of law that imposes a period of limitation to the contrary, any civil claim or cause of action [brought] under this chapter that is barred because the applicable period of limitation has expired is hereby revived; and any claim or cause of action under this chapter, regardless of whether such claim or cause of action is against an individual or any other party, that would have accrued after December 19, 2000 and before January 9, 2022, and any claim or cause of action under this chapter, regardless of whether such claim or cause of action is against an individual or any other party, that would have accrued on or before December 19, 2000, is hereby actionable.
