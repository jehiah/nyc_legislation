  "Summary": "This bill would bar federal immigration authorities from maintaining offices or quarters, for any purpose, on land over which the New York City Department of Correction (DOC) exercises jurisdiction. It would explicitly supersede any conflicting mayoral executive order or memorandum of understanding entered into by New York City. Finally, it would amend several definitions in the Administrative Code to account for current immigration enforcement practices.",
