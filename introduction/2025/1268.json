  "Summary": "This bill would require the commissioner of the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs (MOIA), in consultation with the New York City Law Department, to develop signage that clearly describes the legal protections enacted in sections 4-210, 10-178, 21-977, and 23-1202 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York. The signage would also clearly identify examples of nonpublic areas of city property and list the rights individuals may invoke when interacting with federal immigration authorities. The MOIA commissioner would prepare the signage in plain language, translate it into multiple languages, and make it available to city agencies. City agencies would conspicuously post the signage, and the MOIA commissioner would conduct outreach regarding the contents of the signage.",
