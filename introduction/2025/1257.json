  "Summary": "This bill would require the Commissioner of the New York City (“City” or “NYC”) Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (“DOHMH Commissioner”) to identify the 10 most common neurological conditions and the 10 most common mental health conditions affecting older adults and to transmit this information to the Commissioner of the NYC Department for the Aging (“DFTA Commissioner”). The DFTA Commissioner, in collaboration with City agencies that frequently interact with older adults, would then study and issue a one-time report on the provision of City agency services to older adults with these conditions. Such report would include actions that City agencies will take in response to the study to improve services for older adults living with the neurological conditions and mental health conditions identified by the DOHMH Commissioner.",
