  "Summary": "This bill would require the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene to identify the 10 most common neurological conditions and the 10 most common mental health conditions affecting older adults and to transmit this information to the Chair of the Cabinet for Older New Yorkers. This Chair would have to then study and issue a one-time report on the provision of New York City (City) agency services to older adults with these conditions. Such report would include actions that City agencies will take in response to the study to improve services for older adults living with the identified neurological conditions and mental health conditions.",
