A deduction from the reported annual building emissions  resulting from the consumption of electricity may be authorized equal to the number of renewable energy credits purchased by or on behalf of a building owner, provided (i) the renewable energy resource that is the source of the renewable energy credits is considered by the New York independent system operator to be a capacity resource located in, or whose output directly sinks into, the zone J load zone for the reporting calendar year; (ii) the renewable energy credits are solely owned and retired by, or on behalf of, the building owner; (iii) the renewable energy credits are from the same year as the reporting year; [and] (iv) the building that hosts the system producing the energy does not receive a deduction under section 28-320.3.6.3 for the same energy upon which the renewable credits are based; and (v) the maximum allowable renewable energy credit deduction per building is no more than 10% of a building's emissions in excess of the total annual building emissions limit, as prescribed by section 28-320.3.
