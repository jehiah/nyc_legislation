  "Summary": "This bill would require the Fire Commissioner to provide written notice to Fire Department employees when providing any firefighting personal protective equipment that the Fire Commissioner knows or reasonably should know contains perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). This bill would also require that the Fire Commissioner only provide Fire Department employees with firefighting personal protective equipment that the Commissioner knows does not contain intentionally added PFAS and does not contain PFAS at or above a level set by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation by regulation. This restriction would commence on January 1, 2028 or later, and would apply to the extent the Fire Commissioner determines practicable. Finally, this bill would require the Fire Commissioner to document each instance of failure to comply with the provisions of this bill in the Fire Department’s personnel orders until the Fire Commissioner takes corrective action.",
