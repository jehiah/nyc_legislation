  "Summary": "This bill would eliminate the commissioner of finance’s general grant of authority to sell tax liens through December 31, 2028, and would instead impose ongoing conditions on the commissioner’s sale of tax liens. Competitive sales of tax liens would require approval by resolution of the council. Negotiated sales of tax liens to a city land bank would be authorized, and negotiated sales of tax liens to any other entity would require approval by resolution of the council. Additionally, this bill would subject any sale of tax liens to the term and condition that no purchaser of a tax lien may foreclose upon a lien encumbering a property owned by a primary resident and comprised of 1-3 dwelling units until the value of the lien reaches the lesser amount of 20% of the property value or $200,000, as well as the term and condition that every purchaser shall regularly send bills of the amount due on the lien and other pertinent information to the property owner.",

(i) The commissioner of finance may[, in his or her discretion,] sell a tax lien or tax liens through a competitive sale upon the adoption of a resolution by the council approving such sale. Upon the commissioner's determination that a competitive sale of a tax lien or tax liens would be in the best interests of the city, the commissioner of finance shall submit to the council a request for authorization to sell a tax lien or tax liens through a competitive sale. Such request shall set forth: a description of the tax lien or liens proposed for sale; the proposed terms and conditions of such sale including, but not limited to, terms and conditions intended to exclude purchasers with a demonstrated history of poor property management; an explanation of the proposed sale's impact on housing preservation; and the details of the commissioner's determination that a competitive sale would be in the best interests of the city.

Such notice shall be published in one newspaper of general circulation in the city, not less than fifteen days prior to the date designated by the commissioner for the receipt of statements of interest, or if the negotiated sale is to such trust or other entity, then such notice shall be published not less than fifteen days prior to the date of sale.
