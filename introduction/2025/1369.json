  "Summary": "This bill would amend the City’s Earned Safe and Sick Time Act adding an employee entitlement to 5 hours annually of paid preventative medical screening time for absence of work to obtain preventative medical care such as routine or preventative medical treatment, diagnosis, screening, check-up, or patient counseling to identify or prevent illnesses, disease, or other health problems. The time would be paid at the employee’s regular pay rate and be in addition to their accrual or use of existing safe/sick time. It would not require accrual. It would be required to be paid by the next regular pay date. Within certain limits, an employer could require reasonable documentation from the employee on the use of the time. An employer could not require the employee to work additional hours to make up for the original hours the employee was unavailable, or find a replacement employee to cover their hours, due to the employee’s use of the time. The bill would provide relief and penalties for a failure to provide this time. The local law would take effect 120 days after it becomes law except that the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection must promulgate rules as necessary to give effect to the law prior to this date.",

Chapter 8 of title 20 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 20-913.1 to read as follows:\n      � 20-913.1 Right to preventative medical screening time. a.

Where a health care provider charges an employee a fee for the provision of documentation requested by their employer, such employer shall reimburse the employee for such fee.\n      � 6.

An employer shall reimburse an employee for all reasonable costs or expenses incurred for the purpose of obtaining such documentation for an employer.\n      � 8.

Where such need is foreseeable, an employer may require reasonable advance notice of the intention to use such [safe/sick] time, not to exceed [seven] 7 days prior to the date such [safe/sick] time is to begin. Where such need is not foreseeable, an employer may require an employee to provide notice of the need for the use of the [safe/sick] time as soon as practicable.\n         d. Nothing herein shall prevent an employer from requiring an employee to provide written confirmation that an employee used safe/sick time, or preventative medical screening time pursuant to this section.\n         e. An employer shall not require an employee, as a condition of taking safe/sick time, or preventative medical screening time to search for or find a replacement worker to cover the hours during which such employee is utilizing time.\n         f.
