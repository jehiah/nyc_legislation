  "Summary": "This bill would increase expenditure limits for candidates participating in the City’s campaign finance program if independent expenditures in an election exceed certain levels. Under the bill, when independent expenditures exceed 50 percent of the expenditure limit in a covered election, the expenditure limit for all candidates in that election would increase by 50 percent. When independent expenditures exceed 100 percent of the expenditure limit in a covered election, the expenditure limit for all candidates in that election would be lifted completely.",
