  "Summary": "This bill would establish an Office of Community Board Support within the Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) or another agency the mayor deems appropriate. The office would be required to assist community boards with finding accessible public meeting spaces and permanent office spaces. The office would also be required to conduct regular assessments regarding the physical needs of community board offices and help with any needed repairs or upgrades to the offices. The bill would also remove a requirement that borough presidents provide community boards with meeting places upon request since this would now be DCAS or the designated agency’s responsibility.",
