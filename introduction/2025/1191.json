  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Social Services (DSS) to conduct a study of the 2010e supportive housing application to determine which parts of the application are mandated by federal or state law or through contractual agreements. The study would review all questions, evaluations, interviews, and documentation requirements in the application, identifying any items that are not legally required. Following the study, DSS would be required to remove non-mandated items from the application. The bill would also prohibit DSS from requiring any information or documentation in the supportive housing application unless that information or documentation is mandated by federal, state, or local law, or through contractual agreements with state or federal entities.",
