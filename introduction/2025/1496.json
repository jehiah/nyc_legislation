  "Summary": "This bill would require the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to develop and implement a public education campaign about traumatic brain injuries (TBIs), including concussions and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The campaign must explain symptoms, risks, and which groups face higher risk, such as athletes, youth in sports, military personnel, emergency responders, law enforcement, and certain workers, as well as provide information on accessing concussion testing in the city. DOHMH must share state guidance for schools, offer tips for parents of youth athletes, and provide resources for private sports leagues. The department must make materials available online and in citywide languages, target high-risk groups, update materials at least every three years, and use multiple forms of outreach. The bill also requires DOHMH to create and offer a concussion and TBI training program for all city agencies. DOHMH must publish an annual report on TBIs and concussions among employees in higher-risk city occupations, along with recommendations to reduce these injuries.",
