  "Summary": "This bill seeks to codify the Mayor’s Office of Food Policy’s (MOFP) outreach and meeting schedule. This law would mandate MOFP to meet with agencies, community based organizations, community leaders and other stakeholders that focus on food policy issues every 3 months. These discussions would no longer be limited to the food policy plan. Furthermore, MOFP would have to perform outreach to these organizations every 3 months. The bill seeks to enhance communication between different interested parties, and ensure that food policy issues are addressed in a timely manner.",
