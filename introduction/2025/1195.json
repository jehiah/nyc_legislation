  "Summary": "This bill would require the Commissioner of Transportation to conduct a one-year study and implement a five-year plan concerning the installation of tactile paving on sidewalks in New York City. The study would involve the identification of high-priority City blocks for installation based on specific criteria, evaluation of best practices from other jurisdictions, consultation with disability advocacy groups, and evaluation of existing City laws regarding sidewalk maintenance and liability. Based on the study’s findings, the Commissioner would develop and implement a plan, to be submitted to the Mayor and Speaker of the Council and posted online, that includes a schedule for installation, a budget, design standards, guidelines on maintenance responsibility and liability, and public outreach strategies. The Commissioner would have to submit annual progress reports on plan implementation to the Mayor and the Speaker and post these reports online.",
