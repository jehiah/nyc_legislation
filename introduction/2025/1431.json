  "Summary": "This bill would set requirements for when and how police officers can engage in high-speed vehicle pursuits, require publication of footage from vehicle pursuits, and require an annual report on pursuits. No more than two units would be permitted to engage in a pursuit. Officers would be prohibited from engaging in a pursuit unless certain requirements were met, and would be required to get authorization from their supervisor to initiate the pursuit prior to initiating that pursuit. The bill would prohibit officers from using tactical vehicle intervention, also known as the PIT maneuver, and require training for other intervention techniques prior to engaging in them. The bill would establish guidelines for police when aerial support is used or when outside agencies request their assistance in their own high-speed vehicle pursuits. The bill also would require that all pursuits are reviewed by the commissioner and a board convened by the commissioner.",
