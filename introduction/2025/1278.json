  "Summary": "This bill would require the New York City Department of Sanitation (“DSNY”) to implement a pilot program for the use of power washing machines to clean and remove odors and spills from sidewalk surfaces in commercial corridors.

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. The department of sanitation shall establish and implement a pilot program for at least 6 months for the use of power washing machines to clean and remove odors and spills from sidewalks that are located in a commercial corridor. Such pilot program shall commence upon the selection of suitable locations, but no later than April 1, 2026. The department of sanitation shall consult with the department of environmental protection prior to choosing the locations for the pilot program. The department of sanitation shall provide to the mayor and speaker of the council a report on such pilot program upon its conclusion. Such report shall include an evaluation of whether and where the power washing pilot program is suitable for expansion, guidelines for how many miles of sidewalk within commercial corridors should be power washed per year, and an evaluation of the impact that pedestrian volume and susceptibility to heat island effects has on feasibility and desirability of using power washing machines to clean sidewalk surfaces in such locations. \n      � 2. For purposes of this local law, the following terms have the following meanings:\n      Sidewalk. The term \"sidewalk\" has the same meaning as set forth in section 19-101 of the administrative code of the city of New York.\n      Power washing machine.
