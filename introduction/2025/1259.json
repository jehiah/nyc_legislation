  "Summary": "This bill would require that all direct service staff employed at juvenile detention facilities who are not professionally certified or licensed in mental health, behavioral analysis, medicine, or a similar field, to complete foundational training in behavioral support strategies. Such strategies include de-escalation and crisis prevention techniques, guidance on incorporating trauma-informed and culturally competent practices when addressing challenging behaviors, as well as basic principles for encouraging positive behaviors and learning. The bill would also require the commissioner of the Administration for Children’s Services (ACS) to make the trainings, informational materials, and guidance available to providers who work directly with youth involved in the juvenile justice system.",
