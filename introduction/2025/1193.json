  "Summary": "This bill would require home improvement contractors disclose in writing to owners whether there are any permits foreseeably required to perform the work specified in the contract and, if so, which permits are required and who is responsible for obtaining them, what actions need to be taken to obtain the permits, and how owners can verify the status of any permits. The bill would also require the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) to conduct an outreach and education campaign to raise awareness of these new requirements and would require the Department of Buildings (DOB) to conduct an outreach and education campaign on the watch list of contractors who have performed work without the required permits.",
