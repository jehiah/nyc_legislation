  "Summary": "Under current city law property owners or their agents are required to disclose whether they will obtain a tenant screening report that may report on a prospective tenant’s credit, criminal record, history in housing court, or other factors. If the applicant is denied, the landlord or agent must disclose that the denial was based on such a report and instruct the applicant on how to obtain a copy of the report. This bill would require the landlord or agent to also provide applicants with the criteria they use to reject applicants based on the tenant screening reports.",
