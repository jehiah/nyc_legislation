  "Summary": "This bill would require entities that contract with certain New York City agencies (City contractors) to report pay and employment information for their employees to the Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS). DCAS would be required to provide such data to the Mayor’s Office of Data Analytics (MODA), and MODA would have to provide such data to the Council. MODA would also be required to issue to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council an annual report that includes data showing employees of City contractors by contractor, pay band, racial group, ethnicity, and gender. MODA and DCAS would be required to conduct an annual analysis, to be included in MODA’s reports, of the pay and employment data for employees of City contractors in order to identify potential disparities based on gender, race, or other protected classes identified in the City’s Human Rights Law. Finally, DCAS would be required to post an anonymized report describing this analysis annually on its website.",
