The Commissioner would have to solicit feedback from the Council Member and Borough President for an additional 15 or 30 days after the end of the relevant public comment period. The Commissioner would be required to review comments and feedback before ruling on an application, as permitted by federal law or regulation, and to publish a final determination notice online.",
