  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\nSection 1. Declaration of Legislative Findings.  While most bars, restaurants and other businesses in New York City are responsible community members, some have little consideration for their residential neighbors.  The fact that many people are drawn to New York City’s nightlife is a good thing, since it contributes to our vibrant cultural life and economy.  However, the quality of life in residential neighborhoods suffers when commercial establishments do not responsibly manage noise.  \nThe Council finds that Council oversight and public disclosure of noise complaints and violations pertaining to these facilities can help address this problem by both encouraging compliance with the City’s noise requirements and ensuring that City agencies are doing their part to resolve these noise-related matters.  \n§2. Title 24 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding thereto a new section 24-231.1 to read as follows:\n§24-231.1 Reporting of noise complaints and violations. a. The department shall, in coordination with the police department and the board, submit a monthly report to the speaker of the council, on or before the 10th day of each month, which shall include, but not be limited to, the following information for the month preceding such report date:  \n(1) The names and addresses of the fifty commercial establishments or enterprises receiving the greatest number of complaints concerning noise, as recorded by the 311 telephone information system, and for each such establishment or enterprise, the number of complaints received, the number of distinct individuals placing such complaints, and whether each such establishment or enterprise remains in operation as of the last day of the reporting period for which such report is made.  \n(2) The names and addresses of the fifty commercial establishments or enterprises receiving the greatest number of notices of violation for violating a provision of this chapter, and for each such establishment or enterprise, the total number of such notices received, the number of such notices that resulted in a fine, the average fines both assessed and paid for such violations, and whether each such establishment or enterprise remains in operation as of the last day of the reporting period for which such report is made.  \nb. The reports required pursuant to subdivision a of this section shall be published on the official website of the city of New York and disseminated through such other means that the commissioner deems sufficient to make such information readily available to the public.\n§3.
