  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\nSection 1.  Statement of legislative findings and intent.  The alteration or modification of existing buildings designated for industrial or manufacturing  uses to create illegal housing units is increasingly occurring throughout the City.  Such modifications sometimes occur due to ignorance of the law but are often blatant efforts to thwart the law.  The illegal conversion of buildings designated for industrial or manufacturing uses for the purpose of residential occupancy reduces the availability of valuable space from the City’s remaining inventory of buildings designated for industrial or manufacturing uses.  These illegal conversions result in increased costs for  the leasing of space for industrial or manufacturing uses and increases the risk of further displacement of jobs in this sector, a crucial component of the City’s economy. This legislation will empower our code enforcement officials and allow the issuance of multiple violations by assessing a penalty per residential unit in illegally converted buildings and increasing the penalties for violations.\n§2.  Subdivision a of section 26-126.1 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 65 for the year 1997, is amended, and a new subdivision f is added, to read as follows:\n\t\ta.  In addition to or as an alternative to any of the remedies and penalties provided in subchapters one, two and three of chapter one of this title or chapter one of title twenty-seven any person who shall violate or fail to comply with any of the provisions of subchapters one, two and three of chapter one of this title or chapter one of title twenty-seven or the rules and regulations promulgated hereunder shall, except as otherwise specifically provided in subdivision c of section 26-126.2, be liable for a civil penalty which may be recovered in a proceeding before the environmental control board. Such proceeding shall be commenced by the service of a notice of violation returnable before the board. The provisions of sections 26-244, 26-246 and 26-248 relating to notification prior to the commencement of judicial proceedings shall not apply to the recovery of civil penalties in proceedings before the environmental control board. Except as otherwise specifically provided, such civil penalty shall be determined in accordance with the following schedule:\nFirst\nViolation\t Second or Subsequent Violation by the respondent of the same provision of law, rule or regulation and, if the respondent is the owner, agent, lessee or other person in control of the premises with respect to which the violations occurred, at the same premises  (all violations committed within an eighteen month period).\n\nMinimum\tMaximum \tMinimum\tMaximum\n(Dollars)       \t(Dollars)  \t(Dollars)\t(Dollars)\n\n27-118.1(a)………………………    \t\t   250 \t\t2,500 \t\t1,000 \t\t10,000\n27-118.1(b)………………………\t\t2,500\t\t5,000\t\t5000\t\t25,000\n27-508.3(b)……….……………………. \t       0  \t  \t   300 \t\t   350 \t\t  1,000\nAny Provision of subchapter 19 of\nChapter 1 of title 27…………………….                0 \t5,000 \t\t       0 \t\t10,000\n\nAny provisions of subchapters 1,2, and 3                 0 \t 2,500                     0               10,000\nof chapter 1 of this title and all other\nprovisions of chapter 1 of title 27 or any\nprovisions of the zoning resolution and\nrelated rules and regulations…………...\n(Reference to a section of the code is intended to include any rules and regulations related to such section).\n\nf.

Statement of legislative findings and intent.  The alteration or modification of existing buildings designated for industrial or manufacturing  uses to create illegal housing units is increasingly occurring throughout the City.  Such modifications sometimes occur due to ignorance of the law but are often blatant efforts to thwart the law.  The illegal conversion of buildings designated for industrial or manufacturing uses for the purpose of residential occupancy reduces the availability of valuable space from the City\\rquote s remaining inventory of buildings designated for industrial or manufacturing uses.  These illegal conversions result in increased costs for  the leasing of space for industrial or manufacturing uses and increases the risk of further displacement of jobs in this sector, a crucial component of the City\\rquote s economy. This legislation will empower our code enforcement officials and allow the issuance of multiple violations by assessing a penalty per residential unit in illegally converted buildings and increasing the penalties for violations.\\par\n\\'a72.
