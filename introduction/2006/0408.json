Such inspection shall ensure that the water tank complies with all provisions of the administrative code of the city of New York, the construction codes of the city of New York and the health code of the city of New York. The results of such inspection shall be recorded in a manner prescribed by the commissioner. Such results shall be maintained by the owner for at least five years from the date of inspection and shall be made available to the department upon request within five business days. The department shall request such information from the building owner or manager when contacted pursuant to subdivision c of this section. \nc. The owner of a building shall post a notice stating that (i) the water tank inspection results are maintained on file in a specific location and will be made available when a person makes such a request to either the building owner or manager and (ii) that a person may contact the department if the inspection results are not made available to such person by the building owner or manager. Upon receipt of such request, the owner or manager shall make a copy of the inspection results available within five business days. Such notice shall be posted in a location easily accessible to tenants and in a frame with a transparent cover, and may be combined with similar notices where not otherwise prohibited by law.\nd. Beginning March 1, 2010, and each year thereafter for three years, the department shall submit to the council a report which shall provide information about water tank inspections for the preceding calendar year including, but not limited to:\n1. the estimated number of building water tanks and the estimated number of buildings serviced by such tanks;\n2. the number of building water tank inspection results examined by the department and the number that were in compliance with subdivision b of this section;\n3. the estimated compliance rate with subdivision b of this section for the city; and\n4. the number of violations issued by the department pursuant to subdivision e of this section.\ne.
