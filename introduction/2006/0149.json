Any person required by this sub-paragraph to make reasonable accommodation may require a person requesting reasonable accommodation pursuant to this sub-paragraph to provide certification that the person or the person's family or household member is a victim of domestic violence, sex offenses or stalking. The person requesting reasonable accommodation pursuant to this sub-paragraph shall provide a copy of such certification to the employer within a reasonable period after the request is made.  A person may satisfy the certification requirement of this sub-paragraph by providing documentation from an employee, agent, or volunteer of a victim services organization, an attorney, a member of the clergy, or a medical or other professional service provider, from whom the individual seeking a reasonable accommodation or that individual’s family or household member has sought assistance in addressing domestic violence, sex offenses or stalking and the effects of the violence or stalking; a police or court record; or other corroborating evidence.  All information provided to the employer pursuant to this sub-paragraph, including a statement of the person requesting a reasonable accommodation or any other documentation, record, or corroborating evidence, and the fact that the individual has requested or obtained a reasonable accommodation, shall be retained in the strictest confidence by the employer, except to the extent that disclosure is requested or consented to in writing by the person requesting the reasonable accommodation; or otherwise required by applicable federal, state or local law.

The person requesting reasonable accommodation pursuant to this sub-paragraph shall provide a copy of such certification to the owner within a reasonable period after the request is made.  A person may satisfy the certification requirement of this sub-paragraph by providing documentation from an employee, agent, or volunteer of a victim services organization, an attorney, a member of the clergy, or a medical or other professional service provider, from whom the individual seeking a reasonable accommodation or that individual’s family or household member has sought assistance in addressing domestic violence, sex offenses or stalking and the effects of the violence or stalking; a police or court record; or other corroborating evidence.

Affirmative defense in domestic violence, sex offenses or stalking cases. In any case where the need for reasonable accommodation is placed in issue, it shall be an affirmative defense that the person aggrieved by the alleged discriminatory practice could not, with reasonable accommodation, satisfy the essential requisites of the job or enjoy the right or rights in question.\n§2. This local law shall take effect 90 days after enactment.\n\n\nJ.D.S. \nInt. 305/2004",
