Subparagraph iii of paragraph 2 of subdivision b of section 224.1 of the New York city charter is amended to read as follows:\n(iii) Capital projects involving buildings classified in occupancy group G with an estimated construction cost of 12 million dollars ($12,000,000) or more shall be designed and constructed to reduce energy cost by a minimum of twenty percent (20%), as determined by the methodology prescribed in LEED energy and atmosphere credit 1 or the New York state energy conservation code, whichever is more stringent. In addition to such twenty percent (20%) reduction in energy cost, the design agency shall make investments in energy efficiency that reduce energy cost by an additional [five percent (5%) if it finds that the payback on such investment through savings in energy cost would not exceed seven years or, in the alternative, the design agency shall make investments in energy efficiency that reduce energy cost by an additional] ten percent (10%) if it finds that the payback on such [investment] investments through savings in energy cost would not exceed seven years. If the payback for such investments would exceed seven years, then the design agency shall instead make investments in energy efficiency that reduce energy cost by an additional five percent (5%) if the design agency finds that the payback for such investments would not exceed seven years.  In the alternative, if the design agency finds that the payback for such additional five percent investments would exceed seven years, then the design agency shall provide the analyses used to make this determination in the annual report required by section three of local law number 86 for the year 2005.\nÂ§2.
