(a)  Upon the receipt of a rejection of any application for a certificate of occupancy by an employee or inspector of the department or a rejection of a field inspection, an applicant may appeal the rejection in writing through the following process:\n(1)  the applicant can appeal at any time after receipt of the rejection to the chief inspector of the borough in which the application is located.  Upon submission of an appeal, the chief inspector shall have five business days to rule on the appeal.  If the appeal is rejected, the chief inspector shall, with the permission of the applicant, submit an immediate appeal to the borough commissioner;\n(2) if the appeal to the chief inspector results in the affirmance of the rejection or any portion thereof, then the applicant can appeal at any time after receipt of such affirmance to the borough commissioner of the borough in which the application is located.  Upon submission of an appeal, the borough commissioner shall have five business days to rule on the appeal;\n(3)  if the appeal to the borough commissioner results in the affirmance of the rejection or any portion thereof, then the applicant can appeal at any time after receipt of such affirmance to a panel consisting of each of the five borough commissioners.  Upon submission of an appeal, the panel shall notify the applicant of the date of the hearing and provide the applicant with an opportunity to submit supporting materials and to be heard on the date of the hearing.  The panel shall have twenty business days to hear and rule on the appeal;\n(4)if the appeal to the panel results in the affirmance of the rejection or any portion\nthereof, then the applicant can further appeal at any time after receipt of such affirmance to the commissioner, or his or her designee.
