  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection 1.  Legislative findings and intent.  The Council finds that the City lacks a coherent, comprehensive mechanism to assist prospective small business owners launch their enterprises and to nurture the successful growth and development of existing small businesses.  In particular, the fact that multiple licenses may be required from an array of governmental entities, depending upon the type of business envisioned by prospective small business owners, has led to unnecessary confusion and delay in setting up lawful operation in an efficient manner.  In order to encourage small business growth in the City of New York, the Council finds it vitally necessary to create a coordinated mechanism that will be available to prospective small business owners that is specifically designed to facilitate the licensing procedures required for such businesses to quickly open their doors for business.  Such mechanism shall also be available to aid existing small businesses to navigate and adhere to all applicable legal and regulatory mandates incumbent upon such businesses.\n \t§2.
