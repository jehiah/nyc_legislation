  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\nSection one.  Legislative findings and intent.  The Council of the City of New York finds that people who have been convicted of felony gun offenses pose unique dangers to the people of this City and should, therefore, be monitored to prevent them from reoffending and to ensure their prompt apprehension if they do commit further crimes.\nThe New York City Police Department has shown that information about past offenders can be used to prevent future crimes.  The Specially Targeted Offenders Project (STOP) led to 247 arrests of offenders who had violated a duty to report changes in address under the state’s Correction Law from 2003 to 2004, almost doubling the rate of such arrests from the previous year.  \n§2.  A new chapter 6 is hereby added to title 10 of the administrative code of the city of New York to read as follows:\nCHAPTER SIX\nGUN OFFENDER REGISTRATION ACT\n§10-601. Short Title.
