Subchapter 3 of chapter 1 of title 19 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 19-181 to read as follows:\n\t§19-181.  Traffic control devices.  The department shall establish a process by which it evaluates the need for traffic control devices to be placed at intersections within the city of New York.  Criteria to be included in such process shall include, but shall not be limited to, motor vehicle and pedestrian traffic volumes, visibility for both motor vehicle operators and pedestrians, any unique characteristics relevant to the location in question, proximity of existing traffic control devices to the location in question, average vehicular speeds, the frequency and types of accidents involving motor vehicles and pedestrians, including damage to property, at specific intersections based upon information and statistics provided by the police department and insurance companies, the likely presence of school children and bicyclists and the ability to appropriately control traffic flow by implementing other traffic control techniques, such as speed humps or speed limit signs.  Following every evaluation undertaken by the department concerning whether placement of a traffic control device is appropriate, the department shall issue a written finding detailing the analyses upon which its determination was based.  Such written finding shall be provided by the department to any individual, group or organization upon whose request to the department such evaluation was conducted, as well as to the council member in whose district such intersection evaluated is located.  \n\t§2.
