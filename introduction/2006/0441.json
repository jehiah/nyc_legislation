This local law shall take effect ninety days after its enactment; provided that the relevant city agencies shall take all necessary steps, including but not limited to the promulgation of rules, to ensure the prompt implementation of this local law upon its effective date and provided further that section twelve of this local law shall take effect one year after it shall have become a law and provided further that any provisions of this local law that require the city clerk to post information on the internet or keep information in a computerized database or in electronic form shall take date.",
