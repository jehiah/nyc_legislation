Immediately upon receipt of such notification the chief medical examiner, or a deputy chief medical examiner, or [an associate] a medical examiner, [or an assistant medical examiner, or a junior medical examiner] or a medical investigator, or a lay medical investigator shall go to and take charge of the dead body.  Such medical examiner [or], medical investigator or lay medical investigator shall fully investigate the essential facts concerning the circumstances of the death, taking the names and addresses of as many witnesses thereto as it may be practicable to obtain, and[, before leaving the premises,] shall [reduce] record all such facts [to writing] and file the same in [his or her office] the office of chief medical examiner.

If [the investigation of the circumstances and examination of the body enable the medical examiner or medical investigator to conclude] it may be concluded with reasonable certainty that death [had] occurred from natural causes or obvious traumatic injury, and there are no other circumstances which would appear to require an autopsy, the chief medical examiner, deputy chief medical examiner or medical examiner or medical investigator in charge shall certify the cause of death and file a report of his or her findings in the office of chief medical examiner.  If, however, in the opinion of [such] a medical examiner[ or medical investigator], an autopsy is necessary, the same shall be performed by a medical examiner.  Where indicated, the autopsy shall include toxicologic, histologic, microbiologic and serologic examinations.
