  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\nSection 1.  Declaration of legislative findings and intent.  The Council notes that as currently constituted in section 384(b)(4) of the charter, the Mayor may dispose of city-owned property through a local development corporation (“LDC”), such as the Economic Development Corporation (“EDC”), with the approval of a majority of the members of the borough board of the borough in which such real property is located.  This may be done without any competitive bidding process and “for such purpose or purposes and at such rental or for such price as may be determined by the mayor to be in the public interest.”  The Council finds that this creates a situation where there is minimal meaningful input by the affected communities as to how city-owned properties are developed, when LDCs are spearheading the development.  Thus affected communities are ultimately left at the mercy of individuals who may or may not take their opinions and needs into consideration.  Yet these communities bear the brunt of the after-effects of the development, while the city and private developers reap the benefits of the sale or rental of a valuable piece of property.\nThis local law would grant authority to the Council to help address the long-term effects of the development of valuable city-owned property and help restore a balance to land-use decision-making.\n§ 2.  Paragraph 4 of subdivision b of section 384 of the New York city charter is hereby amended to read as follows: \n4.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this charter, or any general, special, or local law to the contrary, the mayor may, with the approval of a majority of the members of the borough board of the borough in which such real property is located, and the approval of the council, lease or sell any real property of the city, except inalienable property or any interest therein, to a local development corporation without competitive bidding and for such purpose or purposes and at such rental or for such price as may be determined by the mayor to be in the public interest, and no such lease shall run for a term longer than ninety-nine years. \n§ 3.  This local law shall become effective immediately after it shall be approved by the voters at the next general election held after its enactment.\nDJ\nLS # 11\n3/7/06",
