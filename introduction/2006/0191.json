Chapter two of title three of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new subchapter 3 to read as follows:\nSubchapter 3\nProhibition of Gifts by Lobbyists\n§3-224 Definitions. Whenever used in this subchapter, the term “public servant” shall mean a public servant as defined in subdivision nineteen of section two thousand six hundred one of the charter.\n§3-225 Prohibition of gifts. No person required to be listed on a statement of registration pursuant to section 3-213(c)(1) of subchapter 2 of this chapter shall offer or give a gift to any public servant.\n§3-226 Enforcement. Complaints alleging violations of this subchapter shall be made, received, investigated and adjudicated in a manner consistent with investigations and adjudications of conflicts of interest pursuant to chapters sixty-eight and thirty-four of the charter.\n§3-227 Penalties. Any person required to be listed on the statement of registration pursuant to section 3-213(c)(1) that knowingly and willfully violates any provision of this subchapter shall be subject to a civil penalty, which for the first offense shall be not less than two thousand five hundred dollars and not more than five thousand dollars, for the second offense not less than five thousand dollars and not more than fifteen thousand dollars, and for the third and subsequent offenses not less than fifteen thousand dollars and not more than thirty thousand dollars.  In addition to such civil penalties, for the second and subsequent offenses a person required to be listed on the statement of registration pursuant to section 3-213(c)(1) that knowingly and willfully violates the provisions of this subchapter shall also be guilty of a class A misdemeanor.\n§3-228 Rulemaking. The conflicts of interest board, in consultation with the clerk,  shall adopt such rules as necessary to ensure the implementation of this subchapter, including rules defining prohibited gifts and exceptions including de minimis gifts, such as pens and mugs, gifts that public servants may accept as gifts to the city and gifts from family members and close personal friends on family or social occasions, and to the extent practicable, such rules shall be promulgated in a manner consistent with the rules and advisory opinions of such board governing the receipt of valuable gifts by public servants.\n§2. Chapter 68 of the New York city charter is amended by adding a new section 2607 to read as follows:\n§2607. Gifts by lobbyists. Complaints made pursuant to subchapter three of chapter two of title three of the administrative code shall be made, received, investigated and adjudicated in a manner consistent with investigations and adjudications of conflicts of interest pursuant to this chapter and chapter thirty-four.\n§3. If any provision of this local law, or any amendments thereto, shall be held invalid or ineffective in whole or in part or inapplicable to any person or situation, such holding shall not affect, impair or invalidate the remainder of this local law, and all other provisions thereof shall nevertheless be separately and fully effective and the application of any such provision to other persons or situations shall not be affected.\n§4. This local law shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after it shall have become a law provided that, upon enactment of this local law, the relevant city agencies shall take all necessary steps, including but not limited to the promulgation of forms and rules, to ensure the prompt implementation of this local law upon its effective date. \nDJ\n5/23/06",
