  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\nSection 1. Declaration of legislative findings and intent. In local law number 9 for the year 2005, the Council addressed the problem of the diversion of rifles and shotguns to the illegal gun marketplace. The Council finds that the provisions of this local law must be strengthened and extended to address the problem of the proliferation of illegal handguns. \nThe illegal possession of handguns - by felons, juveniles, drug addicts, people subject to restraining orders for domestic violence, and others not legally entitled to possess handguns - is a deadly and ongoing threat to the people of New York City. The city, state, and federal government maintain extensive statutes and licensing schemes to prevent such people from acquiring handguns. Nonetheless, networks of illegal gun traffickers supply handguns to at a large profit to people who should not have them.  \nApproximately twenty percent of the city’s robberies and the majority of its murders involve guns.  The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) traced 8,437 guns used in crime in New York City from August 1997 to July 1998.  Of those guns, 278 were used in homicides and 618 were used by juveniles.  \nAlthough traffickers can obtain guns in many ways, they are often able to simply buy them from federally licensed retailers.  Rather than buy guns in their own names, illegal traffickers usually rely on “straw purchases,” i.e., having someone else purchase guns on their behalf.  One ATF study concluded that more than half of the guns identified in urban trafficking investigations that involved juveniles had been trafficked by straw purchasers or straw purchasing rings.\nATF has found that purchases of multiple handguns at the same time are a strong indicator of straw purchases and, therefore, of illegal handgun trafficking. A loophole in existing federal and New York state law allows a purchaser, once approved, to buy as many guns at a time as he or she likes. Having a straw purchaser buy more than one handgun at a time allows traffickers to work quickly, efficiently, and without involving more criminal confederates than necessary.  \nDue to the importance in illegal gun sales of multiple purchases by straw purchasers, limiting or prohibiting multiple sales by licensed dealers inhibits gun crime and illegal gun trafficking. After South Carolina and Virginia enacted one-handgun-per-month laws, their significance as suppliers of crime guns to Northeastern states diminished sharply.  In the year after Maryland passed a similar law, it experienced a fourteen percent drop in homicides.  Moreover, the number of crime guns seized in the adjacent District of Columbia that had first been bought at retail in Maryland dropped from twenty to zero. \nIn order to fight illegal handgun trafficking and therefore the supply of handguns to people who, under existing law, should not have handguns, the city must limit multiple and closely consecutive purchases of handguns. Doing so will not only save lives, but will also reinforce the city’s position as a national leader against gun crime.\n§2.\tSection 10-301 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new subdivision 20 to read as follows:\n20.\t“Acquire.” To gain possession of or title to a weapon through purchase, gift, lease, loan, or otherwise.\n§3.\tSection 10-302.1 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 9 for the year 2005, is amended to read as follows:\n§10-302.1  Preventing the diversion of firearms, rifles and shotguns to criminals. a.

Declaration of legislative findings and intent. In local law number 9 for the year 2005, the Council addressed the problem of the diversion of rifles and shotguns to the illegal gun marketplace. The Council finds that the provisions of this local law must be strengthened and extended to address the problem of the proliferation of illegal handguns. \\par\nThe illegal possession of handguns - by felons, juveniles, drug addicts, people subject to restraining orders for domestic violence, and others not legally entitled to possess handguns - is a deadly and ongoing threat to the people of New York City. The city, state, and federal government maintain extensive statutes and licensing schemes to prevent such people from acquiring handguns. Nonetheless, networks of illegal gun traffickers supply handguns to at a large profit to people who should not have them.  \\par\n\\cf1 Approximately twenty percent of the city\\rquote s robberies and the majority of its murders involve guns.  The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) traced 8,437 guns used in crime in New York City from August 1997 to July 1998.  Of those guns, 278 were used in homicides and 618 were used by juveniles.  \\par\nAlthough traffickers can obtain guns in many ways, they are often able to simply buy them from federally licensed retailers.  Rather than buy guns in their own names, illegal traffickers usually rely on \\ldblquote straw purchases,\\rdblquote  \\ul i.e.\\ulnone , having someone else purchase guns on their behalf.
