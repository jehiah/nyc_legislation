If a violation of any such restrictive covenant filed with the department would occur then the department shall not issue such permit except as permitted by order of law by a court of competent jurisdiction.  This registry shall be made available to the public during regular business hours.  The department shall promulgate any additional rules for the implementation of this subdivision.\nÂ§2.
