  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\nSection 1.  Legislative findings and intent.  In August of 2005, the New York State Legislature passed “Billy’s Law” (§483-d of the New York State social services law) to improve State and local monitoring of out-of-state residential facilities that house New York State children who are placed in such facilities for specialized services, including specialized educational services.  One such facility was the subject of an investigation by the New York State Department of Education.  The investigators’ report concluded, among other things, that the facility’s use of certain therapies raised health and safety concerns, and that students in the facility did not receive adequate academic and special education instruction.  Such findings reinforce the need to monitor allegations of abuse or neglect arising from an out-of-state residential facility placement.  It is therefore the Council’s intention to improve such monitoring in accord with the goals of Billy’s law by requiring biannual reports to the Council on the Department’s monitoring of such facilities.\n§2.  Chapter 20 of the New York city charter is hereby amended by adding a new section 530 to read as follows:\n§530.  Reporting of information concerning out-of-state facility placement.  a. Definitions.  For the purposes of this section: \n(1)  \t“Child” or “children” shall mean any city resident or residents under twenty-two years of age.\n(2)\t“Department” shall mean the New York city department of education.\n(3)\t“Individual” shall mean any resident under twenty-two years of age.\n(4)\t“Out-of-state facility” shall mean any facility outside of New York state in which the department, pursuant to section 4407 of the New York state education law, places a child for the purposes of  providing instruction to such child.\nb.

Legislative findings and intent.  In August of 2005, the New York State Legislature passed \\ldblquote Billy\\rquote s Law\\rdblquote  (\\'a7483-d of the New York State social services law) to improve State and local monitoring of out-of-state residential facilities that house New York State children who are placed in such facilities for specialized services, including specialized educational services.  One such facility was the subject of an investigation by the New York State Department of Education.  The investigators\\rquote  report concluded, among other things, that the facility\\rquote s use of certain therapies raised health and safety concerns, and that students in the facility did not receive adequate academic and special education instruction.  Such findings reinforce the need to monitor allegations of abuse or neglect arising from an out-of-state residential facility placement.  It is therefore the Council\\rquote s intention to improve such monitoring in accord with the goals of Billy\\rquote s law by requiring biannual reports to the Council on the Department\\rquote s monitoring of such facilities.\\par\n\\'a72.  Chapter 20 of the New York city charter is hereby amended by adding a new section 530 to read as follows:\\par\n\\ul\\'a7530.  Reporting of information concerning out-of-state facility placement.  a.
