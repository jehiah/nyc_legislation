The Council of the City of New York hereby finds that the Environmental Control Board (“ECB”) requires modifications to its structure and hearing processes in order to provide greater fairness and more timely and effective decisions for City residents and business owners appearing before it.  The Council, through its oversight functions and through receipt of numerous reports from persons who have appeared before the Environmental Control Board, has discerned alarming practices relating to ECB adjudications that raise serious questions as to whether respondents are treated fairly and accorded due process, and also raises concerns that outcomes at the ECB are not always based upon the merits of the matters adjudicated.  The Council seeks to address these shortcomings in an effort to provide a more fair administrative adjudicatory process that will engender greater confidence in and respect for the ECB’s determinations and that will also serve to help foster an environment for business, especially small businesses to thrive in New York City.  \n§2.

Declaration of legislative findings and intent.  The Council of the City of New York hereby finds that the Environmental Control Board (\\ldblquote ECB\\rdblquote ) requires modifications to its structure and hearing processes in order to provide greater fairness and more timely and effective decisions for City residents and business owners appearing before it.  The Council, through its oversight functions and through receipt of numerous reports from persons who have appeared before the Environmental Control Board, has discerned alarming practices relating to ECB adjudications that raise serious questions as to whether respondents are treated fairly and accorded due process, and also raises concerns that outcomes at the ECB are not always based upon the merits of the matters adjudicated.  The Council seeks to address these shortcomings in an effort to provide a more fair administrative adjudicatory process that will engender greater confidence in and respect for the ECB\\rquote s determinations and that will also serve to help foster an environment for business, especially small businesses to thrive in New York City.  \\par\n\\pard\\fi720\\sl480\\slmult1\\qj\\'a72.
