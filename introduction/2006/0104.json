  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\nSection 1. Declaration of legislative findings and intent.  The Council finds that electronic waste represents one of the fastest growing and most hazardous components of the City of New York’s waste stream.   It is estimated that, based upon national data, less than 10% of the city’s electronic waste is currently being recycled.   According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), more than 2.6 million tons of computers, television sets and other electronic waste were discarded in the United States during 2005. The EPA also estimates that there are hundreds of millions of pieces of electronic waste being stockpiled in homes and businesses.\nElectronic waste contains many toxic substances, that include known or probable human carcinogens that have been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), European Union and other municipal and state Departments of Health throughout the country.  An average television set with a traditional cathode ray tube contains as much as five to seven pounds of lead, and an average computer terminal contains four pounds of lead as well as smaller amounts of mercury and cadmium.  The improper disposal of this waste therefore poses a threat to human health and the environment.  Indeed, according to the EPA, as much as 70% of heavy metals contained in landfills, including lead, mercury and cadmium, originates from electronic waste.  The incineration of electronic waste can lead to increased mercury, lead and other toxic airborne emissions. \nThere are direct environmental and public health consequences for New York City residents and workers from the improper handling and disposal of electronic waste.  For example, the regional incineration of electronic waste poses a direct threat to the city’s air quality and the health of its residents.\nThe Council finds that there is currently no comprehensive system for managing the growing problem of electronic waste in the city of New York.  The Council further finds that the establishment of a system to provide for the collection, handling and recycling or reuse of electronic equipment in this city is consistent with its duty to protect the health, safety and welfare of its citizens; enhance and maintain the quality of the environment; and help prevent air, water and land pollution. The Council further finds that such a system is consistent with New York State’s overall solid waste management policy, including its intent to pursue and implement an integrated approach to solid waste management and to aggressively promote waste reduction, reuse and recycling as the preferred methods of waste management.\n\tThe purpose of this chapter is to establish a comprehensive electronics recycling system that ensures the safe and environmentally sound handling, recycling, reuse of electronic equipment.  In addition, it is the purpose of this chapter to establish an electronics recycling and reuse collection system that is convenient and minimizes costs to consumers of electronic equipment and to the City.  The Council further finds that by encouraging convenient and environmentally sound collection of electronic waste, this chapter would reduce the environmental and health costs associated with electronic equipment that is discarded along with ordinary waste. The Council finds that the setting of performance standards is necessary to insure that electronic equipment is collected and recycled in appropriate amounts. The three-year period before penalties are imposed for failure to meet the prescribed performance standards gives the industry and the city ample time and data to evaluate, and if necessary, adjust the prescribed performance standards.\nThe Council finds that the manufacturers of electronic equipment should reduce and, to the maximum extent feasible, ultimately phase out the use of hazardous materials in electronic products. The Council further finds that primary responsibility for the collection, handling and recycling or reuse of electronic equipment belongs to manufacturers.  Currently, manufacturers of electronic equipment are required to bear none of the financial burden or responsibility for safely managing discarded electronic equipment at the end of its useful life, burdening local governments and end users with these costs and responsibilities. Manufacturers of electronic equipment, in working to achieve the goals and objectives of this chapter, should have the flexibility to act in partnership with each other, the city and businesses that provide collection and handling services to develop, implement and promote a safe and effective electronics recycling system. \n\t§2.

The commissioner may approve such proposed schedule or may approve a modification to such proposed schedule that provides for a reasonable compliance time beyond that provided for in such section.    \n§16-424 Performance  Standards a. A manufacturer shall demonstrate whether, pursuant to its electronic waste management plan, it is collecting for recycling or reuse at least its share of covered electronic equipment.  Such manufacturer’s share of covered electronic equipment is determined by applying the following minimum collection standard percentage by the average annual sales of the manufacturer’s covered electronic equipment in the city, reported by weight, during the previous three calendar years; by July 1, 2012, the minimum collection standard is twenty-five percent; by July 1, 2015, the minimum collection standard is forty-five percent; by July 1, 2018, the minimum collection standard is sixty-five percent.\n\tb. For purposes of calculating achievement of the minimum collection standard specified in paragraph a of this subdivision, a manufacturer may count the collection of a single item of covered electronic equipment as twice its weight when that item is donated free of charge for reuse to the New York city department of education, or to any not-for-profit corporation, as defined in subparagraphs five or seven of subdivision a of section one hundred two of the New York not-for-profit corporation law, a principal mission of which is to assist low-income children or families living in city.  To qualify for the donation reuse credit under this subdivision, the covered electronic equipment must be: (a) no older than three years old, (b) in full working condition, and (c) accepted as a donation by the recipient in writing.\nc.  The commissioner may grant an annual waiver, in whole or in part, from the minimum collection standards set forth in subdivision a of this section where a manufacturer who has an approved electronic waste management plan has demonstrated to the commissioner’s satisfaction that such minimum collection standards could not be met despite the best efforts of the manufacturer because the manufacturer has substantially increased the amount of covered electronic equipment sold within the city over the three-year period during which compliance with subdivision a of this section is to be measured and it was not practicable to meet the applicable  minimum collection standard. \n§16-425 Labeling. a. Beginning July first, two thousand nine or one hundred eighty days after a manufacturer’s electronic waste management plan is approved by the department, whichever date is later, such manufacturer may not sell or otherwise distribute for sale in the city covered electronic equipment unless such equipment has a label that identifies such manufacturer.  \nb. Beginning July first, two thousand nine or one hundred eighty days after a manufacturer’s electronic waste management plan is approved by the department, whichever date is later, such manufacturer shall provide at the point of sale information on how a person can return covered electronic equipment pursuant to such manufacturer’s electronic waste management plan. Such information shall include a toll-free telephone number or internet website address describing how covered electronic equipment can be returned pursuant to the manufacturer’s electronic waste management plan. \nc. Beginning July first, two thousand nine, the department shall post on its web site all information provided to it from manufacturers describing how covered electronic equipment can be returned pursuant to a specific manufacture’s electronic waste management plan.\n        \t§ 16-426 Disposal ban.  a. Beginning July first, two thousand ten, no person shall dispose of covered electronic equipment as solid waste in the city. \nb.  Beginning July first, two thousand nine, no manufacturer shall dispose of covered electronic equipment as solid waste in the city.   \n§16-427 Enforcement.  a.

The EPA also estimates that there are hundreds of millions of pieces of electronic waste being stockpiled in homes and businesses.\\par\nElectronic waste contains many toxic substances, that include known or probable human carcinogens that have been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\\ldblquote EPA\\rdblquote ), European Union and other municipal and state Departments of Health throughout the country\\f1\\fs20 .\\f0\\fs24   An average television set with a traditional cathode ray tube contains as much as five to seven pounds of lead, and an average computer terminal contains four pounds of lead as well as smaller amounts of mercury and cadmium.  The improper disposal of this waste therefore poses a threat to human health and the environment.  Indeed, according to the EPA, as much as 70% of heavy metals contained in landfills, including lead, mercury and cadmium, originates from electronic waste.  The incineration of electronic waste can lead to increased mercury, lead and other toxic airborne emissions. \\par\nThere are direct environmental and public health consequences for New York City residents and workers from the improper handling and disposal of electronic waste.  For example, the regional incineration of electronic waste poses a direct threat to the city\\rquote s air quality and the health of its residents.\\par\nThe Council finds that there is currently no comprehensive system for managing the growing problem of electronic waste in the city of New York.  The Council further finds that the establishment of a system to provide for the collection, handling and recycling or reuse of electronic equipment in this city is consistent with its duty to protect the health, safety and welfare of its citizens; enhance and maintain the quality of the environment; and help prevent air, water and land pollution. The Council further finds that such a system is consistent with New York State\\rquote s overall solid waste management policy, including its intent to pursue and implement an integrated approach to solid waste management and to aggressively promote waste reduction, reuse and recycling as the preferred methods of waste management.\\par\n\\pard\\nowidctlpar\\fi360\\sb120\\sl480\\slmult1\\qj\\tab The purpose of this chapter is to establish a comprehensive electronics recycling system that ensures the safe and environmentally sound handling, recycling, reuse of electronic equipment.  In addition, it is the purpose of this chapter to establish an electronics recycling and reuse collection system that is convenient and minimizes costs to consumers of electronic equipment and to the City.  The Council further finds that by encouraging convenient and environmentally sound collection of electronic waste, this chapter would reduce the environmental and health costs associated with electronic equipment that is discarded along with ordinary waste. The Council finds that the setting of performance standards is necessary to insure that electronic equipment is collected and recycled in appropriate amounts. The three-year period before penalties are imposed for failure to meet the prescribed performance standards gives the industry and the city ample time and data to evaluate, and if necessary, adjust the prescribed performance standards.\\par\n\\pard\\nowidctlpar\\fi720\\sl480\\slmult1\\qj The Council finds that the manufacturers of electronic equipment should reduce and, to the maximum extent feasible, ultimately phase out the use of hazardous materials in electronic products. The Council further finds that primary responsibility for the collection, handling and recycling or reuse of electronic equipment belongs to manufacturers.  Currently, manufacturers of electronic equipment are required to bear none of the financial burden or responsibility for safely managing discarded electronic equipment at the end of its useful life, burdening local governments and end users with these costs and responsibilities. Manufacturers of electronic equipment, in working to achieve the goals and objectives of this chapter, should have the flexibility to act in partnership with each other, the city and businesses that provide collection and handling services to develop, implement and promote a safe and effective electronics recycling system. \\par\n\\pard\\nowidctlpar\\sl480\\slmult1\\tab\\'a72.
