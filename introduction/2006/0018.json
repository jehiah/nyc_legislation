  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\nSection 1.  Chapter two of title four of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding thereto a new section 4-207 to read as follows:\n\t§4-207 Assessment of certain clean on-site power generation technologies.  a. By January 1, 2008, the department of citywide administrative services shall conduct an assessment of all facilities owned by the city with a five hundred kilowatt or greater peak demand to determine whether cogeneration and natural gas-based distributed generation projects are appropriate for such facilities.  For purposes of this section, “cogeneration and natural gas-based distributed generation projects” shall only include those projects where such electric generation would be connected to the distribution level of the grid, would be located at or near the intended place of use and would produce fewer emissions of carbon dioxide and particulate matter per unit of useful energy output than a new combined-cycle natural-gas fired central power plant.  Such assessment shall include, but not be limited to, the technical, physical and/or economic feasibility of installing such electric generation.\n\tb. The assessment required to be completed pursuant to subdivision a of this section shall be reviewed by the department of citywide administrative services at a minimum of every five years and shall be updated, as appropriate, to reflect newly acquired facilities and changes in existing facilities that may alter the conclusions made in such assessment, as it may have been revised, as well as developments in the electric generation technologies specified in subdivision a of this section that affect the emissions of carbon dioxide or particulate matter resulting from the use of such technologies or affect prior technical, physical or economic feasibility assessments, including the availability of funding or financing sources.\t\n\tc. A report on the assessment and updates required to be completed pursuant to subdivisions a and b of this section shall be submitted to the mayor and the speaker of the council within ten days of the completion of such assessment and updates, and shall include, but not be limited to, an explanation of the process, criteria and specific analyses used for such assessments and updates and the results of such assessments and updates for each facility.\n\t§2.
