  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection 1.  Declaration of legislative findings and intent.  According to the Administration for Children’s Services (ACS), approximately 1,200 youth aged 18 and older transition out of New York City’s foster care system each year.  ACS further reports that only about 20 percent of these young adults leave to be adopted or reunified with their families, and the remaining 80 percent must primarily rely on themselves.  Numerous studies demonstrate that youth who age out of foster care tend to experience worse outcomes than their peers in a variety of critical areas such as education, employment, income security, housing, and criminal justice involvement.  There has not been a comprehensive analysis of outcomes for foster youth in New York City to date.  While ACS has begun collecting data about this population, these efforts are still in their nascent stages and there is no current mechanism for regular, public dissemination of this information.  Such data would assist the Council in evaluating how successful ACS is in fulfilling its mandate to adequately prepare youth who age out of foster care for stable and independent living, and in evaluating the need for policy changes.\n\t§2.  Chapter 9 of title 21 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 21-902.1 to read as follows:\n§21-902.1.  1.  Definitions.
