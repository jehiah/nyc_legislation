  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection 1. Subdivision 7 of section 11-2501 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\n7. \"Rent.\" The consideration received for occupancy valued in money, whether received in money or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits, and property or services of any kind or nature, including any service and/or booking fees that are a condition of occupancy, and also any amount for which credit is allowed by the operator or room remarketer to the occupant, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever.\n§2.\tSection 11-2501 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding three new subdivisions 12, 13 and 14 to read as follows: \n12.\t“Room remarketer.”\tAny person, excluding the operator, having any right, access, ability or authority, through an internet transaction or any other means whatsoever, to offer, reserve, book, arrange for, remarket, distribute, broker, resell, or facilitate the transfer of rooms the occupancy of which is subject to tax under this chapter. \n13.\t“Net rent.” The rent received by an operator from a room remarketer.\n14.\t“Additional rent.” The excess of the rent received from an occupant by a room remarketer over the net rent. \n§3.\tSection 11-2502 of the administrative code of the city of New York, paragraph 3 of subdivision a as amended by local law number 65 for the year 2008, paragraph 4 of subdivision a as separately amended by chapters 29 and 69 of the laws of 1986, subdivision b as amended by local law number 43 for the year 1990, subdivision c as added by chapter 454 of the laws of 1998, subdivision d as added by local law number 73 for the year 2001, and subdivision j as amended by chapter 454 of the laws of 1998, is amended to read as follows:\n§11-2502 Imposition of tax.\na. (1) On and after July first, nineteen hundred seventy until and including August thirty-first, nineteen hundred eighty, there is hereby imposed and there shall be paid a tax for every occupancy of each room in a hotel in the city of New York at the rates set forth in, and determined in accordance with the following table:\n If the rent per day for the room is:          \tThe tax is:\n Less than $10                      \t\t\t$.25 per day\n $10 or more, but less than $15            \t.50 per day\n $15 or more, but less than $20            \t.75 per day\n $20 or more                      \t\t\t1.00 per day\n (2) On and after September first, nineteen hundred eighty, there is hereby imposed and there shall be paid a tax for every occupancy of each room in a hotel in the city of New York at the rates set forth in, and determined in accordance with, the following table:\n  If the rent per day for the room is:          \tThe tax is:\n $10 or more, but less than $20             \t$.50 per day\n $20 or more, but less than $30             \t$1.00 per day\n $30 or more, but less than $40             \t$1.50 per day\n $40 or more                      \t \t\t$2.00 per day\n  Where a person occupies a room for less than a full day and pays less than the rent for a full day, the tax shall nevertheless be the same amount as would be due had such person occupied the room for a full day at the rent for a full day.\n (3)  In addition to the tax imposed by paragraph two of this subdivision, there is hereby imposed and there shall be paid a tax for every occupancy of each room in a hotel in the city of New York (A) at the rate of five percent of the rent or charge per day for each such room up to and including August thirty-first, nineteen hundred ninety, (B) at the rate of six percent of the rent or charge per day for each such room on and after September first, nineteen hundred ninety and before December first, nineteen hundred ninety-four, (C) at the rate of five percent of the rent or charge per day for each such room on and after December first, nineteen hundred ninety-four and before March first, two thousand nine, (D) at the rate of five and seven-eighths percent of the rent or charge per day for each such room on and after March first, two thousand nine and before December first, two thousand eleven, and (E) at the rate of five percent of the rent or charge per day for each such room on and after December first, two thousand eleven. \n(4) Where the occupancy of a room is reserved, booked or otherwise arranged for by a room remarketer, the tax imposed by paragraph three of this subdivision shall be determined based on the rent received from the occupant by the room remarketer. In such a transaction, the room remarketer shall collect from the occupant and remit to the operator that portion of the tax that is determined based upon the net rent, and the operator shall pay such portion of the tax to the commissioner of finance. The room remarketer shall collect from the occupant and pay to the commissioner of finance that portion of the tax that is determined based upon the additional rent. \n(5)\tWhere the rent is paid or charged or billed, or falls due on either a weekly, monthly or other term basis, the daily rent upon which the tax is determined shall be the result obtained by dividing the rent for such term by the number of days in such term. Where the rent is for more than one room, including but not limited to a suite of rooms, the daily rent per room upon which tax is determined shall be calculated by multiplying the daily rent for the group of rooms by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the daily rent for the particular room, or a similar room, when such room is rented alone with similar bath facilities, and the denominator of which shall be the total of the daily rent for the individual rooms in the group of rooms, or similar rooms, when such rooms are rented alone with similar bath facilities. In any case in which it is not possible to determine the daily rent per room in the foregoing manner, the commissioner of finance shall prescribe methods for making such determination. \nb.
