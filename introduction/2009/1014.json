  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\tSection 1.  Statement of legislative findings and intent.  Under Section 957(d)(i) of the General Municipal Law, certain business enterprises located outside the boundaries of an Empire Zone may still be eligible for Empire Zone benefits as a “regionally significant project” because the economic activity of such enterprise is of a nature that is encouraged by the State, and the Administrative Board of such Empire Zone recommends the designation of such business as a regionally significant project.  The New York State Department of Economic Development has determined that Epic Pharma LLC, a minority-owned pharmaceutical manufacturer is projected to create 50 new jobs and has been provisionally approved for Empire Zones benefits as a regionally significant project under Section 957(d)(i) of the General Municipal Law.  \n§2. Chapter 7 of title 22 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding new section 22-720 to read as follows:\n§22-720  Authorization for the designation of a regionally significant project - Epic Pharma LLC.  a. Pursuant to the provisions of article 18-B of the general municipal law, a business enterprise may be designated as a regionally significant project if the criteria set forth in paragraph i of subdivision d of section 957 of such article are met.\n b. By a resolution of the South Jamaica empire zone administrative board, dated December 9, 2008, such administrative board, in accordance with the provisions of article 18-B of the general municipal law, supported the designation of Epic Pharma LLC, having federal employer identification number 32-0254130 and located at 227-15 North Conduit Avenue, in the borough of Queens, as a regionally significant project. \nc. Pursuant to the provisions of article 18-B of the general municipal law, such regionally significant project shall be as set forth as follows: \nEpic Pharma LLC, having federal employer identification number 32-0254130 and located at 227-15 North Conduit Avenue, also known as Block: 13193 Lot: 170, in the borough of Queens.\n§3.  This local law shall take effect immediately and the commissioner of small business services shall immediately take such actions as are necessary for the administration and implementation of this local law.\n\n\nH:/Proposed Int. No. 1014-A\nEpic Pharma\n10-22-09",
