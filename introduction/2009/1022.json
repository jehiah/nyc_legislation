The Panel shall be comprised of the Director of the Mayor’s Office of Operations; the Director of the Mayor’s Office of Management and Budget; the Corporation Counsel; the Director of the Mayor’s Office of Special Enforcement; the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer Affairs; the Commissioner of the Department of Small Business Services; and three Council Members designated by the Speaker of the City Council.  The Mayor shall appoint one additional member to serve as chair of the panel.  Each member of the Panel may designate one or more staff members to represent that member on the Panel. \n§  2. Powers and Responsibilities of the Panel. a. The Panel shall study and evaluate the extent to which agency rules are currently successful in meeting regulatory objectives in a way that minimizes the costs and burdens borne by City agencies, local businesses, consumers, homeowners, and the public. \nIn order to identify those agency rules that should be given primary focus, the Panel shall work with City agencies, including those agencies that impact small businesses, and receive input from them, as well as from other branches of government, from members of the public, and from private and not-for-profit entities, such as small businesses, established and emerging industries, trade associations, community organizations, labor unions, and good government groups.  \nb. The Panel shall, where appropriate, develop recommendations to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the City’s regulatory system, including those to amend or modify Chapter 45 of the City Charter, known as the City Administrative Procedure Act.\n When making such recommendations, the Panel shall consider and explore the following issues: public benefit; fiscal impact; customer service impact; and alternative legal or administrative mechanisms, such as the use of technology or more strategic inter-agency coordination.  \nc. The Panel may establish an advisory group or groups comprised of experts from within, and outside of, City government to provide appropriate subject matter guidance. \nd. The Panel shall report its initial findings and recommendations to the Speaker of the City Council and the Mayor no later than December 31, 2009. \n§ 3. Agency Assistance and Cooperation with the Panel.  All City agencies shall designate a liaison to work with the Panel and provide it with appropriate information and other assistance, as may be requested, in a timely manner. \n§ 4.
