The permit holder shall perform a final acceptance test of the completed system in accordance with the requirements of Section 901.5 of this code.  \n1704.22.1.2 Enlargements or additions to existing system.  Where there is an enlargement that triggers a new standpipe system or there is an addition to an existing standpipe system, hydrostatic pressure tests of the entire system shall be performed for every 75 feet (22 860 mm) of additional height added to the system.  The permit holder shall perform a final acceptance test of the completed system in accordance with the requirements of Section 901.5 of this code.  \n1704.22.1.3 Removal of stories, including full demolitions.  Where stories are removed from a building served by an existing standpipe system, hydrostatic pressure tests of the entire system shall be performed prior to the commencement of work.\n1704.22.1.4 Alterations.  For alterations not covered under Sections 1704.22.1.2 or 1704.22.1.3 above, the permit holder shall perform a final acceptance test of the completed system in accordance with the requirements of Section 901.5 of this code.  \n1704.22.1.5 Readiness. No standpipe system shall be considered in readiness until there has been a successful hydrostatic pressure test.\n§3  Within 120 days of enactment, the department of buildings shall promulgate rules pursuant to section 28-103.19 of the administrative code amending NPFA 14 and establishing the minimum standards for hydrostatic pressure tests of standpipe systems under sections 1704.22.1.1 and 1704.22.1.2 of this code at not less than 20.7 bar (300 psi) of pressure for one hour.\n§4.
