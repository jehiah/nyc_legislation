Title 15 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 15-111.2 to read as follows:\n§15-111.2  Firefighter, high school credit.  In addition to any other relevant employment qualifications established pursuant to any law, rule, or regulation, any candidate for firefighter who possesses a high school diploma or a General Educational Development or GED credential from a school or testing center located within the city of New York, whether such school or testing center is public or private, shall be eligible for additional credits that equate to eight percent of the total possible points of the open competitive firefighter examination, following the successful completion of such examination; provided, however, that any candidate who possesses a GED credential must have attended high school, whether public or private, at some point within the city of New York prior to obtaining such GED credential in order to be eligible for such additional credits.  Such credits shall be in addition to any other credits or preferences for which a candidate may already be eligible.\n§2. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or other portion of this local law is for any reason declared unconstitutional or invalid, in whole or in part, by any court of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed severable, and such unconstitutionality or invalidity shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this local law, which remaining portions shall continue in full force and effect.\n§3.
