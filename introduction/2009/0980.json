  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\tSection 1.  Legislative findings and intent.  Persons cannot park motor vehicles in areas controlled by muni-meters without first purchasing the amount of parking time desired from the meter, and displaying a payment receipt in the vehicle windshield if such requirement is indicated.  The council finds that persons parking motorcycles have little to no means of securing such payment receipt on the vehicle for display.  Thus, payment receipts for motorcycles are often lost, damaged or stolen.  This bill would address this problem by    requiring the Department of Transportation to create a plan to address motorcycle parking in areas controlled by muni-meters.  \n\t§2.  Subchapter two of chapter one of title nineteen of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 19-175.2 to read as follows:\n\t§ 19-175.2 Plan for street parking of motorcycles in areas controlled by municipal meters. a. Definitions.  For the purposes of this section, the following terms shall be defined as follows:\n\t1.  “Motorcycle” shall have the same meaning as defined in section 123 of the New York state vehicle and traffic law.\n\t2.  “Muni-meter” shall have the same meaning as defined in section 19-167.1 of the code. \n\tb.  No later than one hundred twenty days after the effective date of the local law that added this section, the department shall create and implement a plan to address motorcycle parking in areas controlled by muni-meters.  Such plan shall include, but not be limited to, providing a solution for securing muni-meter receipts on motorcycles parked at such meters.  \n\t§3.
