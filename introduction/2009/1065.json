Section 11-604 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new subdivision 21 to read as follows: \n21.   Biotechnology Credit.  (a) (1) A taxpayer that is a qualified emerging technology company, engages in biotechnologies, and meets  the  eligibility  requirements   of this subdivision, shall be allowed a credit against the tax  imposed by this subchapter.  The amount of credit shall be equal to the sum of the amounts specified in subparagraphs (3), (4), and (5) of this paragraph, subject  to  the  limitations  in  subparagraph (7) of  this paragraph and paragraph (b) of this subdivision.  For the purposes of this subdivision, “qualified  emerging  technology  company”  shall  mean a company located in city: (A) whose primary products  or  services  are classified as emerging technologies and whose total annual product sales are ten million dollars or less; or (B) a company that has research and development activities in city and whose ratio of research and development  funds  to net sales equals or exceeds the average ratio for all surveyed companies classified as determined by the National  Science Foundation  in  the  most  recent  published  results from its Survey of Industry Research and Development, or any comparable successor survey as determined by the department, and whose total annual product  sales  are ten million dollars or less. For the purposes of this subdivision, the definition of research and development funds shall be the same as that used by the National Science Foundation  in  the  aforementioned survey.   For the purposes of this subdivision, “biotechnologies” shall mean  the technologies  involving the  scientific  manipulation  of  living  organisms,  especially at the molecular and/or the sub-molecular genetic level,  to  produce  products conducive  to  improving  the  lives  and health of plants, animals, and humans;  and  the  associated  scientific   research,   pharmacological, mechanical,  and  computational applications and services connected with these improvements.  Activities  included  with  such  applications  and services  shall  include,  but  not  be  limited  to,  alternative  mRNA splicing,   DNA   sequence   amplification,  antigenetic switching bioaugmentation,   bioenrichment,  bioremediation,  chromosome  walking, cytogenetic engineering, DNA diagnosis, fingerprinting, and  sequencing, electroporation,  gene  translocation,  genetic  mapping,  site-directed mutagenesis,   bio-transduction,   bio-mechanical   and   bio-electrical engineering, and bio-informatics.\n\t(2)  An  eligible  taxpayer  shall  (A)  have no more than one hundred full-time employees, of which at least seventy-five percent are employed in the city,  (B) have a ratio of research and  development  funds to  net sales, as referred to in section thirty-one hundred two-e of the public authorities law, which equals or exceeds six percent during  the calendar year ending with or within the taxable  year for which the credit is claimed,  and  (C)  have  gross  revenues,  along with the gross revenues of its “affiliates” and “related  members” not  exceeding  twenty million  dollars for the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year ending with or within the taxable year for which the credit is claimed.  For the purposes of this subdivision, “affiliates” shall mean those corporations that are members of the same affiliated group (as defined in section fifteen hundred four of the internal revenue code) as the taxpayer.
