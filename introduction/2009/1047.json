Section 18-107 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows: \n\t§ 18-107  Replacement  of  trees  removed  [during  construction].  Any individual,  firm  [or]  corporation or city agency  that  intends   to   remove   [during  construction]   any   tree   that  is  within  the  jurisdiction  of  the commissioner, shall obtain a permit from the department.  Prior to obtaining such permit, such individual, firm, corporation or city agency shall post a bond with the  commissioner  to  insure  that within  thirty  days  [after  the  completion  of  construction] following such removal all trees removed, destroyed or severely damaged shall be replaced at the  expense of  the permittee. The total caliper of all trees planted in the course of restoration shall in no event be less than the total caliper of all trees removed, destroyed or severely damaged, with the maximum caliper of such replacement trees to be determined by the commissioner by rule, and the number of trees replaced shall be equal to or greater than the number of trees removed, destroyed, or severely damaged.  Replacement shall be made [with 2 1/2 to 6 inch caliper trees and/or] as directed by the department horticultural officer[.], consistent with this section.    The replacement shall be made in the spring or fall season, as determined by such horticultural officer. The amount of the bond as determined by the commissioner shall be sufficient to cover the cost of replacement. The provisions of this section requiring posting a bond and obtaining a permit shall not apply to the department, but the department shall comply with all other requirements of this section and any rules promulgated pursuant to this section.\n\n§2. This law shall take effect ninety days following enactment, except that the commissioner shall take such actions as are necessary for its implementation, including the promulgation of rules, prior to such effective date.\nLF \nLS #6954\n7/22/09",
