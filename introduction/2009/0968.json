The department shall provide each such school with a copy of such report and shall post a copy of such report on its website. \n§2. If any subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or other portion of this local law is, for any reason, declared unconstitutional or invalid, in whole or in part, by any court of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed severable and such unconstitutionality or invalidity shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of the local law that added this section, which remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect.  Nothing in this local law shall be interpreted or applied so as to create any power, duty or obligation in conflict with any federal or state law.\n§3. This local law shall take effect ninety days after its enactment into law and shall be deemed repealed on December 31, 2011; provided, however, that the commissioner of the department shall take such actions, including the promulgation of rules, as may be necessary for timely implementation of this local law.  \n\n\nAS/AT\nLS# 49\n3/5/09",
