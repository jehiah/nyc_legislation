  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection 1.  Legislative Findings.  \n\tThe country is currently in the midst of a foreclosure crisis, with thousands of homes being foreclosed upon monthly.  Foreclosures in New York City increased steadily throughout 2008, with the highest rates of foreclosure in the Bronx, Queens and Staten Island.  Increasing rates of foreclosures and defaults on home loans created an industry of  distressed property consultants, or individuals who market themselves as uniquely able to help homeowners negotiate with their lenders.  The Council finds that unfortunately, homeowners already in precarious situations find themselves in even worse positions as unscrupulous consultants take their money and do nothing on their behalf.  In an effort to combat the perceived wide-spread fraud in this industry, New York State enacted a law in August 2008 that prohibited distressed property consultants from collecting any funds prior to rendering services or taking power of attorney from a homeowner and mandated the parties enter into a fully executed, written contract prior to rendering services.  Additionally, consultants are required to notify potential clients that they should consider consulting an independent attorney or government-approved housing counselor prior to signing any documents pertaining to their home and must provide the homeowner with information about how to locate a government-approved housing counselor.  \n\tThe Council finds that while the state law seeks to prevent fraud by unscrupulous distressed property consultants, distressed property consultants continue to solicit business in communities with high foreclosure rates throughout the City.   Many local non-profits offer foreclosure prevention or loan modification services for free, but as long as for-profit distressed property consultants exist, it behooves City residents to be aware of the legal constraints placed on consultants under state law.  Therefore, the Council finds it necessary to mandate disclosure requirements in advertisements placed by distressed property consultants.  These disclosures will ensure New York City residents are aware of their rights when paying for distressed property consulting services.    \n§2.  Subchapter 5 of Chapter 5 of title 20 of the administrative code of the City of New York is amended by adding a new section 20-723.3 to read as follows:\n§ 20-723.3 Disclosure Requirements for Distressed Property Consultants.  a. Definitions.  For the purposes of this section the following terms shall have the following meanings:\n\t1. “Consulting services” means services promised by a distressed property consultant to a homeowner, including but not limited to services that the consultant represents will help to achieve any of the following:\n\ti.  An action to stop, enjoin, delay, set aside, annul, stay or postpone a foreclosure filing, a foreclosure sale or the loss of a home for nonpayment of taxes; \n\tii.

The exercise of a right of reinstatement or similar right by the homeowner as  provided in the mortgage documents or any law or the refinancing of a distressed home loan; \n\tiv.  Any extension of the period within which the homeowner may reinstate or otherwise restore his or her rights with respect to the property; \n\tv.  A waiver of an acceleration clause contained in any promissory note or contract secured by a mortgage on a property in foreclosure; \n\tvi.  A loan or advance of funds; \n\tvii.

For purposes of this paragraph, a “home loan’ is a loan in which the debt is incurred by the homeowner, or shareholder in a cooperative corporation, primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, and the loan is secured by a mortgage or deed of trust on property, or in the case of a cooperative by a security agreement in shares in a corporation, upon which there is located or there is to be located a structure or structures intended principally for occupancy of from one to four families, which is or will be occupied by the homeowner as the homeowner’s principal dwelling.\n\t3. “Distressed property consultant” means an individual or corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other business entity that, directly or indirectly, solicits or undertakes employment to provide consulting services to a homeowner for compensation or promise of compensation with respect to a distressed home loan or a potential loss of the home for nonpayment of taxes, or any individual or business entity considered a distressed property consultant for purposes of New York state real property law section 265-b.

Legislative Findings.  \\par\n\\tab The country is currently in the midst of a foreclosure crisis, with thousands of homes being foreclosed upon monthly.  Foreclosures in New York City increased steadily throughout 2008, with the highest rates of foreclosure in the Bronx, Queens and Staten Island.  Increasing rates of foreclosures and defaults on home loans created an industry of  distressed property consultants, or individuals who market themselves as uniquely able to help homeowners negotiate with their lenders.  The Council finds that unfortunately, homeowners already in precarious situations find themselves in even worse positions as unscrupulous consultants take their money and do nothing on their behalf.  In an effort to combat the perceived wide-spread fraud in this industry, New York State enacted a law in August 2008 that prohibited distressed property consultants from collecting any funds prior to rendering services or taking power of attorney from a homeowner and mandated the parties enter into a fully executed, written contract prior to rendering services.  Additionally, consultants are required to notify potential clients that they should consider consulting an independent attorney or government-approved housing counselor prior to signing any documents pertaining to their home and must provide the homeowner with information about how to locate a government-approved housing counselor.  \\par\n\\tab The Council finds that while the state law seeks to prevent fraud by unscrupulous distressed property consultants, distressed property consultants continue to solicit business in communities with high foreclosure rates throughout the City.   Many local non-profits offer foreclosure prevention or loan modification services for free, but as long as for-profit distressed property consultants exist, it behooves City residents to be aware of the legal constraints placed on consultants under state law.  Therefore, the Council finds it necessary to mandate disclosure requirements in advertisements placed by distressed property consultants.  These disclosures will ensure New York City residents are aware of their rights when paying for distressed property consulting services.    \\par\n\\pard\\ltrpar\\nowidctlpar\\fi720\\sl480\\slmult1\\qj\\'a72.
