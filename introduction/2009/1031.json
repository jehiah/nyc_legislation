The commissioner shall not issue registration plates to more than thirty pedicabs for any pedicab business.  No pedicab business or pedicab owner shall hold more than thirty registration plates at any one time.

It shall be unlawful for a pedicab business to operate or authorize the operation of, or for a pedicab driver to operate, a pedicab unless:\n1.  it has been inspected by the department;\n2.  it has been issued a registration plate that indicates on such plate[, or by a  \nreplaceable registration tag or decal,] the expiration date of the current registration; and\n3.   such registration is in effect.\n§6.  Subdivisions b, c, e, and f of section 20-255 the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 19 for the year 2007, are amended, subdivision g of such section is relettered as subdivision f and as so relettered is amended, and a new subdivision g is added to such section, to read as follows:  \nb.

A pedicab business shall pay an additional fifty-five dollars as the re-inspection fee for any pedicab that fails to appear at an inspection scheduled by the department or that is determined upon inspection not to meet the requirements of this section and such business re-applies for a registration plate [or replaceable registration tag or decal]. The commissioner shall also have the authority to determine the circumstances under which reinspections of pedicabs shall be permitted.\ng.  It shall be unlawful for a person to whom a registration plate has been issued to transfer any interest in such plate to any other person unless:\n1.  the pedicab, if intended to be transferred with the registration plate, complies with all applicable requirements imposed by this subchapter;\n2.  such transfer will not result in a violation of subdivision d of section 20-251; and \n3.  the commissioner approves such transfer.  \n§7.
