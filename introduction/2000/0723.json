  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\t\tSection 1.  Title 3 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York is hereby amended by adding a new section 3-716, to read as follows:\nSection 3-716.  Receipt of post election contributions from previous contributors for debt repayment.\n1. Four years after the date of any covered election, a participating candidate, who has incurred debt as a result of his or her participation in such covered election and has not been a participating candidate in a subsequent covered election, may accept contributions from contributors who previously contributed to the participating candidate's campaign for such covered election for purposes of debt repayment only.  Debt payment shall include expenses incurred in maintaining a Committee until debt is repayed and expenses incurred as a result of repaying the debt. \n2. A participating candidate who chooses to accept contributions pursuant to paragraph one of this section shall designate a single committee to accept such contributions.\na. The designated committee shall register with the campaign finance board in accordance with the campaign finance board's rules providing for such registration.\nb. The designated committee shall report, to the best of the participating candidate's, treasurer's, and committee's knowledge, to the campaign finance board every contribution received by the committee, the full name, residential address, occupation, employer, and business address of each individual, corporation, partnership, political committee, employee organization or other entity making, or which is the intermediary for, such contribution.  An intermediary need not be reported for any contribution that was collected from a contributor in connection with a party or other candidate-related event held at the residence of the person delivering the contribution, unless the expenses at such events at such residence for such candidate exceed five hundred dollars or the aggregate contributions received from that contributor at such events exceed five hundred dollars.  Contributions pursuant to paragraph one aggregating not more than ninety-nine dollars from any one contributor need not be separately itemized in disclosure reports submitted to the campaign finance board on behalf of a participating candidate.  For purposes of this section, the treasurer of the designated committee need not collect or disclose the occupation, employer, and business address of any contributor pursuant to paragraph one making contributions aggregating not more than ninety-nine dollars.  Such reports shall be submitted at such times and in such form as the campaign finance board shall require and shall be clearly legible.  The committee designated to accept contributions pursuant to paragraph one of this section shall maintain any additional records of receipts and debt repayment expenditures as required by the campaign finance board.  \n3. A participating candidate accepting contributions pursuant to paragraph one of this section shall not accept and his or her designated committee shall not accept, either directly or by transfer, any contribution or contributions from any one individual,  partnership, political committee, employee organization or other entity which in the aggregate: (i) for the office of mayor, public advocate or comptroller, shall exceed four thousand five hundred dollars, or (ii) for borough president, shall exceed three thousand five hundred dollars, or (iii) for member of the city council, shall exceed two thousand five hundred dollars; provided that a candidate and his or her designated committee may accept post election contributions which do not exceed one half the amount of the applicable limitation for the repayment of debt incurred as the result of participation in any run-off primary election, additional day for voting held pursuant to section 3-108 of the election law, special election to fill a vacancy, or election held pursuant to court order as set forth in this section; and provided further that if state law prescribes a contribution limitation of a lesser amount, this paragraph shall not be deemed to authorize acceptance of a contribution in excess of such lesser amount.  The maximum post election contributions set forth in this subdivision shall be adjusted in accordance with the COLA provisions of subdivision seven of section 3-703.\n4. After debt repayment is realized, the participating candidate shall no longer accept contributions pursuant to this section.  If any excess funds remain after debt repayment is realized, the participating candidate shall return such excess funds to contributors in reverse order of contribution, beginning with the most recent contributor, until the excess funds are exhausted.\n   �2.  This local law shall become effective immediately.",
