[The license to the firm, partnership, or corporation remains valid only if a qualified representative continues to be associated with the business, or a new representative whose qualifications are acceptable to the department is designated within thirty (30) days.]  Except as otherwise provided by rule, a master electrician business whether in the form of a corporation, a partnership or a sole proprietorship, may continue to engage in the business of performing electrical work only so long as the responsible representative of such business identified on the application for approval of the master electrician business remains an officer of such corporation, a partner of such partnership or the proprietor of such sole proprietorship unless the department approves a change in the responsible representative as provided in this section.  The commissioner may promulgate rules providing for the continuation of a master electrician business pending the approval of a new responsible representative.  Except as otherwise provided in such rules, the revocation, suspension, voluntary surrender or non-renewal of the master electrician's license of the responsible representative of a master electrician business automatically revokes its approval to do business and cancels any delegation of authority given by such responsible representative to another master electrician associated with such business pending the approval by the department of a new responsible representative.\n\t9.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions above enumerated, automatically withdraws the approval and cancels the license previously held].

If the business is conducted under a trade name, or is a partnership or corporation, the trade name, partnership, or corporate name shall be displayed prominently in a manner provided by rule.\n\t13.  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent  two or more master electrician businesses from entering into a joint venture of limited duration for a particular project in accordance with the rules of the department.  An application for a permit or certificate for electrical work involving a joint venture shall so indicate on the application  and shall identify all of the master electrician businesses that are parties to such joint venture by name and authorization number and the names and  license numbers of the responsible representatives of such businesses.  The application shall be signed by the responsible representative of one of the parties to the joint venture on behalf of all such parties and all of such  parties  shall be jointly and severally liable for any fees due with respect to electrical work performed by such joint venture and for violations of this chapter and the rules of the department arising out of such work.\n\tb.

If a master electrician's or special electrician's license is suspended for cause, and the restoration thereof is conditional upon some action to be taken by the holder of the master electrician's or special electrician's license and the holder fails to take action before the expiration of the license, such failure shall be cause for the denial of the subsequent application to renew the license and seal.\n\t� 12. Section 27-3016 of such code, as last amended by local law number 38 for the year 1990, is amended to read as follows:\n\t� 27-3016  Suspension, revocation or voluntary surrender of master electrician's and special electrician's licenses and suspension or revocation of approval of master electrician business.\n\ta.  1.
