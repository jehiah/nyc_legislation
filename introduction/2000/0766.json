The allowance of a tentative carryback adjustment based upon a net operating loss carryback or net capital loss carryback pursuant to section sixty-four hundred eleven of the internal revenue code shall be treated as a final determination for purposes of this subdivision.  Any taxpayer filing an amended return with such department shall also file within ninety days thereafter an amended report with the commissioner of finance.\n      �11.  Subdivision 1 of section 11-608 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\n      1.

Subdivision 1-a through 1-f of section 11-608 of the administrative code of the city of New York are REPEALED.\n      �13.  Paragraph (d) of subdivision 3 of section 11-674 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\n      (d) Deficiency attributable to [net operating loss] carryback.  If a deficiency of tax under subchapter two of this chapter is attributable to the application to taxpayer of a net operating loss carryback or a capital loss carryback, it may be assessed at any time that a deficiency for the taxable year of the loss may be assessed.\n      �14.  Subdivision 5 of section 11-675 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as renumbered by chapter 241 of the laws of 1989, is amended to read as follows: \n      5.  Tax reduction by carryback.  If the amount of tax under subchapter two for any taxable years is reduced by reason of a carryback of a net operating loss or a capital loss, such reduction in tax shall not affect the computation of interest under this section for the period ending with the filing date for the taxable year in which the net operating loss or capital loss arises.  Such filing date shall be determined without regard to extensions of time to file.\n      �15.  Subdivision 4 of section 11-678 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\n      4.

Where such claim for credit or refund is filed after the expiration of the period prescribed in subdivision one or in subdivision two where applicable, in respect to the taxable year to which the net operating loss or capital loss is carried back, the amount of such credit or refund shall be computed without change of the allocation of income or capital upon which the taxpayer's return (or any additional assessment) was based. \n      �16.  Subdivision 4 of section 11-679 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\n      4.  Refund of tax caused by carryback.  For purposes of this section, if any overpayment of tax imposed by subchapter two of this chapter results from a carryback of a net operating loss or a net capital loss, such overpayment shall be deemed not to have been made prior to the filing date for the taxable year in which such net operating loss or net capital loss arises.  Such filing date shall be determined without regard to extensions of time to file.  For purposes of subdivision three of this section any overpayment described herein shall be treated as an overpayment for the loss year and such subdivision shall be applied with respect to such overpayment by treating the return for the loss year as not filed before claim for such overpayment is filed.  The term \"loss year\" means the taxable year in which such loss arises.\n      �17.  Subdivision 2 of section 11-680 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by chapter by chapter 808 of the laws of 1992, is amended to read as follows:\n      2.  Petition for redetermination of a deficiency.  Within ninety days, or one hundred fifty days if the notice is addressed to a taxpayer whose last known address is outside the United States, after the mailing of the notice of deficiency authorized by section 11-672 of this subchapter, or if the commissioner of finance has established a conciliation procedure pursuant to section 11-124 of the code and the taxpayer has requested a conciliation conference in accordance therewith, after ninety days from the mailing of the conciliation decision or the date of the commissioner's confirmation of the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding, the taxpayer may file a petition with the tax appeals tribunal for redetermination of the deficiency.  Such petition may also assert a claim for refund for the same taxable year or years, subject to the limitations of subdivision seven of section 11-678 of this subchapter.  For special restriction where the notice of deficiency relates to a proposed assessment made as a result of:  (a) a net operating loss carryback or a capital loss carryback, (b) an increase or decrease in federal or New York state taxable income or other basis of tax or federal or New York state tax, or (c) a federal or New York state change or correction or renegotiation, or computation or recomputation of tax, which is treated in the same manner as if it were deficiency for federal or New York state income tax purposes, see paragraph (g) of subdivision three of section 11-674 of this subchapter.\n      �18.  Paragraph (c) of subdivision 10 of section 11-683 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\n      (c) All taxes, additions to tax, penalties and interest which have become a lien under this subdivision shall [,] cease to be a lien after the expiration of [ten] twenty years from the date they became due and payable, [cease to be a lien,] except the taxes, additions to tax, penalties and interest which have become a lien under this subdivision (1) as to real estate in the hands of persons who are owners thereof who would be purchasers in good faith but for such taxes, additions to tax, penalties or interest and (2) as to lien on real estate of mortgages held by persons who would be holders there of in good faith but for such taxes, additions to tax, penalties or interests, as against such purchasers [of] or holders, shall cease to be lien after the expiration of ten years from the date they become due and payable.
