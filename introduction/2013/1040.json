Title 6 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 6-138 to read as follows:\n      �6-138.  Reporting on the expenditure of Hurricane Sandy funds. \n      a.  Definitions.  For purposes of this section, the following terms shall have the following meanings:\n      (1)  \"Hurricane Sandy funds\" means any federal funds, or local or state funds derived from federal funds, appropriated by Federal Public Law 113-2, an act making supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year September 30, 2013, to improve and streamline disaster assistance for Hurricane Sandy, that are administered or disbursed by the city and provided to a recipient in an amount exceeding one hundred thousand dollars to recover or rebuild from Hurricane Sandy. \n      (2)  \"Hurricane Sandy funded projects\" means any construction, services, or programs, paid for, in whole or in part, with any Hurricane Sandy funds.\n      (3)  \"Recipient\" means any person or entity, including any individual, sole proprietorship, partnership, association, joint venture, limited liability company, corporation or any other form of doing business, awarded Hurricane Sandy funds.\n      b.

This local law shall not require reporting on any contracts entered into prior to the effective date of this local law where the reporting requirements of this local law would require collecting information that is not available to the city, and cannot reasonably be obtained by the city.\n      �3. If any provision of this local law or the application thereof shall for any reason be adjudged by any court to competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unconstitutional, such judgment shall not effect, impair or invalidate the remainder of this local law.  \n      �4. Data maintained pursuant to this local law shall also be subject to chapter 5 of title 23 of the administrative code, where such chapter is otherwise applicable.\n      �5.
