  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection 1. Section 20-225 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 70 for the year 1990, subdivisions a, e, f, g, i and j as amended by local law number 8 for the year 2003, subdivision b as amended by local law number 10 for the year 1991, and subdivision h as added by local law number 70 for the year 1990, is amended to read as follows:\n\t� 20-225 Review and approval of petitions for revocable consents to construct and operate enclosed sidewalk cafes which do not require special permits. A petition for a revocable consent to construct and operate an enclosed sidewalk cafe which does not require a special permit modification pursuant to the zoning resolution shall be reviewed and approved in the following manner:\n\ta. The petition shall be in such form as prescribed by the department. The petition shall be filed with the department which, within five days of the filing of such petition, shall forward copies thereof to the department of city planning, the department of environmental protection and the landmarks preservation commission for review pursuant to subdivision b of this section.  The department shall forward copies of the petition, within five days of the filing of such petition, to the speaker of the council and to the council member in whose district the cafe is proposed to be located, for informational purposes.\n\tb. The agencies to which the petition has been forwarded shall review the petition and shall indicate any objections to such petition, including any determination by the landmarks preservation commission that the petition requires a certificate of appropriateness, by filing written comments with the department of city planning within twenty-one days of the receipt thereof.  The failure of an agency to indicate its objections within the prescribed time to the department of city planning shall be construed to mean that such agency has no objections.  \n\tc. If no objections to such petition are filed within the twenty-one day period prescribed in subdivision b of this section, the department of city planning shall forward the petition within five days after the close of such period to the president of the borough in which the cafe is proposed to be located, for information purposes, and to the community board for the community district in which the cafe is proposed to be located, and such board shall review such petition pursuant to subdivision e of this section.\n\td. If any objections exist, including any objections by the department of city planning, the department of city planning shall inform the petitioner of the objections and that review of the petition has been stayed until the objections indicated are resolved. If the objections are not resolved within six months from the date the petitioner is informed that review of the petition has been stayed, such petition shall be deemed to have been withdrawn. If the objections are resolved within the prescribed time, the department of city planning shall forward the petition within five days of such resolution to the council member in whose district the cafe is proposed to be located and to the community board for the community district in which the cafe is proposed to be located, and such board shall review the petition pursuant to subdivision e of this section. \n\te. The community board shall, not later than forty-five days after receipt of such petition, either (i) notify the public of the petition in a manner specified by the city planning commission, conduct a public hearing thereon and submit a written recommendation to the department and to the council or (ii) waive by a written statement its public hearing and recommendation on such petition, and submit such statement to the department and to the council. If the community board submits a recommendation on a petition after the forty-five day time period has expired, such recommendation may be accepted by the department at the sole discretion of the commissioner.\n\tf. Within thirty days after the expiration of the forty-five day period allowed for the filing of a recommendation or waiver by the community board pursuant to subdivision e of this section, the department shall (i) hold a public hearing on the petition, (ii) approve the petition, disapprove it or approve it with modifications, and (iii) file with the council any such decision to approve or approve with modifications, together with the petition, except that if the department waives its public hearing, the department shall file with the council a written statement of such waiver and any decision to approve or approve with modifications, together with the petition, within ten days after the expiration of the period allowed for the community board filing of a recommendation or waiver pursuant to subdivision e of this section.  If [within the time period provided,] the department fails to [take the actions on a petition] file with the council any decision to approve or approve with modifications, together with the petition, as provided [for] in the preceding sentence, the petition shall be deemed to have been denied, unless the petitioner submits a request in writing to the department for an additional period of time, which shall not exceed one hundred eighty days, to correct any deficiencies in the petition.  [For] Unless the department waives its public hearing, for a period of not less than fifteen calendar days prior to the date of such public hearing, the petitioner shall post notice of the public hearing in a place conspicuous to public view at the location of the proposed sidewalk cafe. At least fifteen days prior to the date of such hearing, the department shall give notice to the community board for the district in which the cafe is proposed to be located, to the president of the borough in which the cafe is proposed to be located and to the council member in whose district the cafe is proposed to be located. Not less than five calendar days prior to the date of any such hearing, notice of the hearing shall be published in the City Record and in one newspaper of local circulation in the community where the cafe is proposed to be located. No other notice requirements shall apply to hearings for revocable consents for sidewalk cafes.\n      g.
