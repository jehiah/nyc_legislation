  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      Section 1. Section 16-509 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new subdivision e to read as follows:\n      e. On or after January first, two thousand nineteen, the commission may refuse to issue a license or registration to an applicant that has failed to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the commission that such applicant will meet the requirements of section 24-163.11 of the code, or any rule promulgated pursuant thereto, in the performance of such license or registration, unless such applicant has been issued a waiver for financial hardship, or has submitted an application for such waiver in accordance with the provisions of subdivision c of section 24-163.11 of the code and such application is pending with the commission. \n      � 2. Subdivision a of section 16-513 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 42 for the year 1996, is amended to read as follows:\n      a. In addition to the penalties provided in section 16-515 of this chapter, the commission may, after due notice and opportunity to be heard, revoke or suspend a license or registration issued pursuant to the provisions of this chapter when the registrant or licensee and/or its principals, employees and/or agents: (i) have been found to be in violation of this chapter or any rules promulgated pursuant thereto; (ii) have been found by a court or administrative tribunal of competent jurisdiction to have violated: (A) any provision of section 16-119 of this code, or any rule promulgated pursuant thereto, relating to illegal dumping, (B) any provision of section 16-120.1 of this code, or any rule promulgated pursuant thereto, relating to the disposal of regulated medical waste and other medical waste or (C) any provision of section 16-117.1 of this code, or any rule promulgated pursuant thereto, relating to the transportation and disposal of waste containing asbestos; (iii) has repeatedly failed to obey lawful orders of any person authorized by section 16-517 of this chapter to enforce the provisions hereof; (iv) has failed to pay, within the time specified by a court, the department of consumer affairs or an administrative tribunal of competent jurisdiction, any fines or civil penalties imposed pursuant to this chapter or the rules promulgated pursuant thereto; (v) has been found in persistent or substantial violation of any rule promulgated by the commission pursuant to section 16-306 of this code or by the commissioner of consumer affairs pursuant to section 16-306 or former subchapter eighteen of title twenty of this code; (vi) has been found in persistent or substantial violation of any city, state, or federal law, rule or regulation regarding the handling of trade waste, or any laws prohibiting deceptive, unfair, or unconscionable trade practices; (vii) whenever, in relation to an investigation conducted pursuant to this chapter, the commission determines, after consideration of the factors set forth in subdivision a of section 16-509 of this code, that the licensee or registrant as a trade waste broker lacks good character, honesty and integrity; (viii) whenever there has been any false statement or any misrepresentation as to a material fact in the application or accompanying papers upon which the issuance of such license or registration was based; [or] (ix) whenever the licensee or registrant has failed to notify the commission as required by subdivision b of section 16-507 or subdivision c of section 16-508 of this chapter of any change in the ownership interest of the business or other material change in the information required on the application for such license or registration, or of the arrest or criminal conviction of such licensee or registrant or any of his or her principals, employees and/or agents of which the licensee had knowledge or should have known; or (x) whenever the licensee or registrant has been found by the commission or a court or administrative tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be in violation of the provisions of section 24-163.11 of the code, or any rule promulgated pursuant thereto. \n      � 3. Subchapter 7 of chapter 1 of title 24 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 24-163.11 to read as follows:\n      �24-163.11 Trade waste vehicles. a. Definitions. When used in this section:\n      \"Best available retrofit technology\" means technology verified by the United States environmental protection agency or the California air resources board for reducing the emission of pollutants that achieves reductions in particulate matter emissions at the highest classification level for diesel emission control strategies that is applicable to a particular engine and application that has been approved for use by the commissioner.\n      \"Heavy duty trade waste hauling vehicle\" means any diesel-fuel powered vehicle with a gross weight of over sixteen thousand pounds that is owned or operated by an entity that is required to be licensed or registered by the New York city business integrity commission pursuant to section 16-505 of the code and that is operated in New York city for collection and/or removal of trade waste. \n      \"Trade waste\" shall have the same meaning as set forth in subdivision f of section 16-501 of the code. \n      b. Use of best available retrofit technology in heavy duty trade waste hauling vehicles. (1) Beginning January first, two thousand twenty, any heavy duty trade waste hauling vehicle shall utilize best available retrofit technology or be equipped with an engine certified to the applicable two thousand seven United States environmental protection agency standard for particulate matter as set forth in section 86.007-11 of title forty of the code of federal regulations or to any subsequent United States environmental protection agency standard for such pollutant that is at least as stringent. \n      (2) On or before June thirtieth, two thousand eighteen, the commissioner shall review the technology verified by the United States environmental protection agency and the California air resources board for reducing the emission of pollutants that achieves reductions in particulate matter emissions at the highest classification level for diesel emission control strategies that is applicable to a particular engine and application and shall promulgate rules setting forth the best available retrofit technology to be used by heavy duty trade waste hauling vehicles to which this section applies. Such rules shall be reviewed on a regular basis, but in no event less often than once every six months, and shall be revised, as needed. \n      c. Waivers; financial hardship. The chairperson of the business integrity commission may issue a waiver of the requirements of paragraph one of subdivision b of this section if the chairperson finds that the applicant for such waiver has demonstrated that compliance with such requirements would cause undue financial hardship on the applicant. An application for such waiver must be filed with the business integrity commission on or before January first, two thousand nineteen, or in the case of an applicant that applies for a license or registration with the business integrity commission pursuant to section 16-505 of the code for the first time after January first, two thousand nineteen, an application for such waiver shall be filed no later than the date on which such license or registration application is filed with the commission. An application for renewal of an existing waiver must be filed no later than one hundred eighty days before the expiration of such waiver. Any waiver issued pursuant to this paragraph shall expire no later than two years after issuance. All waivers issued pursuant to this subdivision shall expire no later than January first, two thousand twenty-five. The provisions of paragraph one of subdivision b of this section shall not apply to an applicant that has submitted an application for a waiver in accordance with the provisions of this subdivision while such application is pending with the commission, nor for ninety days after the date of a denial of such waiver.\n      d. Enforcement. (1) In addition to the department, the business integrity commission shall have the authority to enforce this section and shall have the power to issue notices of violation. All notices of violation issued in accordance with this section shall be returnable to the board.\n      (2) Any owner or operator of a heavy duty trade waste hauling vehicle that violates any provision of this section shall be liable for a civil penalty of ten thousand dollars per vehicle that is in violation.
