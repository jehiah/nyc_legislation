  "TextID": 52853,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n            \n            Section 1.  Legislative findings.  Electronic cigarette devices have not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for smoking cessation and are currently unregulated by the FDA.  Most devices contain nicotine, a highly addictive substance.  Although the long-term effects of electronic cigarette devices require further study, the FDA has found that some devices contain toxins and carcinogens and has expressed concerns about their safety.  Use of electronic cigarette devices, particularly in places where smoking is prohibited, may interfere with smokers' attempts to quit by making it easier for them to maintain their nicotine addiction.  Children and youth who experiment with electronic cigarettes may become addicted to nicotine and ultimately switch to smoking cigarettes. \n            The use of electronic cigarette devices may be visually similar to the smoking of cigarettes, and has already been observed in locations where smoking is prohibited, creating concern and confusion that threatens to interfere with enforcement of the Smoke-Free Air Act. The use of electronic cigarette devices in places where smoking is prohibited may increase the social acceptability and appeal of smoking, particularly for youth, potentially undermining the enormous progress that has been made over the years in discouraging smoking.  \n            The Council therefore finds that prohibiting the use of electronic cigarette devices in public places and places of employment will protect the health of the citizens of New York City, facilitate enforcement of the Smoke-Free Air Act, and protect youth from observing behaviors that could encourage them to smoke.\n            � 2. Section 17-502 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding new subdivisions qq and rr to read as follows:\n\t\tqq.  \"Electronic cigarette\" means an electronic device that delivers vapor for inhalation.  Electronic cigarette shall include any refill, cartridge, and any other component of an electronic cigarette.  Electronic cigarette shall not include any product approved by the food and drug administration for sale as a drug or medical device.\n            rr.   \"Retail electronic cigarette store\" means a retail store devoted primarily to the sale of electronic cigarettes, and in which the sale of other products is merely incidental. The sale of such other products shall be considered incidental if such sales generate less than fifty percent of the total annual gross sales.\n            � 3. Section 17-503 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 5 for the year 1995, the heading of section 17-503 as amended by local law number 47 for the year 2002, the opening paragraph of subdivision a and paragraphs 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 14 and 15 of subdivision a as amended by local law number 47 for the year 2002, paragraphs 12, 16 and 17 of subdivision a as added by local law number 5 for the year 1995, paragraphs 19, 20, 21 and 22 of subdivision a as added by local law number 47 for the year 2002, subdivision c as added by local law number 5 for the year 1995, the opening paragraph of subdivision c and paragraph 1 of subdivision c as amended by local law number 47 for the year 2002, paragraph 6 of subdivision c as added by local law number 50 for the year 2009, paragraph 7 of subdivision c as added by local law number 11 for the year 2011, subdivision d as added by local law number 5 for the year 1995, and paragraph 3 of subdivision d as added by local law number 11 for the year 2011, is amended to read as follows:\n            � 17-503 Prohibition of smoking and use of electronic cigarettes. \n            a.

Health care facilities including, but not limited to, hospitals, clinics, psychiatric facilities, residential health care facilities, physical therapy facilities, convalescent homes, and homes for the aged; provided however, that this paragraph shall not prohibit smoking, or the use of electronic cigarettes, by patients in separate enclosed rooms of residential health care facilities or facilities where day treatment programs are provided, which are designated as smoking rooms for patients of such facilities or programs, provided, however, that prior written approval is received from the fire commissioner pursuant to section [27-4276] 310.2 of the fire code. \n            15. All schools other than public and private pre-primary, primary, and secondary schools providing instruction for students at or below the twelfth-grade level, including, but not limited to, community colleges, technical training establishments, specialty schools, colleges and universities. \n            16.

Legislative findings.  Electronic cigarette devices have not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for smoking cessation and are currently unregulated by the FDA.  Most devices contain nicotine, a highly addictive substance.  Although the long-term effects of electronic cigarette devices require further study, the FDA has found that some devices contain toxins and carcinogens and has expressed concerns about their safety.  Use of electronic cigarette devices, particularly in places where smoking is prohibited, may interfere with smokers\\rquote  attempts to quit by making it easier for them to maintain their nicotine addiction.  Children and youth who experiment with electronic cigarettes may become addicted to nicotine and ultimately switch to smoking cigarettes. \\par\nThe use of electronic cigarette devices may be visually similar to the smoking of cigarettes, and has already been observed in locations where smoking is prohibited, creating concern and confusion that threatens to interfere with enforcement of the Smoke-Free Air Act. The use of electronic cigarette devices in places where smoking is prohibited may increase the social acceptability and appeal of smoking, particularly for youth, potentially undermining the enormous progress that has been made over the years in discouraging smoking.  \\par\nThe Council therefore finds that prohibiting the use of electronic cigarette devices in public places and places of employment will protect the health of the citizens of New York City, facilitate enforcement of the Smoke-Free Air Act, and protect youth from observing behaviors that could encourage them to smoke.\\par\n\\'a7 2.
