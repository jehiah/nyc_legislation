Any notice of violation, appearance ticket or summons issued for a violation of this section shall be returnable before the environmental control board which shall impose the penalty herein provided.  \n      � 2. Section 20-275 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\n      � 20-275. Violation. a. Any person who shall violate any of the provisions of this subchapter or any rule or regulation issued thereunder shall be guilty of a class A misdemeanor and upon the first conviction be subject to a fine of at least five hundred dollars and upon any subsequent convictions be subject to a fine or one thousand dollars and/or imprisonment of at least fifteen days.\n      b. Any person who violates any of the provisions of this subchapter or any rule or regulation issued thereunder shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more than five hundred dollars for each violation; except that a person shall not be subject to such civil penalty for a  first-time violation of section 20-270 or 20-271 of this subchapter or any rule or regulation issued thereunder, if such person proves to the satisfaction of the department, within thirty days of the issuance of the notice of violation and prior to the commencement of an adjudication of the violation, that the violation has been cured. The submission of proof of a cure shall be deemed an admission of liability for all purposes. The option of presenting proof that the violation has been cured shall be offered as part of any settlement offer made by the department to a person who has received, for the first time, a notice of violation of section 20-270 or section 20-271 of this subchapter or any rule or regulation issued thereunder.
