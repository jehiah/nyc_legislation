  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\nSection 1. Subchapter 2 of chapter 1 of title 3 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 3-124, to read as follows:\n§3-124. Study and report on the effects of wind on certain buildings. a. The office of long-term planning and sustainability in consultation with the department of buildings shall undertake a study and submit a report to the mayor and the speaker of the city council, on the effects of wind on existing buildings, including existing buildings that are raised, and buildings that are under construction in the city of New York. Such report and accompanying recommendations shall be provided no later than two years from the effective date of the local law that added this section and shall include the following:\n1. An analysis to determine the types of existing buildings that are at risk of causing falling debris, based on the age, construction classification, construction methods and materials, height, and occupancy use of such buildings; \n2. An analysis of the effects of wind on existing buildings that are raised, lifted, elevated or moved in order to comply with Appendix G of the New York city building code or to address flood hazard concerns;\n3. An analysis of the effects of wind on buildings that are under construction, including the effects of wind on buildings with incomplete façade assemblies, temporary installations used in construction, and construction materials that are stored on construction sites; \n4. An analysis of forecasts related to potential changes in the frequency, intensity, and path of future storm events along with consideration of whether climate change may impact wind speeds; and \n5. An examination of the benefits of installing and maintaining weather stations across the city, including on high-rise buildings, to better understand localized wind patterns. \nb. The report shall include recommendations on paragraphs one through five of subdivision a of this section as well as recommendations on whether the applicable wind loads under the city’s building code should be revised; whether standard wind plans for sites in various stages of construction are needed, including plans regarding equipment and temporary structures such as cranes, derricks, scaffolds, concrete formwork and sidewalk bridges; how equipment and temporary structures such as cranes, derricks, scaffolds, concrete formwork and sidewalk bridges should be designed and secured in light of wind effects; whether changes to the building code or department of buildings rules related to façade work filing and inspection exemptions or safety inspection requirements are necessary and what wind load requirements should be applied to existing buildings.\n§ 2. This local law shall take effect immediately.\nJCH\n9/16/2013 4:58 PM",
