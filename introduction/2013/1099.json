The following buildings shall be protected with an impact-resistant covering or glazing in accordance with the Missile Levels and Wind Zones specified in ASTM E1886 and ASTM E1996 or other approved test methods and performance criteria:\n1. Buildings in Structural Occupancy Category IV, as defined in Table 1604.5, located in Exposure C or D, as defined in Section 1609.4; \n2. Buildings in Structural Occupancy Category III, as defined in Table 1604.5, located in Exposure D, as defined in Section 1609.4, where the glazing of such building encloses places of assembly for 300 or more persons or areas of in-place shelter. \nException: Glazing protection in accordance with Section 1609.1.2 shall not be required if the glazing is located more than 60 feet (18 288 mm) above the ground and more than 30 feet (9144 mm) above aggregate-surfaced roofs, including roofs with gravel or stone ballast located within 1,500 feet (457.2 m) of the building. \n1609.1.2.1 Louvers. Louvers protecting intake and exhaust ventilation ducts not assumed to be open that are located within 30 feet (9144 mm) of grade shall meet the requirements of an approved impact-resisting standard or the large missile test of ASTM E 1996.\n1609.1.2.2 Garage doors.
