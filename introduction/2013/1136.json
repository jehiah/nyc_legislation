  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection 1. Legislative Intent.  The Council hereby finds that there is no comprehensive cultural plan for the City.  There is no measure of what is considered an acceptable level of cultural resources and how such resources should be provided.  It is important to understand the scope of cultural services throughout the City, where these services are lacking and how cultural service gaps may be filled.  The cultural plan would identify the current level of service of cultural groups in each neighborhood; detail the feedback from community outreach, establish a strategy to meet the specified needs of each community; quantify the economic impact of arts and culture in the City; and ultimately put forth a targeted approach to increase cultural activity citywide, increase the economic impact of the arts and culture, and provide support to individual and emerging artists in the City.\n\t� 2.  Chapter 67 of the charter of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 2506 to read as follows:\n\t� 2506. Cultural plan. 1. On or before July 1, 2015, the commissioner shall produce and post on its website a comprehensive cultural plan for New York city to be submitted to the mayor and council.
