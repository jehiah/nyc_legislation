  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection 1. Section 715.1 of the New York city plumbing code, as added by local law number 99 for the year 2005, is amended to read as follows:\n\t715.1 Sewage backflow. Where fixtures, floor drains, or area drains are subject to overflow as the result of backwater from the public sewer system, accessible backwater valves shall be installed in the fixture drain pipe from such fixture, in the branch drain to such area drain or group of fixtures, or in the building drain at its point of exit from the building and downstream from the building trap. Buildings located in areas of special flood hazard, as established by Section G102.2 of Appendix G of the New York City Building Code, shall be deemed to be subject to overflow as the result of backwater from the public sewer system and shall be provided with backwater valves in accordance with the requirements of Section 7.3.3 of ASCE 24 as modified by Appendix G of the New York City Building Code.\n\t§ 2. The New York city plumbing code is amended by adding a new section 1101.9.1 to read as follows:\n\t1101.9.1 Backwater valves in special flood hazard areas. Backwater valves shall be installed in storm drainage systems in accordance with Section 7.3.4 of ASCE 24 as modified by Appendix G of the New York City Building Code for all buildings located in the areas of special flood hazard, as established by Section G102.2 of Appendix G of the New York City Building Code.\n\n\t§ 3. Section BC G501.1 of the New York city building code, as added by local law number 33 for the year 2007, is amended by adding two new amendments to sections 7.3.3 and 7.3.4 of ASCE 24-05 to read as follows:\n\tSection 7.3.3. Section 7.3.3 is amended to read as follows:\n7.3.3 Plumbing Systems Installed Below Minimum Elevations. Plumbing systems and components, including plumbing fixtures, shall be elevated above the elevation specified in Table 7-1. Where plumbing systems and components have openings below the elevation specified in Table 7-1, the openings shall be protected with automatic backwater valves or other automatic backflow devices. Devices shall be installed in each line that extends below the DFE to prevent release of sewage into floodwaters and to prevent infiltration by floodwaters into the plumbing. Redundant devices requiring human intervention shall be permitted. Plumbing systems shall be provided with backwater valves in the building drain at its point of exit from the building and downstream of the building trap.\n\tSection 7.3.4. Section 7.3.4 is amended to read as follows:\n7.3.4 Sanitary Systems. Sanitary systems shall be designed to minimize infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters. Vents and openings shall be above the elevation specified in Table 7-1. Sanitary system storage tanks shall be designed, constructed, installed, and anchored to resist at least 1.5 times the potential buoyant and other flood forces acting on an empty tank during design flood conditions. Tanks and piping shall be installed to resist local scour and erosion. Sanitary systems shall be provided with backwater valves at the point of exit from the building and downstream of the building trap. Sanitary systems that must remain operational during or immediately after the design flood or lesser floods shall be equipped with a sealed storage tank that is sized to store at least 150% of the anticipated sewage flow associated with occupancy during flood conditions and during subsequent periods of saturated soil when sewage will not percolate.\n\t§ 4. This local law shall take effect ninety days after its enactment.\nSS",
