Such term shall not include rigid polystyrene.\n            \"Food service establishment\" means a premises or part of a premises where food is provided directly to the consumer whether such food is provided free of charge or sold, and whether consumption occurs on or off the premises or is provided from a pushcart, stand or vehicle.

Such financial hardship waiver shall be valid for twelve months and shall be renewable upon application to the commissioner of small business services. A pending application for such financial hardship waiver shall be a defense to any notice of violation issued pursuant to this section to which such pending application relates and such notice of violation shall be dismissed.\n            f.
