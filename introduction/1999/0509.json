  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n      Section 1. Declaration of Legislative Findings and Intent.  The Council hereby recognizes that City Hall is the principal seat of government for the city of New York housing both the legislative and executive branches of government. The steps of City Hall and the areas adjacent have long served as settings for press conferences, public ceremonies, and political or other ideological expressive gatherings among individuals engaged in peaceful protest. Government may impose reasonable restrictions on time, place and manner of protected speech, even of speech in a public forum, provided those restrictions are justified without reference to the content of regulated speech, are narrowly tailored to serve significant governmental interest, and leave open alternative channels for communication of information.  The Council, however, finds that in recent years, controversies have developed with respect to the circumstances and conditions under which individuals and various groups have been granted or denied access to the steps of City Hall for the purposes of engaging is such expressive activities and such actions have lead to litigation against the city.  The Council further recognizes that the right of access to public buildings and the right to petition the government find their source in the United States Constitution, in particular, the First Amendment's free speech and right to petition clauses, as well as the due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments and the New York State Constitution.  Thus, any denial of access to the steps of our City's seat of government must withstand close scrutiny and be carefully circumscribed. Because the Council recognizes that in providing access to this forum to members of the public, there is a need to balance the compelling concern to preserve safety and security with the fundamental right to freedom of expression, the Council is hereby enacting the City Hall Access Law which will authorize the Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) to monitor, regulate and manage the use of the steps of City Hall for expressive purposes consistent with constitutional safeguards required by the United States Constitution, the New York State Constitution, and case law interpreting this fundamental freedom. \n      �2.\tChapter 2 of Title 4 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York is hereby amended by adding a new section 4-207, to read as follows: \n      �4-207 a.
