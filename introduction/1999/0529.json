  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tChapter five of title twenty of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new subchapter thirteen to read as follows:\nSUBCHAPTER 13\nTRAVEL AGENCIES\n \t�20-759  Legislative findings and intent.  The council hereby finds that there is a growing problem in New York City caused by some unscrupulous travel agencies who open businesses and target immigrant communities, often collecting money for services that are never provided.  These businesses often collect money from unsuspecting immigrants seeking to purchase tickets for expensive overseas travel and, either intentionally or due to unintentional financial hardship, go out of business having accepted money from these consumers without providing the promised travel arrangements.  Because these businesses are not licensed or registered, it is difficult, if not impossible, to locate these persons after the business has closed.  Oftentimes, the same people will open other agencies using a different name and repeat the unscrupulous practices.\n\tThese practices have made complaints from consumers of travel services one of the top complaint categories in New York City for the last several years according to the Department of Consumer Affairs.  Not wanting to interfere with the relationships between travel agents and the carriers, and providers of lodgings and accommodations they represent, but recognizing the need to address this growing problem in our City, the Council hereby requires registration of travel agencies and the posting by such agencies of a bond, cash equivalent or payment of contributions to a fund administered by the Department, to ensure that consumers who fall victim to such practices can be reimbursed, while at the same time eschewing the regulation of ticketing practices, and other services provided by travel agencies, and deems the conduct of the business of a travel agent without having registered and provided the security required hereunder to be an unconscionable trade practice.\n\t�20-760.  Definitions.  a.  \"travel agency\" means any person, firm, corporation,  partnership or association, other than a common carrier or employee of a common carrier or a rental car agency or employee of a rental car agency, who engages in the business, either as principal or agent,  of selling or offering for sale any travel services, or negotiating for or holding himself out by solicitation, advertisement or otherwise as in the business of selling, providing, furnishing contracting or arranging for such travel services.  For purposes of this subchapter, \"carrier\" means any person, firm, corporation, partnership or association engaged in the business of transporting persons for hire.\n\tb.  \"Travel services\" means public transportation, public accommodations in hotels, motels or motor courts or any other service related to travel.\n\t�20-761.  Registration required; fee; application.  a.  It shall be unlawful for any person to conduct the business of a travel agency without having filed a registration statement with the department pursuant to this subchapter. Such registration statement shall be in a form prescribed by rule of the commissioner.  Upon the filing of a registration statement and the posting of a bond or other security in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter, each registrant shall be issued a certificate of registration by the department indicating that the travel agency has registered with the department and posted the bond or other security in accordance herewith.  Each registrant shall conspicuously post such certificate on the premises where such service is conducted.\n      b.  The biennial registration fee to be paid by such persons shall be two hundred dollars.  \n      �20-762.  Bond required.  a.  Every travel agency shall file, and at all times maintain with the department, in form and substance satisfactory to the commissioner a bond with a corporate surety, from a company authorized to do business in the state.\n      b.  The principal sum of the bond shall be as follows:\n      1.  For a registrant with fewer than three locations in the city of New York, fifty thousand dollars; or\n2. For a registrant with three to four locations, one hundred thousand dollars;\n3. For a registrant with five to six locations, one hundred fifty thousand dollars;\n4. For a registrant with seven to nine locations, two hundred thousand dollars; and\n5. For a registrant with ten or more locations, two hundred fifty thousand dollars.\n      c.  The bond shall be payable in favor of the city of  New York, or its agent as designated by rule promulgated by the commissioner, for the benefit of any consumer injured by such registrant in the event such registrant goes out of business after having collected money from any consumer but prior to having provided all or a portion of any travel services for which such consumer had paid.\n      d.  The commissioner may by rule establish a fund to be administered by the comptroller and authorize an applicant for a travel agency's registration to, in lieu of a bond, make contributions to such fund to satisfy the requirements of this section.        \n      �20-763  Complaint; answer.  (a) Any person who has paid money to a travel agency who has gone out of business without providing all or any portion of the travel services for which payment was made may, by himself or herself or such person's attorney, make, sign and file with the commissioner a verified complaint in writing which shall (i) identify the travel agency alleged to have gone out of business without providing all or any portion of the travel services for which payment was made; (ii) set forth the particulars of the transaction; and (iii) contain any other information as may be required by the commissioner.  The commissioner shall cause such complaint to be served upon the respondent and all such persons it deems to be necessary parties.\n      b. The department shall not have jurisdiction over any complaint: (i) that has been filed more than one year after the alleged transaction occurred; (ii) if the complainant has previously initiated a civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction alleging that such travel agency collected money for travel services and went out of business without providing all or any portion of the travel services for which payment was made, unless such civil action has been dismissed without prejudice or withdrawn without prejudice; or  (iii) if the complainant has previously filed and has an action or proceeding before any administrative agency under any other law of the state alleging that such travel agency collected money for travel services and went out of business without providing all or any portion of the travel services for which payment was made.\n      c.  Within thirty days after a copy of the complaint is served upon the respondent by the department, the respondent shall file a written, verified answer thereto and the commissioner shall cause a copy of such answer to be served upon any necessary party.\n      d.  The respondent shall specifically admit, deny or explain each of the facts alleged in the complaint , unless the respondent is without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief, in which case the respondent shall so state, and such statement shall operate as a denial.  Any allegation in the complaint not specifically denied or explained shall be deemed admitted and shall be so found by the commissioner unless good cause to the contrary is shown.\n      e.  All affirmative defenses shall be stated separately in the answer.\n      f. Any necessary party may file with the department a written, verified answer to the complaint, and the department shall cause a copy of such answer to be served upon the complainant, respondent and any other necessary party.\n      �20-764  Withdrawal of complaints.  a.  A complaint filed pursuant to section 20-763 of this subchapter may be withdrawn by the complainant in accordance with rules promulgated by the department at any time prior to the service of a notice that the complaint has been referred to an administrative law judge.  Such a withdrawal shall be in writing and signed by the complainant.\n      b.  A complaint may be withdrawn after service of such notice at the discretion of the department.\n      c.  Unless the complaint is withdrawn pursuant to a conciliation agreement, the withdrawal of a complaint shall be without prejudice: (i) to the continued prosecution of the complaint by the department in accordance with its rules; (ii) to the initiation of a complaint by the department based in whole or in part on the same facts; or (iii) to the commencement of a civil action by the corporation counsel based upon the same facts pursuant to chapter four of this title.       \n      ( 20-765 Dismissal of complaint. a. The department may, in its discretion, dismiss a complaint at any time prior to the taking of testimony at a hearing for any of the following circumstances:\n\t(1) department personnel have been unable to locate the complainant after diligent efforts to do so;\n\t(2) the complainant has repeatedly failed to appear at mutually agreed upon appointments with department personnel or is unwilling to meet with department personnel, provide requested documentation, or to attend a hearing;\n\t(3) the complainant has repeatedly engaged in conduct which is disruptive to the orderly functioning of the department;\n\t(4) the complainant is unwilling to accept a reasonable proposed conciliation agreement;\n\t(5) prosecution of the complaint will not serve the public interest; \n      (6) the complainant requests such dismissal, one hundred eighty days have elapsed since the filing of the complaint with the department and the department finds (a) that the complaint has not been actively investigated, and (b) that the respondent will not be unduly prejudiced thereby.\n\tb. The department shall dismiss a complaint at any time prior to the filing of an answer by the respondent, if the complainant requests such dismissal, unless the department has conducted an investigation of the complaint or has engaged the parties in conciliation after the filing of the complaint.\n\tc. In accordance with the rules of the department, the department shall dismiss a complaint if the complaint is not within its jurisdiction.\n      d. If, after the investigation the department determines that probable cause does not exist to believe that the respondent has gone out of business after having taken payment for travel services without providing all or a portion of the services paid for, the department shall dismiss the complaint as to such respondent.\n\te. The department shall promptly serve notice upon the complainant, respondent and any necessary party of any dismissal pursuant to this section.\n      f. The complainant or respondent may, within thirty days of such service, and in accordance with the rules of the department, apply to the chairperson for review of any dismissal pursuant to this section. Upon such application, the commissioner shall review such action and issue an order affirming, reversing or modifying such determination or remanding the matter for further investigation and action. A copy of such order shall be served upon the complainant, respondent and any necessary party.\n      (20-766 Mediation and conciliation. a. If in the judgment of the department circumstances so warrant, it may at any time after the filing of a complaint endeavor to resolve the complaint by any method of dispute resolution prescribed by the rule of the department including, but not limited to, mediation and conciliation.  If, in the judgment of the department, at any time after the filing of a complaint, it appears that a respondent has not gone out of business but probable cause exists to believe that such respondent has accepted money for travel services from the complainant without having provided all or a portion of such services, the department shall endeavor to resolve the complaint by any method of dispute resolution prescribed by rule of the department, including, but not limited to, mediation and conciliation.\n      b. The terms of any conciliation agreement may contain such provisions as may be agreed upon by the department, the complaint and the respondent, including a provision for the entry in court of a consent decree embodying the terms of the conciliation agreement.\n\tc. Neither the commissioner, nor staff of the department shall publicly disclose what transpired in the course of mediation and conciliation efforts.\n\td. If a conciliation agreement is entered into, the department shall embody such agreement in an order and serve a copy of such order upon all parties to the conciliation agreement.  Violation of such an order may cause the imposition of civil penalties under section 20-124 of this chapter. Every conciliation agreement shall be made public unless the complainant and respondent agree otherwise and the department determines that disclosure is not required to further the purposes of this chapter.\n\t( 20-767 Determination of probable cause. a. Except in connection with department-initiated complaints which shall not require a determination of probable cause, where the department determines that probable cause exists to believe that the respondent has gone out of business after having accepted money for travel services without having provided all or a portion of such travel services, the department shall issue a written notice to complainant and respondent so stating.  A determination of probable cause is not a final order of the department and shall not be administratively or judicially reviewable.\n\tb.  If a determination is made pursuant to subdivision a of this section that probable cause exists, or if a department-initiated complaint has been filed, the department shall refer the complaint to an administrative law judge and shall serve a notice upon the complainant, respondent and any necessary party that the complaint has been referred.\n      (20-768  Rules of Procedure. The department shall adopt rules providing for hearing and pre-hearing procedure. These rules shall include rules providing that the department, by its prosecutorial bureau, shall be a party to all complaints and that a complainant shall be a party if the complainant has intervened in the manner set forth in the rules of the department. These rules shall also include rules governing discovery, motion practice and the issuance of subpoenas. Wherever necessary, the department shall issue orders compelling discovery. In accordance with the department's discovery rules, any party from whom discovery is sought may assert an objection to such discovery based upon claim of privilege or other defense and the department shall rule upon such objection.\n\t( 20-769 Hearing. a. A hearing on the complaint shall be held before an administrative law judge designated by the department. The place of any such hearing shall be the office of the department or such other place as may be designated by the department. Notice of the date, time and place of such hearing shall be served upon the department, respondent and any necessary party.\n\tb. The case in support of the complaint shall be presented before the department by the department's prosecutorial bureau. The complainant may present additional testimony and cross-examine witnesses, in person or by counsel, if the complainant shall have intervened pursuant to rules established by the department.\n\tc. The administrative law judge may, in his or her discretion, permit any person who has a substantial interest in the complaint to intervene as a party and may require the joinder of necessary parties.\n\td. Evidence relating to endeavors at mediation or conciliation by, between or among the commission, the complainant and the respondent shall not be admissible.\n\te. If the respondent has failed to answer the complaint within thirty days after the complaint has been served upon the resondant by the department, the administrative law judge may enter a default and the hearing shall proceed to determine the evidence in support of the complaint. Upon application, the administrative law judge may, for good cause shown, open a default in answering, upon equitable terms and conditions, including the taking of an oral answer.\n\tf. Except as other wise provided, the department by its designted staff, a respondent who has filed an answer or whose default in answering has been set aside for good cause shown, a necessary party, and a complainant or other person who has intervened pursuant to the rules of the department, may appear at such hearing in person or otherwise, with or without counsel, cross-examine witnesses, present testimony and other evidence.\n\tg. The department shall not be bound by the strict rules of evidence prevailing in courts of the state of New York.  The testimony taken at the hearing shall be under the oath and shall be transcribed.\n\t(20-770  Decision and order. a. If, upon all the evidence at the hearing, and upon the findings of fact, conclusions of law and relief recommended by an administrative law judge, the commissioner shall find that a respondent has gone out of business after having accepted money from a complainant for travel services without having provided all or a portion of such services, the commissioner shall state his or her findings of fact and conclusions of law and shall issue and cause to be served on such respondent an order requiring such respondent to pay to complainant the compensatory damages resulting from such act. \n\t\tb. If upon all the evidence at the hearing, and upon the findings of fact and conclusions of law recommended by the administrative law judge, the department shall find that a respondent has not engaged in any such act, the department shall state its findings of fact and conclusions of law and shall issue and cause to be served on the complainant, respondent, and any necessary party and on any complainant who has not intervened an order dismissing the complaint as to such respondent. \n      (20-771  Disbursements from a bond or the fund. A registrant must satisfy any outstanding judgement against him or her, within (1) thirty days from the date of entry of the judgement, or (2) if the judgment has been stayed or appealed, within thirty days from the date the stay is lifted or the appeal decided, or (3) according to a payment schedule the parties agree upon.  If such judgment is not payed within such time or payments are not made in accordance with such schedule, the commissioner may require that such judgment be satisfied or payment made from the bond or fund in accordance with rules prescribed by the commissioner.\n\t(20-772  Judicial review. a. Any complainant, respondent or other person aggrieved by a final order of the department issued pursuant to section 20-770 of this chapter or an order of the department issued pursuant to subdivision f of section 20-765 of this chapter affirming the dismissal of a complaint may obtain judicial review thereof in a proceeding as provided in this section.\n\tb. Such proceeding shall be brought in the supreme court of the state within any county within the city of New York wherein such provider of travel services conducts business.\n\tc. Such proceeding shall be initiated by the filing of a petition in such court, together with a written transcript of the record upon the hearing, before the department, and the issuance and service of a notice of motion returnable before such court. Thereupon the court shall have jurisdiction of the proceeding and of the questions determined therein, and shall have power to grant such relief as it deems just and proper, and to make and enter upon the pleadings, testimony, and proceedings set forth in such transcript an order annulling, confirming or modifying the order of the department in whole or in part.  No objection that has not been presented to the department shall be considered by the court, unless the failure or neglect to present such objection shall be excused because of extraordinary circumstances.\n\td. Any party may move the court to remit the case to the department in the interests of justice for the purpose of adducing additional specified evidence and seeking findings thereon, provided such party shows reasonable grounds for the failure to adduce such evidence before the department.\n\te. The findings of the department as to the facts shall be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.\n      f. All such proceedings shall be heard and determined by the court and by any appellate court as expeditiously as possible.  The jurisdiction of the supreme court shall be exclusive and its judgment and order shall be final, subject to review by the appellate division of the supreme court and the court of appeals in the same manner and form and with the same effect as provided for appeals from a judgment in a special proceeding.\n      g. The department's copy of the testimony shall be available at all reasonable times to all parties for examination without cost and for the purposes of judicial review of the order of the commission. The appeal shall be heard on the record without requirement of printing.\n      h. A proceeding under this section must be instituted within thirty days after the service of the order of the department.\n      �20-773  Maintenance and availability of complaint information.  The commissioner shall maintain for each registrant, and shall make available to the public in response to inquiries, complaint information,  in the same manner as complaint information on licensees licensed pursuant to chapter two of title twenty of this code, is maintained and made available.\n      �20-774  Transferability.  No certificate of registration issued under this subchapter shall be transferred or assigned to any person or used by any person other than the registrant to whom it was issued.\n\t�20-775  Violations, penalties.  a.  Any person who violates any of the provisions of this subchapter or any of the rules promulgated hereunder shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not less than three hundred dollars nor more than two thousand dollars or up to one year imprisonment or both.
