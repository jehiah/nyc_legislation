This chapter may be cited as the \"New York city public employee organization reporting law.\"\n\t� 12-402 Statement of policy.\n\tThe council finds that the relations between the city and public employee organizations and the numerous employees they represent have a substantial impact on the economic health of the city, and that it is essential that such public employee organizations and their officials adhere to the highest standards of responsibility and ethical conduct in administering the affairs of their organizations. The council further finds, from recent investigations in the labor and management fields, that there have been a number of instances of breach of trust, corruption, disregard of the rights of individual employees, and other failures to observe high standards of responsibility and ethical conduct, which ethical conduct, which require further and supplementary legislation that will afford necessary protection of the rights and interests of public employees generally as they relate to the activities of public employee organizations, labor relations consultants, and their officers and representatives. Such legislation has established in federal law for forty years with respect to private sector and federal employee unions, and thus this local law would appropriately provide analogous protection with respect to our municipal unions.\n\t� 12-403. Definitions.\n\ta. The term \"public employee organization\" shall have the same meaning as that term is defined in subdivision j of section 12-303 of this title, and shall include any union, chapter, local, division, council, association, or committee affiliated with such organization.\n\tb.

The term \"officer, agent, shop steward, delegate, alternate delegate or other representative,\" when used with respect to a public employee organization, shall include elected officials and key administrative personnel, whether elected or appointed, such as business agents, heads of departments or major units, and organizers who exercise substantial independent authority, but shall not include salaried nonsupervisory professional staff, stenographic, and service personnel.\n\th. The term \"fiscal year\" shall mean the calendar year or other period of twelve consecutive calendar months, on the basis of which financial accounts of the public employee organization officer or employee are kept. Where a public employee organization officer or employee designates a new fiscal year period prior to, the expiration of a previously established fiscal year period, the resultant period of less than twelve consecutive calendar months, and thereafter the newly established fiscal year, shall in that order constitute the fiscal year for purposes of the reports required to be filed by this chapter.\n\tI.

A general exculpatory provision in the constitution and bylaws of such a public employee organization or a general exculpatory resolution of a governing body purporting to relieve any such person of liability for breach of the duties declared by this section shall be void as against public policy.\n\tb.
