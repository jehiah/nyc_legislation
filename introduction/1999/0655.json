  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection 1.  Section 19-162 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law 104 of 1993, is amended by adding thereto a new paragraph 3 to read as follows:\n\t3. (a) Notwithstanding any rule of the department prohibiting double parking in residentially-zoned districts, when parking restrictions are in effect for purposes of street cleaning, it shall be permissible to double park a vehicle on a street or roadway on the side opposite from that which is being cleaned.\n\t(b)  The operator of a double parked vehicle shall be required to conspicuously post inside the vehicle the name, address and phone number where an operator of that vehicle can be reached by the operator of a lawfully parked vehicle blocked by the double parked vehicle.  The failure by the operator of a double parked vehicle to post the required information, shall be a violation of this section.  A violation of this section shall be punishable by the monetary fine authorized for a violation of the rules of the commissioner in accordance with paragraph one of subdivision a of section twenty nine hundred and three of the charter of the city of New York and the vehicle may be removed in accordance with section 19-169 of the code.\n\t(c)  The operator of the double parked vehicle shall be required to move the vehicle within ten minutes of notification by the operator of a lawfully parked vehicle blocked by the double parked vehicle.  If the operator fails to move the double parked vehicle within ten minutes of notification, such failure shall be a violation of this section of the code and shall be punishable by the monetary fine authorized for a violation of the rules of the commissioner in accordance with paragraph one of subdivision a of section twenty nine hundred and three of the charter of the city of New York and the operator of a parked vehicle that is blocked by a double parked vehicle may arrange for the removal of any such unlawfully parked vehicle in accordance with section 19-169 of the code.\n\t�2.  The title of section 19-169 of the administrative code of the city of New York and subdivisions a and b and subparagraphs 1 and 10 of subdivision c of such section, as amended by local law 104 of 1993, are amended to read as follows:\n\t�19-169  Removal of vehicles parked in front of a private driveway and double-parked vehicles blocking lawfully parked vehicles.\n\ta.  Subject to the provisions of this section an owner of a lot containing no more than two dwelling units, or his or her lessee, may cause any vehicle which is parked in front of his or her private driveway and which blocks the entry or egress of a vehicle from such property to be removed and the operator of a lawfully parked vehicle may cause any vehicle which is double parked and which blocks the operator from moving his or her vehicle to be removed by a person licensed to engage in towing pursuant to subchapter thirty-one of chapter two of title twenty of the code, where a person authorized to issue a notice of parking violation has issued such a notice of parking violation and affixed it to such unlawfully parked vehicle; the issuance of such notice shall constitute authorization to the owner of such property, or his or her lessee, or the operator of a lawfully parked vehicle blocked by such double-parked vehicle, to arrange for removal of such unlawfully parked vehicle, and such removal shall be deemed to be at the request of the person who issued the notice.\n\tb.  Where the owner of such property, or his or her lessee, or the operator of a lawfully parked vehicle blocked by a double parked vehicle, requests a police officer to arrange for the removal of any such unlawfully parked vehicle, such vehicle shall be removed at the direction of the police department by the next available towing company participating in the rotation tow program established pursuant to section 20-519 of the code.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude an owner of such property, or his or her lessee, or the operator of a lawfully parked vehicle blocked by a double parked vehicle, acting pursuant to this section, from arranging for the removal of such unlawfully parked vehicle by a tow operator of such person's choice. The commissioner of consumer affairs shall promulgate [a regulation] rules  establishing performance standards for licensees in order to insure that vehicles summonsed under this section are towed as expeditiously as possible.\n\tc.  1.  No vehicle may be removed pursuant to this section without the express written authorization issued to a person licensed to engage in towing pursuant to subchapter thirty-one of chapter two of title twenty of the code by the owner of such property, or his or her lessee, or the operator of a vehicle lawfully parked at the curb.  Such authorization shall include the location of the vehicle to be removed, the make, model, color and license plate number of such vehicle and a statement that such vehicle was removed pursuant to a notice of a parking violation and shall be signed by the owner of such property, or his or her lessee, or the operator of a vehicle lawfully parked at the curb, prior to removal.\n\t10.  When an owner of property, or his or her lessee, or the operator of a vehicle lawfully parked at the curb, improperly causes a vehicle to be removed, such person shall be liable to the owner or other person in control of the vehicle for the cost of removal, transportation and storage and for any damage resulting from the removal, transportation and storage of the vehicle.\n\t�3.
