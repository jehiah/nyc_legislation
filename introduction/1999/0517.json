  "Text": "Be it enacted by, the Council as follows:\n\tSection 1. Legislative Findings. The City Council hereby finds that New York City is experiencing a serious overpopulation of unwanted dogs and cats. This is a matter of serious concern affecting the public health, safety and welfare. The Center for Animal Care and Control, which operates public animal shelters under contract with the City's Department of Health, estimates that 67,000 unwanted, stray or abandoned dogs and cats entered its facilities last year. Of these animals, approximately seventy percent were not neutered. While wandering the City's streets, homeless dogs and cats reproduce at alarming rates, exacerbating a potentially unhealthy and dangerous situation. Dog packs have formed in some areas, increasing numbers of animals are at risk for rabies, and many become the victims of vehicular accidents. These animals also suffer from lack of food and water and exposure to the elements. Given the large and growing number of unwanted dogs and cats, the Council finds that this law is necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of New York City residents.\n\t� 2. Chapter 3 of title 17 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new subchapter 6-a, to read as follows:\nSubchapter 6-a\nSpaying and Neutering of Lost, Strayed or Homeless Animals\n� 17-355 Spaying and neutering required.\n\t� 17-355 Spaying and neutering required. No shelter for homeless animals licensed pursuant to subdivision (b) of section 161.09 of the New York city health code shall release a dog or cat to a person claiming ownership thereof or to a person adopting such dog or cat, unless such dog or cat has been spayed or neutered. Provided, however, that such requirement shall not apply: (i) if a licensed veterinarian certifies to such shelter that he or she has examined such dog or cat and found that because of old age or other reason, the life of such dog or cat would be endangered by spaying or neutering; or (ii) in the case of a dog, if such dog, within the time period provided for by law, is claimed by a person claiming ownership thereof, and such person demonstrates to the satisfaction of such shelter that such dog has an american kennel club or united kennel club breed ring show record dated no more than twelve months prior to the date such dog entered such shelter.\n\t� 3. This local law shall take effect ninety days after its enactment.\n\n\n\n\n\n_______\nNote: Matter in italics is new; matter in brackets [ ] to be omitted.",
