  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection 1.   The New York city charter is amended by adding a new chapter 32 to read as follows:\nChapter 32\nOrganized Crime Control Commission\n\t�771.  Declaration of intent.  For many decades, organized crime has exerted a corrupting and destructive influence on certain sectors of the economy of the city of New York.  For example, organized crime activities have pervaded the public wholesale food markets, the private garbage carting industry and the gambling industry.  That influence can be diminished and ultimately eliminated through sustained law enforcement efforts and regulatory programs aimed at removing organized crime from these areas of the city's economic life.  Therefore, in pursuit of the goal of eliminating organized crime, it is necessary and appropriate to centralize and coordinate certain city programs in a single authority.\n\t�772.  Commission.  There shall be an organized crime control commission, which shall be comprised of a full-time chairperson appointed by the mayor and of the commissioners of the department of business services, the department of consumer affairs, the department of investigation, the police department and the department of sanitation, or their designees.  The commission shall have a staff, serving under the direction of the chairperson, which may include investigators, auditors, attorneys, members of the New York city police department and such other personnel as may be appropriate to accomplish the commission's tasks.\n \t�773.  Jurisdiction and authority.  a.  Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of the administrative code, the commission shall have all of the jurisdiction and authority conferred on (i) the department of business services and the department of investigation pursuant to chapters one-A and one-B of title twenty-two of the administrative code and local law number 50 for the year 1995, local law number 28 for the year 1997 and local law number 27 for the year 1998, relating to the Fulton fish market, other seafood distribution areas and other public wholesale markets, (ii) the New York city trade waste commission pursuant to chapter one of title sixteen-A of the administrative code and local law number 42 for the year 1996, relating to commercial waste removal and (iii) the New York city gambling control commission pursuant to chapter one of title twenty-A of the administrative code and local law number 57 for the year 1997, relating to the regulation of shipboard gambling.\n\tb.\tThe commission shall have such other jurisdiction and authority as shall be conferred upon the commission by local law.\n\t�774.  Powers.  The commission shall have the full range of investigative and regulatory powers available to the city of New York and within its jurisdiction and authority, including, without limitation, the power to issue subpoenas for documents and for testimony, the power to compel the attendance of persons to produce documents and to give testimony under oath, and the power to promulgate rules.\n\t�775.  Cooperation with other agencies.  The commission shall provide such assistance to the mayor and other agencies as requested and shall establish liaison and information-sharing arrangements with other law enforcement, prosecutorial, investigative and regulatory agencies as it deems appropriate.\n\t�2.\tThis local law shall take effect on the sixtieth day after it shall have become a law.\n1\n\n\n2",
