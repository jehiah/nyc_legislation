  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows: \n\n\tSection 1. Legislative findings and intent. The council finds that food vendors,  general vendors and graphic material vendors play an important role in the economic cultural and social life of New York City by providing a livelihood for many New Yorkers and by making available meals, snacks, merchandise and literary and artistic material that are relatively inexpensive and may be purchased quickly. It is also found that street vending activities present to the City an opportunity to obtain significant revenues from the income and business taxes generated by the vendors and other related businesses, such as suppliers of the food and, merchandise and graphic material sold. Consequently, it is important that the system by which vendors are authorized to conduct their businesses, and the methods by which these businesses are operated, assures fairness to consumers and effectively protects their health, is fair to the vendors and respects the concerns of other merchants. One mechanism for achieving the latter is altering the licensing and permitting structure to allocate vending designated locations.\nHowever, the council remains aware that street vending is never appropriate on certain City thoroughfares and is inappropriate during certain days and times of day on other streets. Any scheme for the regulation of street vendors must also accommodate these concerns but must at the same time not allow restrictions of this nature, and the method of establishing those restrictions, to be used as a mechanism for sanitizing the cityscape.\n\t�2. Section 17-306 of the administrative code of the city of New York, is amended by amending subdivision i and by adding thereto new subdivisions q, r and s to read as follows:\n\ti. \"Person\". A natural person, partnership, corporation or other [association] business entity.\n\tq. \"Blockface\".  The area of a sidewalk on each side of a street spanning from one corner to the next.\n\tr.  \"Corner\". That portion of a sidewalk bounded by a line running ten linear feet along each street curb from the point at which two street curbs intersect and the lines extending perpendicular from the end of each such line to the adjacent building line. \n\ts. \"Warrant\".  An authorization to vend at a designated location during a specified time period.\n\t�3. Paragraph 1, paragraph 2 and subparagraphs a and b of paragraph 3 of subdivision b of section 17-307 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 15 for the year 1995 and subparagraph c of paragraph 3 of subdivision b of section 17-307, as amended by local law number 27 for the year 1997, are amended to read as follows:\n\n1.  It shall be unlawful to vend food from any vehicle or pushcart in a public space without having first obtained a permit for such vehicle or pushcart from the commissioner in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter and a warrant in accordance with the provisions of chapter six of title twenty of this code. [The commissioner shall establish standards relating to the size and design of such vehicles and pushcarts. No vendors shall vend from any vehicle or pushcart which does not comply with the standards established by the commissioner.] No vendor shall vend from other than a vehicle or pushcart.          \n\t2. (a)  On and after [July thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty-three] March twenty-fourth, nineteen hundred ninety-eight, [no new full-term] permits shall be issued until the number of such permits which are in effect is [less than] three thousand.

Thereafter, the number of permits shall be reduced as permits that were issued are not renewed. Notwithstanding the limitations on the issuance of new [full-term] permits, a permit issued prior to [July thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty-three] March twenty-fourth, nineteen hundred ninety-eight which is in effect shall be renewable by the licensee to whom the permit was issued subject to the provisions of subparagraph (f) of this paragraph and provided that all other requirements for renewal under the provisions of this subchapter and any rules promulgated pursuant thereto are complied with, the license of the person to whom the permit was issued or the permit has not been revoked or suspended and the licensee has not committed a violation or violations which could be a basis for permit or license revocation or suspension.\n\t(b)(i) On and after March [fifteenth, nineteen hundred ninety-five] twenty-fourth, nineteen hundred ninety-eight, without increasing the number of [full-term] permits which may be in effect in accordance with subparagraph (a) of this paragraph, two hundred [full-term] permits shall be designated for use exclusively in specified boroughs as follows:\n\t(A) fifty of such [full-term] permits shall authorize the holders thereof to vend food from any vehicle or pushcart in any public place in the borough of the Bronx where food vendors are not prohibited from vending;\n\t(B) fifty of such [full-term] permits shall authorize the holders thereof to vend food from any vehicle or pushcart in any public place in the borough of Brooklyn where food vendors are not prohibited from vending;\n\t(C) fifty of such [full-term] permits shall authorize the holders thereof to vend food from any vehicle or pushcart in any public place in the borough of Queens where food vendors are not prohibited from vending; and\n\t(D) fifty of such [full-term] permits shall authorize the holders thereof to vend food from any vehicle or pushcart in any public place in the borough of Staten Island where food vendors are not prohibited from vending.\n\t(ii) After the initial issuance of such permits, the commissioner shall establish a separate waiting list for each of the relevant boroughs to be administered in accordance with procedures to be established by rules of the commissioner.

Except as otherwise provided in item (B) of clause (ii) of subparagraph (a) of paragraph three of subdivision f of this section, no person shall be issued more than one permit [, whether full-term or temporary].\n\t(d) The issuance or renewal of a [full-term] permit pursuant to this subchapter shall be subject to the permittee within three months after the certification of a complete application therefor presenting a pushcart or vehicle for inspection by the department and [within six months after such certification,] passing such inspection.\n\t(e) The commissioner shall establish a separate waiting list for the issuance of [full-term] permits pursuant to this subchapter to be administered in accordance with requirements to be established by rules of the commissioner.  The commissioner may by rule limit the number of places on such waiting list.\n\t(f) Except as otherwise provided in item (B) of clause (ii) of subparagraph (a) of paragraph three of subdivision f of this section, on and after [January first, nineteen hundred ninety-six] March twenty-fourth, nineteen hundred ninety-eight, and on every renewal date thereafter, a permit holder may not renew more than one permit [whether full-time or temporary].

A transfer in violation of this section shall be deemed to have occurred where, if a corporation is the permittee, there has been a change in fifty percent or more of the ownership interest in such corporation from the ownership interest existing on the date the permit was issued, or where the permittee is a limited liability company, where there has been the addition of any member, and where the permittee is a partnership, where there has been the addition of any partner. Furthermore, any such transfer in an exclusive distributor or a manufacturer who has been issued more than one [temporary] permit pursuant to item (B) of clause (ii) of subparagraph (a) of paragraph three of subdivision f of section 17-307 of this subchapter shall result in the automatic revocation of all such additional [temporary] permits issued to such persons pursuant to such provision.\n\t2. an exclusive distributor or a manufacturer who has been issued more than one [temporary] permit pursuant to item (B) of clause (ii) of subparagraph (a) of paragraph three of subdivision f of section 17-307 of this subchapter may lease a vehicle or pushcart owned by such exclusive distributor or manufacturer with such exclusive distributor's or manufacturer's [temporary] permit attached thereto to a person licensed as a food vendor pursuant to this subchapter if (a) such exclusive distributor or manufacturer files with the department the bill of sale or other proof of ownership for such vehicle or pushcart with a duly issued sales tax receipt attached thereto; b) such lease agreement sets forth the food product which may be primarily sold using such vehicle or pushcart; and (c) such lease agreement is approved by the department, provided, however, that if such lease agreement is not approved or disapproved within thirty calendar days after such lease agreement is filed with the department, such lease agreement shall be deemed to be approved by the department.  The commissioner shall promulgate rules establishing the standards by which the department shall evaluate such lease agreements and such standards shall include, but not be limited to, requirements that such lease agreements contain fair and reasonable terms based upon such factors as the cost of purchasing and maintaining such pushcart or vehicle and that the terms of such lease agreement are the result of an arm's length negotiation between the parties thereto.

It shall be unlawful for any person to conduct a food vending business, general vending business or graphic material vending business at any location without first obtaining a warrant to vend at such location. Only the holder of both a license and, when required, a permit may receive a warrant, except where the permittee is a partnership, corporation, limited liability company or other association in which case the permittee shall be eligible to receive a warrant with a license issued to an officer, director, or shareholder of the corporation or, in the case of a partnership, to a partner thereof, with the further exception that a graphic vendor person may receive a warrant to conduct a graphic material vending business without also holding obtaining a license or permit. No more than two vendors may lawfully vend on any corner at any one time nor may more than three vendors lawfully vend at any intersection at any one time but a vendor may lawfully vend on a blockface for which a warrant may be issued by the commissioner. The commissioner shall issue a warrant in accordance with the procedures set forth in this subchapter for every location where vending is authorized by law for the hours during which vending is authorized and may issue more than two warrants for any location or three warrants for any intersection so long as the restrictions set forth in this subdivision are maintained. \n\tb.  No vendor shall be issued more than one warrant except an exclusive distributor or manufacturer, as defined in subdivisions o and p of section 17-306 of this code, respectively, that has been issued multiple food vending permits pursuant to section 17-307 of this code. An exclusive manufacturer or distributor shall be issued warrants equal in number to the number of food vending permits held by such exclusive manufacturer or distributor. \n\tc. Warrants shall be issued in such a manner as to ensure that no category of vendor dominates or is excluded from any geographic area. \n\td.

In such a case, upon request of the vendor, the commissioner shall make every reasonable effort to accommodate the vendor at the nearest available warrantable location or other available warrantable location of the vendor's choice.\n\tf.  Where a location for which a warrant  has been issued may no longer be used to conduct a vending business in accordance with the provisions of such warrant, the department shall mail within five business days of such change to the holder of a warrant for such location written notice revoking the warrant.

The commissioner may, in exercise of his or her discretion, deny the issuance of a warrant for an otherwise warrantable location if in his or her determination, and as explained in a written notification to the applicant, public health, safety or welfare require such action.  In such a case, the commissioner shall make every reasonable effort to accommodate the vendor at the nearest available warrantable location or other available warrantable location of the vendor's choice.\n\t�20-474.5 Procedure for issuance of warrants.  a.

An applicant may submit first and second choices of locations for which a warrant is sought and where only one applicant has sought a warrant for a specific location and/or for a specific time period for a location, a warrant shall be issued forthwith in accordance with such application.\n\t(ii) Where more than one application for a warrant has been received for a specific location and/or for a specific time period for a location, the commissioner shall employ a random selection process for issuing the warrant. Where an applicant is not issued a warrant for a first choice through such random selection process but has submitted a second choice, such second choice shall be deemed a first choice for the purposes of this subdivision and the commissioner shall issue warrants accordingly. Where necessary, the commissioner shall also employ a random selection process for issuing warrants for locations which were the second choices of vendors. The commissioner shall send a written notice by regular mail to those applicants who are not issued a warrant pursuant to this paragraph. \n\t(iii) An applicant who is not issued a warrant pursuant to paragraph ii of this subdivision shall have ten business days from the conclusion of the procedure described in paragraph ii of this subdivision to submit a second application for a warrant in which the applicant may present a first and second choice for any location and/or time period for which no warrant has yet been issued. The issuance of warrants pursuant to this paragraph shall be in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph ii of this subdivision.\n\t(iv) At any time thereafter, a vendor described in subdivision a of this section may submit an application for a warrant for any location and/or time period for which no warrant has been issued. \n\tc.

Proof that the vehicle, pushcart or stand has been inspected by the department authorized to conduct such inspection and passed such inspection. \n\tc. Upon approval of the application, and in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, the commissioner shall issue a warrant plate to the applicant. Such warrant shall contain the name and address of the warrantee, a description of his or her designated location and designated vending hours, his or her permit number, a description of the food, goods or services to be vended at such fixed location, a non-removable photograph of such warrantee and the department's telephone complaint number.\n\t�20-474.7  Design and standards for pushcarts and stands.  a.  The commissioner, in consultation with the commissioner of health, the art commission and a representative from the vending industry, shall by rule adopt generic designs and establish standards relating to the size and configuration of pushcarts and stands.  A unanimous vote of the commissioner of consumer affairs, the commissioner, the art commission, and the vendor representative must be obtained in order to modify any previously existing standard or design, or establish a design or standard where there is none. Unless or until any new standard or design is approved in accordance with this subdivision there shall be no specific standards or design. Any new design and standards shall be published in the City Record and a copy shall be sent to each warrant holder.\n\tb.  No vendor shall vend from any pushcart or stand which does not comply with the standards established in accordance with this section, except that a vendor who holds a permit on the date that a new design or standard is published in the City Record shall have two years from the date of publication within which to comply with that new design or standard.\n\tc.  Any vendor who is unable to comply with the approved standards or design for a pushcart or stand may be granted a waiver from compliance with such standards or design by the commissioner of consumer affairs upon the presentation by the vendor of sufficient evidence of hardship. An application for a waiver shall be approved, approved with conditions or denied by the commissioner within two weeks of its submission. \n\t�20-474.8  Penalties. a. Any holder of a warrant issued pursuant to the provisions of this chapter who in the aggregate commits two or more violations of the provisions of subdivision a of section 20-474.4 of this subchapter, any restriction set forth in section 17-315 of this code or section 20-465 of this chapter, or any rules promulgated thereunder, within a one year period shall be subject to the revocation of the warrant which was the subject of the violations.\n\tb.

This local law shall take effect thirty days after its enactment into la w but the commissioners of health and consumer affairs shall forthwith commence all actions necessary for the implementation of this local law, including the promulgation of rules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJH/JJ/ts\nH:\\lsreques\\VendFinal\n2/10/99 9:30 am",

Legislative findings and intent. The council finds that food vendors,  general vendors and graphic material vendors play an important role in the economic cultural and social life of New York City by providing a livelihood for many New Yorkers and by making available meals, snacks, merchandise and literary and artistic material that are relatively inexpensive and may be purchased quickly. It is also found that street vending activities present to the City an opportunity to obtain significant revenues from the income and business taxes generated by the vendors and other related businesses, such as suppliers of the food and, merchandise and graphic material sold. Consequently, it is important that the system by which vendors are authorized to conduct their businesses, and the methods by which these businesses are operated, assures fairness to consumers and effectively protects their health, is fair to the vendors and respects the concerns of other merchants. One mechanism for achieving the latter is altering the licensing and permitting structure to allocate vending designated locations.\\par\nHowever, the council remains aware that street vending is never appropriate on certain City thoroughfares and is inappropriate during certain days and times of day on other streets. Any scheme for the regulation of street vendors must also accommodate these concerns but must at the same time not allow restrictions of this nature, and the method of establishing those restrictions, to be used as a mechanism for sanitizing the cityscape.\\par\n\\tab\\'a72.
