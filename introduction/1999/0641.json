  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection 1. Declaration of Legislative Intent and Findings. The Council finds that employees working for the fire department of the city of New York (\"FDNY\") as emergency medical technicians (\"EMT's\"), advanced emergency medical technicians (\"paramedics\") and the supervisors of EMT's or paramedics have certain terms and conditions of employment similar to those of the uniformed services of the city of New York, including police, fire, sanitation and correction services. These terms and conditions of employment raise issues, which are materially different than the issues affecting non-uniformed city employees. Furthermore, the Council recognizes that uniformed forces in the police, fire, sanitation and correction departments have certain unique bargaining rights under the New York City Collective Bargaining Law. The Council intends by this amendment to the administrative code that those individuals employed by the FDNY as EMT's, paramedics and supervisors of EMT's or paramedics be accorded the same unique bargaining rights as the uniformed forces of the City. \n\t�2. Paragraph (4) of subdivision a of section 12-307 of the Administrative Code of the city of New York is hereby amended to read as follows:\n\t(4) all matters, including but not limited to pensions, overtime and time and leave rules which affect employees in the uniformed police, fire, sanitation and correction services, or any other police officer as defined in subdivision thirty-four of section 1.20 of the criminal procedure law who is also defined as a police officer in this code, shall be negotiated with the certified employee organizations representing the employees involved. For purposes of this paragraph only, employees of the uniformed fire service shall also include persons employed by the fire department of the city of New York as emergency medical technicians and advanced emergency medical technicians, as those terms are defined in section three thousand one of the public health law, and supervisors of emergency medical technicians or advanced emergency medical technicians; \n\t�3. This local law shall take effect immediately.\n\n\n\n\n\n_______\nNote: Matter in italics is new; matter in brackets [ ] to be omitted.",

Declaration of Legislative Intent and Findings. The Council finds that employees working for the fire department of the city of New York (\"FDNY\") as emergency medical technicians (\"EMT's\"), advanced emergency medical technicians (\"paramedics\") and the supervisors of EMT's or paramedics have certain terms and conditions of employment similar to those of the uniformed services of the city of New York, including police, fire, sanitation and correction services. These terms and conditions of employment raise issues, which are materially different than the issues affecting non-uniformed city employees. Furthermore, the Council recognizes that uniformed forces in the police, fire, sanitation and correction departments have certain unique bargaining rights under the New York City Collective Bargaining Law. The Council intends by this amendment to the administrative code that those individuals employed by the FDNY as EMT's, paramedics and supervisors of EMT's or paramedics be accorded the same unique bargaining rights as the uniformed forces of the City. \\par\n\\tab\\'a72. Paragraph (4) of subdivision a of section 12-307 of the Administrative Code of the city of New York is hereby amended to read as follows:\\par\n\\tab (4) all matters, including but not limited to pensions, overtime and time and leave rules which affect employees in the uniformed police, fire, sanitation and correction services, or any other police officer as defined in subdivision thirty-four of section 1.20 of the criminal procedure law who is also defined as a police officer in this code, shall be negotiated with the certified employee organizations representing the employees involved\\i . For purposes of this paragraph only, employees of the uniformed fire service shall also include persons employed by the fire department of the city of New York as emergency medical technicians and advanced emergency medical technicians, as those terms are defined in section three thousand one of the public health law, and supervisors of emergency medical technicians or advanced emergency medical technicians;\\i0  \\par\n\\tab\\'a73.
