Section 24-163 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\n\tï¿½24-163 Operation of motor vehicle; idling of engine restricted. (a) [No] Definitions.

Processing device shall also mean a device necessary to accomplish the work, other than transporting goods, for which the vehicle or equipment was designed, including, but not limited to: operating a lift, crane, pump, drill, hoist, mixer or other auxiliary equipment other than a heater or air conditioner.\n\t(5) \"School bus depot\" means any garage, lot or other facility where buses that transport children to or from schools are parked overnight.\n\t(6) \"Multiple use bus terminal point\" means a location that is both a terminal point of at least one bus route, other than a school bus route, and at least one bus stop, other than a school bus stop, on a different bus route.\n\t(b) (1) Except as provided in this subdivision or subdivisions (f) or (g) of this section, no person shall cause or permit the engine of a motor vehicle, other than a legally authorized emergency motor vehicle, to idle for longer than three minutes, [except as provided in subdivision (f) of this section,] while parking as defined in section one hundred twenty-nine of the vehicle and traffic law, standing as defined in section one hundred forty-five of the vehicle and traffic law, or stopping as defined in section one hundred forty-seven of the vehicle and traffic law, unless the engine is being used to actively operate a loading[,] and unloading device or processing device. [When the ambient temperature is in excess of forty degrees Fahrenheit, no person shall cause or permit the engine of a bus as defined in section one hundred four of the vehicle and traffic law to idle while parking, standing, or stopping (as defined above) at any terminal point, whether or not enclosed, along an established route. \n\t(b)] (2) The prohibitions of this section shall not apply when a hybrid electric vehicle, as defined in section 86.1702-99 of title forty of the code of federal regulations, is idling for the purpose of providing energy for a battery or other form of energy storage recharging. \n\t(3) The prohibitions of this section shall not apply to electric powered vehicles. \n\t(4) Buses are permitted to idle for five minutes in any thirty minute period in order to operate heating or air conditioning during active loading and unloading of passengers.

It shall be an affirmative defense that any such school was not easily identifiable as a school by signage or otherwise at the time a violation of this subdivision occurred.\n\t(g) Service vehicles operated by a gas or electric company or by a city or state agency or the port authority of New York and New Jersey are permitted to idle in order to operate traffic control signals during street work. \n\t(h) A report shall be submitted to the city council on an annual basis by: (1) the environmental control board that states the number of notices of violation issued for engine idling violations returnable to the environmental control board, including the total amount of penalties imposed for such notices of violations; and (2) the department of finance that states the number of summonses issued for engine idling violations pursuant to subdivision (p) of section 4-08 of title 34 of the rules of the city of New York, or any successor rule, including the total amount of penalties imposed for such summonses.\n\tï¿½ 2.
