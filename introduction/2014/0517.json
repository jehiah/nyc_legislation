  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to provide every student at every college in the City with information about services regarding sexual assault, including how to contact rape crisis centers, hospitals with forensic examiner programs, and telephone help lines.  It would require DOHMH to provide all students with an online tool with functionality for reporting sexual assaults and where they have occurred.  It would require the DOHMH to develop a sexual assault prevention and response curriculum that would include training in affirmative consent and on-campus adjudications for students, faculty, campus safety officers and college administrators.  Lastly, it would require DOHMH to establish a task force including representatives from certain City agencies to work with students and representatives of the faculty and administration from colleges and universities in the City to identify ways to improve City services and agency responses to college sexual assaults.",
