  "Summary": "This bill would amend the requirements for gas station road signs that advertise the price of gasoline to consumers. The bill would require gas stations that sell gasoline at a lower price for purchases made in cash or other specific form of payment to clearly disclose that the advertised price is available only for purchases made in cash or such other specific forms of payment. The bill would also set a minimum size for gas station road signs.",
