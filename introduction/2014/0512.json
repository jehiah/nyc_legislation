  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n      \tSection 1.  Chapter five of title 19 of the administrative code of the city of New York section is amended by adding a new section 19-543 to read as follows: \n      \t� 19-543 Drug and alcohol testing. a. Where a driver licensed by the commission has been involved in a crash where critical injury or death resulted to one or more persons, the commission shall require such driver to submit to alcohol or drug testing as soon as practicable following such crash. For purposes of this section, \"critical injury\" shall mean any injury determined to be critical by the emergency medical service personnel responding to such crash.\n\tb. The commission shall install an interlock ignition device in a vehicle operated by a commission licensed driver if such driver has been reinstated following a suspension or revocation under sections 19-507.1 or 19-507.2 of this chapter. Such interlock ignition device shall be installed for a period of sixty days following such driver's reinstatement from suspension or revocation. For purposes of this section \"interlock ignition device\" shall mean any blood alcohol concentration equivalence measuring device which connects to a motor vehicle ignition system and prevents a motor vehicle from being started without first determining through a deep lung breath sample that the operator's equivalent breath alcohol level does not exceed the calibrated setting on the device as required by section eleven hundred ninety-eight of the vehicle and traffic law. \n   \t� 2. This local law shall take effect one hundred twenty days after its enactment into law, except that the Taxi and Limousine Commission shall take all necessary action, including the promulgation of rules, prior to such effective date.\n\nGZ-ket\n10/1/14 4:37PM\nLS 1820/2014",
