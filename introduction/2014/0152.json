Any building in the City where there has been a final determination of harassment by New York state homes and community renewal (HCR) or any court with jurisdiction five years prior to the enactment date will automatically be denied a CONH should they apply for a permit with DOB. Buildings where a full vacate order has been issued and buildings where there has been active participation in the alternative enforcement program (AEP) will be required to apply for the CONH for covered work. In districts that have undergone city-sponsored neighborhood-wide rezonings and community districts that indicate significant distress based on numerous factors, including changes of ownerships, certain buildings that meet a Building Qualification Index (BQI) will also be required to apply for the CONH for covered work. \r\n\r\nIf harassment is found after an investigation by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) and community groups, where designated by HPD, the owner must provide for affordable housing. Within such building, at least 25% of the total residential floor area of such building must be affordable, and if it is a new building, then 20% of the total floor area of a new building on the lot containing the building must be affordable. One-third of the affordable housing units will be made available at 40 percent of the area median income (AMI), one-third of such units within such building are available at 50 percent of the AMI and one-third of such units are available at 60 percent of the AMI.This law takes effect 270 days after it becomes law, and sunsets after three years.","TextID":60710,"Text":"Int. No. 152-C\n\nBy Council Members Lander, Chin, Johnson, Reynoso, Rosenthal, Mendez, Menchaca, Rose, Williams, King, Levin, Rodriguez, Cornegy, Levine, Torres, Van Bramer, Gibson, Richards and Kallos (by request of the Manhattan Borough President)\n\n..Title\nA Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring a certification of no harassment prior to approval of construction documents or issuance of permits for demolition or renovation of certain buildings\n..Body\n\nBe it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n      Section 1. Legislative findings. The Council has found and is concerned with the association between various characteristics of building distress, and the likelihood of suspected or reported harassment against tenants, and has an interest in finding ways to protect tenants at risk of displacement due to landlord harassment. Current Certification of No Harassment (\"CONH\") requirements apply only to single room occupancy buildings and to all buildings in select special purpose zoning districts under the Zoning Resolution. In general, the program requires an investigation into whether harassment has occurred during a prescribed time period, and is triggered when an owner makes a permit application to the Department of Buildings for a material alteration of a building.  \n      The Council finds that outside of these single room occupancy buildings and the buildings in special zoning districts, buildings with high rates of physical distress or ownership changes are typically associated with suspected or known harassment patterns. Areas targeted for rezoning see an increased rate of change in ownership. The effects of such rezonings stretch beyond the rezoned blocks into surrounding neighborhoods. Because community districts are drawn specifically to capture communities of shared interest, they provide readily administrable boundaries for delineating where a rezoning in one part of a neighborhood is most likely to have effects outside the rezoning area. A limited pilot expansion of the CONH program to include buildings potentially at risk of harassment in particular neighborhoods where buildings with the highest rates of physical distress or ownership changes are located, or in city-sponsored neighborhood wide rezoned areas where heightened protection against harassment is essential to equitable development, would enable the Council to determine if expanding the CONH program could reduce the risk of harassment for tenants in such buildings and provide valuable feedback on its effect on tenant protection and housing conditions. The purpose of this local law is to provide for the implementation of such a program as a geographically targeted and time-limited pilot program to allow an evaluation of the program's accuracy and efficacy in targeting and addressing harassment in particular buildings. \n      The current Administrative Code provisions that apply to single room occupancy multiple dwellings consider incidents of harassment that occurred within three years of an application for development as indicative that such harassment was motivated by the redevelopment. The Council is concerned that redevelopment-motivated harassment may occur even earlier than three years before a redevelopment occurs. Thus, the pilot program proposes to lengthen this period to five years.. The current Administrative Code provisions also require that once a CONH has been denied, no development is allowed at the site for a specified period of time.  The pilot seeks to determine the impact on a legislative CONH program of allowing owners of buildings where a CONH is denied to proceed with development if they  agree to construct floor area of low income housing within the building or within any new building within the same community district, similar to what is allowed under zoning resolution CONH requirements.  In accordance with the Council's goal of equitable development, priority in allocating such units would be given to qualified tenants who resided in the building during the time the acts of harassment occurred. \n      � 2. Article 1 of subchapter 4 of chapter 2 of title 27 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 27-2093.1 to read as follows:\n      � 27-2093.1 Certification of no harassment with respect to pilot program buildings. a.

Nothing contained herein shall preclude an occupant of such pilot program building from applying on his or her own behalf for similar relief.\n      e. Cure agreement. (1) An agreement to cure the record of harassment at a pilot program building shall require the owner to engage in or provide for, through an entity identified by the department as capable of developing new affordable housing in the same community district as the pilot program building, the construction of floor area of low income housing, either within the pilot program building, in a new building at the same site as the pilot program building  or such same community district, in accordance with rules promulgated by the department, provided that such owner shall construct or provide within such building or community district no less than the greater of: (i) 25 percent of the total residential floor area of such pilot program building undergoing covered work in which harassment has occurred, or (ii) 20 percent of the total floor area of any new or pilot program building undergoing covered work on the lot containing the pilot program building subject to such agreement. \n      (2) The owner shall record and index a restrictive declaration with respect to such agreement with the city register or the Richmond county clerk. \n      (3) The department shall promulgate rules providing for the administration and enforcement of such an agreement, and shall establish criteria for such an agreement to ensure the effective implementation thereof.  Such rules shall include a requirement that lawful tenants who resided in the pilot program building  during the 60 month period prior to the determination to deny the certification of no harassment or prior to the rescission of a certification of no harassment shall have priority in the allocation of low income units constructed by the owner within the pilot program building or in a new building at the same site as the pilot program building if they otherwise qualify for such units.\n      (4)  The owner shall attest, as part of such agreement, that no such construction of floor area of low income housing required under paragraph (1) of this subdivision shall be used  by the owner to satisfy an eligibility requirement of any real property tax abatement or exemption program, or of a floor area ratio increase pursuant to section 23-90 of the zoning resolution, for which the owner otherwise may be eligible to apply, or to apply for a hardship waiver from any existing code or zoning resolution requirements.  The department shall ensure that floor area of low income housing required under paragraph (1) of this subdivision is in addition to and not in substitution for floor area of low income housing that may be used by the owner to satisfy an eligibility requirement of any real property tax abatement or exemption program, or of a floor area ratio increase pursuant to section 23-90 of the zoning resolution, for which the owner may apply. The department shall ensure that a city, state or federal subsidy shall not be used for the construction of low income housing required under paragraph (1) of this subdivision.\n      f. Suspension and rescission of a certification. (1) The department may rescind a certification of no harassment that was granted for a pilot program building if it finds that harassment has occurred at such building while such certification was in effect, as described by this subdivision.\n      (2) If the department has reasonable cause to believe that harassment has occurred during the effective period of a certification of no harassment, the commissioner shall suspend the certification of no harassment for the pilot program building. Upon the request of the department, the department of buildings shall not approve any construction documents or issue an initial or reinstated permit in connection with covered categories of work or, if such documents have been approved or such permit has been issued, issue a stop-work notice and order pursuant to section 28-505.6. Notice of such a suspension of a certification of no harassment shall be mailed to the applicant, the owner of record of such pilot program building and known tenants of such building and shall - be filed with the city register or Richmond county clerk.\n      (3) As soon as reasonably possible after a request for a hearing by an owner who has received a notice of suspension, but not later than 30 days after such suspension, the department shall commence a proceeding at the office of administrative trials and hearings by filing the required pleadings. At the hearing, the owner of a pilot program building for which a certification of no harassment has been suspended shall have the opportunity to be heard. Notice of such hearing shall be given to the applicant, such other persons and known tenants of such building in the manner prescribed by the office of administrative trials and hearings. The department may receive testimony from such other persons and known tenants of such building. The department shall determine whether to rescind the certification of no harassment within 45 days of receiving the report and recommendation from the office of administrative trials and hearings.\n      (4) If the owner has been found by New York state homes and community renewal or any court having jurisdiction to have engaged in harassment, unlawful eviction, or arson at the pilot program building after the certification of no harassment was granted, the department may determine whether to rescind such certification without commencing a proceeding at the office of administrative trials and hearings. \n      (5) If the department determines not to rescind such certification of no harassment, the department shall notify the department of buildings of such determination and any stop work notice and order issued by the department of buildings pursuant to section 28-505.6 shall be vacated immediately. Notice of such determination shall be mailed to the owner of record of such pilot program building, the known tenants of such building and filed with the city register or the Richmond county clerk.\n      (6) If the department determines that such certification of no harassment shall be rescinded, notice of such determination accompanied by written findings indicating the grounds for such determination shall be provided to the department of buildings and shall be mailed to the owner of record of such pilot program building and filed with the city register or the Richmond county clerk. Such determination shall be subject to review pursuant to article 78 of the civil practice law and rules.\n      g. For the purpose of any subsequent proceeding with respect to a pilot program building, the granting of a certification of no harassment or a waiver thereof for any period of time shall be conclusive proof only for the purposes of this section that no harassment occurred within the time period covered by such certification or that the waiver of such certification for such time period was appropriate.\n      h. Fees. The department is authorized to establish by rule reasonable fees from applicants for the administrative expenses incurred by the department for issuing the certification of no harassment pursuant to this section, including costs for publication and notices.\n      i. Waiver. The commissioner may grant a waiver of certification of no harassment although the commissioner determines that harassment has occurred at the pilot program building for which such certification is sought during the 60 month period prior to the date of the submission of an application for a certification of no harassment if the commissioner finds that:\n      (1)(A) the owner of record of the pilot program building was the owner of record prior to  November 29, 2017 or had entered into a contract of sale for the purchase of such pilot program building which was recorded prior to such date or, with respect to a certification proceeding where the alterations sought to be performed are of the type prescribed by rule of the commissioner pursuant to item 5 of section 28-505.3, the owner of record of such multiple dwelling was the owner of record of such multiple dwelling prior to the date of the first publication of such rule or had entered into a contract of sale for the purchase of such multiple dwelling which was recorded prior to such date;\n      (B) such owner was not the owner of such multiple dwelling during any period of time in which such harassment occurred and did not at such pilot program building (i) otherwise engage or participate in such harassment; or (ii) with intent that harassment be performed, agree with one or more persons to engage in or cause the performance of harassment; or (iii) with intent that another person engage in conduct constituting harassment, solicit, request, command, importune or otherwise attempt to cause such person to engage in conduct constituting harassment; and\n      (C) such owner acquired title pursuant to a bona fide transaction that is not intended to evade the provisions of this section; or\n      (2) the owner acquired the multiple dwelling by sale pursuant to foreclosure of a mortgage or pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure of a mortgage; provided, however, that such conveyance was a bona fide transaction for the purpose of enforcing the debt and not intended to evade the provisions of this section and either:\n      (i) a certification of no harassment or waiver thereof was granted with respect to such multiple dwelling within a sixty day period prior to the date of the recording of such mortgage and no suspension or rescission thereof was recorded prior to such date; or\n      (ii) such mortgage was recorded prior to November 29, 2017 or, if such owner is a banking organization as defined in section 2 of the banking law, a national banking association, a federal savings and loan association, the mortgage facilities corporation, savings banks life insurance fund, the savings banks retirement system, an authorized insurer as defined in section 4 of the insurance law, or a trust company or other corporation organized under the laws of this state all the capital stock of which is owned by at least 20 savings banks or by at least 20 savings and loan associations or a subsidiary corporation all of the capital stock of which is owned by such trust company or other corporation, a commitment for such mortgage was made prior to such date.\n      (3) In determining whether a transaction described in this subdivision was bona fide, the commissioner may consider whether at such pilot project building or any other multiple dwelling such owner did (i) otherwise engage or participate in harassment; or (ii) with intent that harassment be performed, agree with one or more persons to engage in or cause the performance of harassment; or (iii) with intent that another person engage in conduct constituting harassment, solicit, request, command, importune or otherwise attempt to cause such person to engage in conduct constituting harassment. The commissioner may also consider the relationship between the parties to the transaction.\n      (4) A waiver of a certification pursuant to this subdivision shall state the findings of the commissioner.\n      � 3. Chapter 5 of title 28 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new article 505 to read as follows:\nARTICLE 505\nCERTIFICATION OF NO HARASSMENT PILOT PROGRAM\n\n� 28-505.1 General.

Legislative findings. The Council has found and is concerned with the association between various characteristics of building distress, and the likelihood of suspected or reported harassment against tenants, and has an interest in finding ways to protect tenants at risk of displacement due to landlord harassment. Current Certification of No Harassment (\\ldblquote CONH\\rdblquote ) requirements apply only to single room occupancy buildings and to all buildings in select special purpose zoning districts under the Zoning Resolution. In general, the program requires an investigation into whether harassment has occurred during a prescribed time period, and is triggered when an owner makes a permit application to the Department of Buildings for a material alteration of a building.  \\par\nThe Council finds that outside of these single room occupancy buildings and the buildings in special zoning districts, buildings with high rates of physical distress or ownership changes are typically associated with suspected or known harassment patterns. Areas targeted for rezoning see an increased rate of change in ownership. \\f1 The effects of such rezonings stretch beyond the rezoned blocks into surrounding neighborhoods. Because community districts are drawn specifically to capture communities of shared interest, they provide readily administrable boundaries for delineating where a rezoning in one part of a neighborhood is most likely to have effects outside the rezoning area.\\f0  A limited pilot expansion of the CONH program to include buildings potentially at risk of harassment in particular neighborhoods where buildings with the highest rates of physical distress or ownership changes are located, or in city-sponsored neighborhood wide rezoned areas where heightened protection against harassment is essential to equitable development, would enable the Council to determine if expanding the CONH program could reduce the risk of harassment for tenants in such buildings and provide valuable feedback on its effect on tenant protection and housing conditions. The purpose of this local law is to provide for the implementation of such a program as a geographically targeted and time-limited pilot program to allow an evaluation of the program\\rquote s accuracy and efficacy in targeting and addressing harassment in particular buildings. \\par\nThe current Administrative Code provisions that apply to single room occupancy multiple dwellings consider incidents of harassment that occurred within three years of an application for development as indicative that such harassment was motivated by the redevelopment. The Council is concerned that redevelopment-motivated harassment may occur even earlier than three years before a redevelopment occurs. Thus, the pilot program proposes to lengthen this period to five years.. The current Administrative Code provisions also require that once a CONH has been denied, no development is allowed at the site for a specified period of time.  The pilot seeks to determine the impact on a legislative CONH program of allowing owners of buildings where a CONH is denied to proceed with development if they  agree to construct floor area of low income housing within the building or within any new building within the same community district, similar to what is allowed under zoning resolution CONH requirements.  In accordance with the Council\\rquote s goal of equitable development, priority in allocating such units would be given to qualified tenants who resided in the building during the time the acts of harassment occurred. \\par\n\\'a7 2. \\cf1 Article 1 of subchapter 4 of chapter 2 of title 27 of t\\cf0 he administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 27-2093.1 to read as follows:\\par\n\\ul\\'a7 27-2093.1 Certification of no harassment with respect to pilot program buildings. a.
