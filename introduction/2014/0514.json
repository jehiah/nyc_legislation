  "Summary": "This bill would require the Board of Standards and Appeals to provide a notification to the owner of record when a variance is about to expire. Use of such property after the expiration of such term may be a violation of the certificate of occupancy and such notice would inform the owner that the Board of Standards and Appeals may not approve an application to extend the term of the variance until any penalties for such a violation are paid.",
