Traffic calming measures would be implemented on these roadways as required by New York State Vehicle and Traffic Law Section 1642. Traffic calming measures are defined in Section 1642 as “any physical engineering measure or measures that reduce the negative effects of motor vehicle use, alter driver behavior and improve conditions for non-motorized street users such as pedestrians and bicyclists.”","TextID":55184,"Text":"Int.
