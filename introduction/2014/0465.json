Section 19-113 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new subdivision d to read as follows:\n\td. Department specifications for streets shall limit the amount of Portland cement in concrete mixes requiring a compressive strength of fourteen thousand pounds per square inch or less as follows:\n\t1.  Such mixes when used in roadways that are required to be opened to vehicular traffic within forty-eight hours, or in post-tensioned concrete or structural underpinning, shall contain no more than six hundred and fifty pounds of Portland cement per cubic yard of concrete.\n\t2. Such mixes when used in roadways that are not required to be opened to vehicular traffic within forty-eight hours, or when used in sidewalks and curbs shall contain no more than four hundred pounds of Portland cement per cubic yard of concrete.\n\t3.  This subdivision shall not apply to concrete mixes used in a project where the content of concrete mixes is governed by a federal or state law, rule, regulation, guideline or specification that requires a greater amount of Portland cement per cubic yard of concrete than this subdivision permits.\n\t4.  This subdivision shall not apply to bridges, tunnels and overpasses or structures appurtenant thereto under the jurisdiction of the department.\n\t5.
