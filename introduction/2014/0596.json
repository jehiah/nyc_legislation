  "Summary": "The bill adds a new section 142 to Title 18 of the administrative code mandating that the department study and mitigate the impacts of methane gas emissions on city-owned trees.\r\n\r\nThe bill calls for the Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR), in conjunction with the Department of Environmental Protection, to create or review and adopt maps showing fugitive methane gas emissions from gas mains in the city. Where maps of the canopy of trees under DPR’s jurisdiction, when overlaid upon the maps of methane gas emissions from gas mains, indicate that such trees may be impacted by fugitive methane gas emissions, DPR would have to perform a field survey to determine whether the trees have been damaged by the emissions. Where the field surveys confirm damage to such trees, DPR must document the damage, take appropriate steps to notify the responsible utility and require mitigation or seek reimbursement as may be appropriate.",
