  "Summary": "Int. No. 464 would require the city Department of Correction (DOC) to implement a program to assist eligible jailed individuals to vote by absentee ballot. Specifically, it directs DOC to administer a program that offers absentee ballot applications to eligible individuals and a means to complete the applications. After the applications have been submitted and DOC receives the requested absentee ballots, the agency is to distribute the ballots and provide assistance in completing them upon request. DOC is also required to transmit completed applications and ballots to the New York City Board of Elections, if requested by the applicable inmate.",
