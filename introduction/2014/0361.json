Pursuant to New York State law, the maximum stay at these shelters is 180 days. Domestic violence survivors who still require temporary shelter after 180 days must enter the Department of Homeless Services (DHS) shelter system. Currently, these families must go to DHS’ intake facility for an eligibility assessment prior to being admitted to a DHS shelter.\r\n\r\nThis bill would require DHS to automatically deem domestic violence survivors eligible for shelter if applicants are no longer eligible for HRA domestic violence shelter because they have reached the maximum length of stay, HRA has provided DHS notice of the upcoming exit, which the bill would require HRA to provide, and applicants report to DHS on the day they exit the HRA shelter.","TextID":55108,"Text":"Int.
