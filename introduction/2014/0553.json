  "Summary": "After-school programs are administered through the Department of Youth and Community Development (DYCD). This bill would require DYCD to require that all after-school programs where more than one-third of the students in the school district where the program is located are English-language learners to have bilingual components incorporated into the program. These bilingual components may include but are not limited to bilingual instructors and staff, and activities conducted in all native languages of the students.",
