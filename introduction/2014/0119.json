  "Summary": "The bill would require the Inspector General for the Police Department—working with the Law Department, the Police Department, the Comptroller, the Civilian Complaint Review Board, and Commission to Combat Police Corruption—to review information on police misconduct and develop recommendations related to the disciplining, training, and monitoring of police officers. To facilitate this review, the Law Department would be required to publish information on civil actions every six months. In addition, the Police Department would be required to study determinations by judges that an officer’s testimony at a trial is not credible.",
