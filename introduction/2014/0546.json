  "Summary": "In 2013, the Department of Transportation announced that it would replace all 250,000 streetlights in New York City with energy-efficient light-emitting diode (LED) technology by 2017.\r\n\r\nThis bill would require that any lamp installed as part of the lighting of streets, highways, parks, or any other public place use LED technology, or the best available technology for achieving energy-efficiency, if it is more efficient than LED technology. The bill would also require the Department of Transportation to report to the Council and post on its website, beginning on January 1, 2015, and every six months thereafter: 1) the number of street light-fixtures installed with lamps using LED or other best-available technology, and 2) the number of street light-fixtures that remain to be installed with such technology, with the data disaggregated by borough and Council district.",
