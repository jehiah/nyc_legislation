  "Summary": "The bill would reduce the number of licenses for horses used in the operation of horse-drawn carriages and the number of hours a horse-drawn carriage may operate during a 24-hour period, establish a stable in Central Park, limit the operation of horse-drawn carriages to Central Park, and prohibit the operation of pedicabs below the 85th Street Transverse in Central Park.",
  "TextID": 57266,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      Section 1. Declaration of legislative intent and findings. a. The Council finds and declares that:\n      1. Horse-drawn carriage service was developed for use in the city before automobiles became common, yet horses continue to work on streets alongside taxicabs, private cars, and busses. Numerous traffic crashes involving horse-drawn carriages have occurred in New York City, resulting in harm to horses and damage to vehicles. The presence of horse-drawn carriages on busy streets surrounding stables and Central Park not only negatively impacts the quality of life in these areas, but puts horses in stressful situations and places them in harm's way. \n      2. Limiting the operation of horse-drawn carriages to Central Park will make the \nCity's streets safer for pedestrians, cyclists, and motorists; eliminate the potential for dangerous interactions between horses and vehicles; and allow for the continuation of the horse-drawn carriage industry.  \n      3. Stabling carriage horses within Central Park will allow horse-drawn carriages to provide rides within the Park without requiring horses to work on City streets. \n      4. Moving the horse-drawn carriage industry within Central Park requires both a reduction in the number of licensed horses and in the number of hours per day a carriage may operate. \n      5. As a stable within Central Park will not be operational until October 1, 2018, prohibiting operation of horse-drawn carriages on streets unless they are traveling directly to or from a stable and Central Park will reduce the risk to horses and improve safety on city streets. \n      6. Once horse-drawn carriage operations, including the locations where carriages may wait and allow passengers to board, are moved within Central Park, it will be necessary to limit pedicab operation to areas of the Park north of the 85th Street Transverse in order to achieve an appropriate balance of park uses and interests in a heavily utilized area of the Park. \n      b. The Council finds that it is necessary and appropriate to reduce the number of licenses for horses used in the operation of horse-drawn carriages and the number of hours a horse-drawn carriage may operate during any 24-hour period, establish a stable within Central Park, limit the operation of horse-drawn carriages to Central Park, and prohibit the operation of pedicabs below the 85th Street Transverse in Central Park.\n      ï¿½ 2. Subdivisions d and e of section 17-327 of the administrative code of the city of New York, subdivision d as amended by local law number 22 for the year 2002, are amended and new subdivisions f, g, and h are added to read as follows:\n      d. 1. Application for a license or the renewal of a license shall be made to the department of health and mental hygiene. Such application shall contain the name and address of the owner of the horse and of the owner of the rental horse business in which such horse is to be used if such person is not the owner of the horse, the age, sex, color, markings and any other identifying marks such as brands, microchips or tattoos of the horse, the location of the stable where the horse is to be kept, a certification that the horse will not be sold or otherwise transferred to an individual or organization for purposes of slaughter, resale for slaughter, or holding or transport for slaughter and any other information which the commissioner of health and mental hygiene may require. An application with respect to a horse which is used in the operation of a \"horse drawn cab\" as defined in subchapter twenty-one of chapter two of title twenty of this code shall include the identification number required to be inscribed on such horses hoof and on a microchip which shall be implanted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the department [of consumer affairs]. The application shall be accompanied by the license or renewal fee. \n      2. Until there are no more than 110 licenses for horses used in the operation of horse drawn cabs, the commissioner shall not accept new applications for such licenses and shall not issue any such license if such issuance would result in the total number of such licenses exceeding 110 on December 1, 2016; provided, however, that beginning on the date upon which the commissioner of parks and recreation makes a certification pursuant to subdivision s of section 17-330, until there are no more than 95 licenses for horses used in the operation of horse drawn cabs, the commissioner shall not accept new applications for such licenses and shall not issue any such license if such issuance would result in the total number of such licenses exceeding 95.\n      3. Notwithstanding subdivision b of this section, any license for a horse used in the operation of a horse drawn cab renewed on or after the effective date of the law that added this paragraph and before December 1, 2016 shall expire on December 1, 2016; provided, however, that this paragraph shall not apply to licenses for a horse used in the operation of a horse drawn cab that are identified for renewal pursuant to subdivision f of this section. \n      e. No license shall be transferable. 1. Upon the transfer of ownership of any horse to a new owner, the [new owner shall obtain a license for such horse within fifteen days after the date of the transfer of ownership] former owner shall surrender the license to the commissioner. Such horse shall not be used in the operation of a horse drawn cab until it has been issued a new license for a horse used in the operation of a horse drawn cab pursuant to this subchapter.\n      2. Holders of licenses for horses used in the operation of horse drawn cabs who retain such a license or licenses shall be permitted to substitute or replace a licensed horse that is lame, suffers from a physical condition or other illness making it unsuitable for work, or that retires, with another licensed horse, and maintain the number of licenses for a horse or horses used in the operation of horse drawn cabs that such license holder has been designated under subdivision f or g of this section, provided that such license holder has complied with the requirements of section 17-329.\n      3. Within 30 days of receiving or renewing a license for a horse used in the operation of a horse drawn cab, holders of such a license shall be permitted to replace a licensed horse with another licensed horse for any reason and maintain the number of licenses for a horse or horses used in the operation of horse drawn cabs that such license holder has been designated under subdivision f or g of this section, provided that such license holder has complied with the requirements of section 17-329.\n      f. Prior to December 1, 2016, the department shall identify 110 licenses for horses used in the operation of horse drawn cabs that shall be renewed in the following order, provided that such licenses would otherwise be eligible for renewal pursuant to this section: (1) license holders who have a valid license to operate a horse drawn cab pursuant to subdivision a of section 20-374, provided that such license holder shall be permitted to renew one license for a horse used in the operation of a horse drawn cab; and (2) any remaining licenses for horses used in the operation of horse drawn cabs shall be distributed to license holders who have a valid license to operate a horse drawn cab pursuant to subdivision a of section 20-374, selected by means of a lottery; provided, however that the department may limit such lottery to such license holders who have two or more licenses for horses used in the operation of horse drawn cabs and provided, further, however, that no license holder who has a valid license to operate a horse drawn cab shall be eligible to receive more than two licenses for horses used in the operation of a horse drawn cab.\n      g. Prior to the date the commissioner of parks and recreation makes a certification pursuant to subdivision s of section 17-330, the department shall select by means of a lottery 95 of the licenses for horses used in the operation of horse drawn cabs remaining under subdivision f of this section that shall be eligible for renewal as of the date the commissioner of parks and recreation makes a certification pursuant to subdivision s of section 17-330; provided, however that license holders who have a valid license to operate a horse drawn cab pursuant to subdivision a of section 20-374 shall each be permitted to retain at least one license for a horse used in the operation of a horse drawn cab. \n      h. The commissioner may promulgate such rules and regulations as are necessary to implement the provisions of this section.\n      ï¿½ 3. Subdivision a of section 17-328 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\n      a. Each horse licensed pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter shall be assigned an official identification number by the department. Such identification number shall be branded on the hoof of the horse and included on a microchip implanted in the horse in a manner to be prescribed by the commissioner and shall also be inscribed on a plainly visible metal tag which shall be attached to the bridle of the horse in a conspicuous place to be specified by the commissioner at all times when the horse is at work. Such tag shall be issued to the owner with the certificate of license. The tag and certificate of license shall be of such form and design and shall contain such information as the commissioner shall prescribe. Duplicate tags and certificates of license shall be issued only upon proof of loss of the original and the payment of a fee of two dollars. \n      ï¿½ 4.

The supervision formerly was reposed in the police commissioner, but recent experience and study indicate that jurisdiction over such businesses should be transferred to the commissioner.

Declaration of legislative intent and findings. a. The Council finds and declares that:\\par\n1. Horse-drawn carriage service was developed for use in the city before automobiles became common, yet horses continue to work on streets alongside taxicabs, private cars, and busses. Numerous traffic crashes involving horse-drawn carriages have occurred in New York City, resulting in harm to horses and damage to vehicles. The presence of horse-drawn carriages on busy streets surrounding stables and Central Park not only negatively impacts the quality of life in these areas, but puts horses in stressful situations and places them in harm\\rquote s way. \\par\n2. Limiting the operation of horse-drawn carriages to Central Park will make the \\line City\\rquote s streets safer for pedestrians, cyclists, and motorists; eliminate the potential for dangerous interactions between horses and vehicles; and allow for the continuation of the horse-drawn carriage industry.  \\par\n3. Stabling carriage horses within Central Park will allow horse-drawn carriages to provide rides within the Park without requiring horses to work on City streets. \\par\n4. Moving the horse-drawn carriage industry within Central Park requires both a reduction in the number of licensed horses and in the number of hours per day a carriage may operate. \\par\n5. As a stable within Central Park will not be operational until October 1, 2018, prohibiting operation of horse-drawn carriages on streets unless they are traveling directly to or from a stable and Central Park will reduce the risk to horses and improve safety on city streets. \\par\n6. Once horse-drawn carriage operations, including the locations where carriages may wait and allow passengers to board, are moved within Central Park, it will be necessary to limit pedicab operation to areas of the Park north of the 85\\super th\\nosupersub  Street Transverse in order to achieve an appropriate balance of park uses and interests in a heavily utilized area of the Park. \\par\nb. The Council finds that it is necessary and appropriate to reduce the number of licenses for horses used in the operation of horse-drawn carriages and the number of hours a horse-drawn carriage may operate during any 24-hour period, establish a stable within Central Park, limit the operation of horse-drawn carriages to Central Park, and prohibit the operation of pedicabs below the 85\\super th\\nosupersub  Street Transverse in Central Park.\\par\n\\'a7 2. Subdivisions d and e of section 17-327 of the administrative code of the city of New York, subdivision d as amended by local law number 22 for the year 2002, are amended and new subdivisions f, g, and h are added to read as follows:\\par\nd. \\ul 1.\\ulnone  Application for a license or the renewal of a license shall be made to the department of health and mental hygiene.
