They attract refuse and graffiti, and obstruct pedestrian traffic. Currently, the Department of Sanitation (“DSNY”) is authorized to remove any collection bin placed on City property 30 days after notice has been affixed to the collection bin. Recently, however, the number of collection bins on City property has greatly increased. Collection bin providers have learned they can simply move their collection bin to another location on City property before 30 days has elapsed.\r\n\r\nThe bill would allow DSNY to immediately remove a collection bin placed on City property, or property maintained by the City, or on any public sidewalk or roadway. If the owner’s name and address are located on the collection bin, DSNY will provide notice to the owner that it has removed the bin and that the owner can claim such collection bin through procedures to be established by rule. The bill establishes civil penalties for collection bins placed on City property and for attaching or enclosing a bin on City property. An owner who seeks to reclaim a collection bin that has been removed by DSNY will be required to pay any penalties imposed and the costs of removal and storage. If the owner does not claim his or her collection bin within 30 days, the department can dispose of it. For bins on private property, both the owner of the bin and the owner of the property will be responsible for maintaining the bin in a clean and neat condition and for reporting the amount of material collected on a yearly basis to DSNY.","TextID":54811,"Text":"Int.
