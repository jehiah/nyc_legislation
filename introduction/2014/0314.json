  "Summary": "Currently, Section 14 of the New York City Charter establishes an Office of Veterans Affairs within the mayor’s office. This bill would establish a separate Department of Veterans Affairs (the “Department”), headed by a Commissioner of Veterans Affairs. The bill would provide the Department with the responsibility to cooperate with federal, state, and local agencies and to inform and assist members of the armed forces and veterans, and their families in matters relating to: educational training and retraining services and facilities; health, medical, and rehabilitation services and facilities; provisions of federal, state, and local laws and regulations giving special rights and privileges to members of the armed forces, veterans, and their families; employment and re-employment services; and other appropriate matters.\r\n\r\nThe Office of Veterans Affairs is currently advised by a Veterans Advisory Board comprised of nine members (five appointment by the mayor and four appointed by the speaker of the City Council), all of whom are veterans. This bill requires the Veterans Advisory Board to advise the commissioner on all matters concerning veterans, as well as keeping the requirements that they meet quarterly, keep records of meetings, and submit an annual report of their activities to the mayor and the council on or before December 31 of each year.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this bill amends the New York City Administrative Code to require the Department to publish information on its website concerning resources intended to assist veterans in obtaining employment, and to consult with city agencies to identify job postings for inclusion on the Federal veterans’ job bank. Finally, the bill requires each city agency to designate an employee to act as a liaison with veterans within the agency, and the Department to provide periodic training to the veterans’ liaisons, as well as to post on its website the names of the liaisons at each city agency.",
