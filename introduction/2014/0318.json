Criminal conviction; employment. (a) It shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice for any [person] employer, employment agency or agent thereof to deny [any license or permit or] employment to any person or take adverse action against any employee  by reason of [his or her] such person or employee having been convicted of one or more criminal offenses, or by reason of a finding of a lack of \"good moral character\" which is based on [his or her] such person or employee having been convicted of one or more criminal offenses, when such denial or adverse action is in violation of the provisions of article twenty-three-a of the correction law. \r\n      (b) For purposes of this subdivision, \"employment\" shall not include membership in any law enforcement agency.\r\n      (c) Pursuant to section seven hundred fifty-five of the correction law, the provisions of this subdivision shall be enforceable against public agencies by a proceeding brought pursuant to article seventy-eight of the Civil Practice Law and Rules, and the provisions of this subdivision shall be enforceable against private employers by the commission through the administrative procedure provided for in this chapter or as provided in chapter five of this title. For purposes of this paragraph only, the terms \"public agency\" and \"private employer\" shall have the meaning given such terms in section seven hundred fifty of the correction law.\r\n      11. Arrest record; employment. It shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice, unless specifically required or permitted by any other law, for any person to: \r\n      (a) deny employment to any applicant or act adversely upon any employee by reason of an arrest or criminal accusation of such applicant or employee when such denial or adverse action is in violation of subdivision 16 of section 296 of article 15 of the New York state executive law; or\r\n      (b) make any inquiry [about, whether in any form of application or otherwise, or to act upon adversely to the person involved, any arrest or criminal accusation of such person not then pending against that person which was followed by a termination of that criminal action or proceeding in favor of such person, as defined in subdivision two of section 160.50 of the criminal procedure law, in connection with the licensing, employment or providing of credit to such person; provided, however, that the prohibition of such inquiries or adverse action shall not apply to licensing activities in relation to the regulation of guns firearms and other deadly weapons or in relation to an application for employment as a police officer or peace officer as those terms are defined in subdivisions thirty-three and thirty-four of section 1.20 of the Criminal Procedure Law] in writing or otherwise, regarding any arrest or criminal accusation of an applicant or employee when such inquiry is in violation of subdivision 16 of section 296 of article 15 of the New York state executive law.\r\n      11-a.

For purposes of this subdivision, with respect to an applicant for temporary employment at a temporary help firm as such term is defined by subdivision five of section 916 of article 31 of the New York labor law, an offer to be placed in the temporary help firm's general candidate pool shall constitute a conditional offer of employment.

For purposes of this paragraph federal law shall include rules or regulations promulgated by a self-regulatory organization as defined in section 3(a)(26) of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended.\r\n      (f) This subdivision shall not apply to any actions taken by an employer or agent thereof with regard to an applicant for employment: \r\n      (1) as a police officer or peace officer, as those terms are defined in subdivisions thirty-three and thirty-four of section 1.20 of the criminal procedure law, respectively, or at a law enforcement agency as that term is used in article 23-a of the correction law, including but not limited to the police department, the fire department, the department of correction, the department of investigation, the department of probation, the division of youth and family services, the business integrity commission, and the district attorneys' offices; or  \r\n      (2) listed in the determinations of personnel published as a commissioner's calendar item and listed on the website of the department of citywide administrative services upon a determination by the commissioner of citywide administrative services that the position involves law enforcement, is susceptible to bribery or other corruption, or entails the provision of services to or safeguarding of persons who, because of age, disability, infirmity or other condition, are vulnerable to abuse.  If the department takes adverse action against any applicant based on the applicant's arrest or criminal conviction record, it shall provide a written copy of such analysis performed under article twenty-three a of the correction law to the applicant in a form and manner to be determined by the department.\r\n      (g) The provisions of this subdivision shall be enforceable against public agencies by a proceeding brought pursuant to article seventy-eight of the Civil Practice Law and Rules, and the provisions of this subdivision shall be enforceable against private employers by the commission through the administrative procedure provided for in this chapter or as provided in chapter five of this title. For purposes of this paragraph only, the terms \"public agency\" and \"private employer\" shall have the meaning given such terms in section seven hundred fifty of the correction law.\r\n      11-b.  Arrest record; credit application.  For purposes of issuing credit, it shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice, unless specifically required or permitted by any other law, to:\r\n      (a) deny or act adversely upon any person seeking credit by reason of an arrest or criminal accusation of such person when such denial or adverse action is in violation of subdivision 16 of section 296 of article 15 of the New York state executive law; or \r\n      (b) make any inquiry in writing or otherwise, regarding any arrest or criminal accusation of a person seeking credit when such inquiry is in violation of subdivision 16 of section 296 of article 15 of the New York state executive law.\r\n      � 3.
