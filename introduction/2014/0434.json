The information contained in the sub-directory created and maintained pursuant to subdivision one of this section shall be updated on a monthly basis to reflect any changes to the information contained in the registry created pursuant to this Chapter.  Gun offenders who are no longer required to register pursuant to section 10-604 of this Chapter shall have their information immediately removed from the sub-directory created and maintained pursuant to subdivision one of this section.\n      3.

The department must also allow any person to apply, via the website created pursuant to subdivision two of this section, to receive automated e-mail notifications whenever a new or updated registration occurs in a geographic area specified by such person.  The department shall furnish such service at no charge and the web forms shall be developed and provided by the department or any other city agency at the request of the department.\n      5.

The information available on this website is based on the New York City Council's decision to facilitate access to publicly-available criminal information about persons convicted of certain gun-related offenses as defined in Chapter Six of the Administrative Code of the City of New York.  The New York City Police Department has not considered or assessed the specific risk of re-offense with regard to any individual prior to his or her inclusion on this website, and inclusion on this website does not mean that an individual is currently dangerous.  Individuals included on this website are included solely by virtue of their conviction record and City law.  The purpose of providing this data on the Internet is to make the information more easily available and accessible, not to warn about any specific individual or threat.\n      b.  Any person who uses information on this website in violation of law is subject to a fine of not less than five hundred dollars and not more than one thousand dollars.\n      � 10-610.
