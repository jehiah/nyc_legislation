  "Summary": "This bill requires secondhand automobile dealers to disclose recall information to consumers when selling automobiles, parts or equipment that are the subject of a recall by the national highway transportation safety administration or the NHTSA.  Such disclosure, which would be signed by the purchaser, would be retained by the dealer for five years, and subject to inspection by the Department of Consumer Affairs.  This bill would impose a $1000 fine for a first offense, a $1000 fine or imprisonment for a second offense, and suspension or revocation of a dealer’s license at the discretion of the commissioner for any subsequent offenses during a three year period.",
