For the purposes of this section, maximum levels shall include but shall not be limited to indoor air contamination which equals the maximum allowed by air guidance values set forth by the New York state department of health, soil gas under or within one hundred feet of a public school which equals the maximum allowed by guidance levels set forth by the New York state department of health, soil contamination which equals the maximum allowed by guidance levels set forth by the New York state department of environmental conservation in subpart 375.6 of title 6 of the official compilation of codes, rules and regulations of the state of New York or successor regulations, and the maximum allowed contaminant level of a contaminant in water delivered to any user of a public water system, including groundwater at or within one hundred feet of a public school, as set forth in subpart 5-1 of part 5 of title 10 of the official compilation of codes, rules and regulations of the state of New York or successor regulations.  \n       \"Pollutant\" shall mean any substance the emissions of which cause or contribute to air pollution, as set forth in part 50 of title 40 of the code of federal regulations or any successor regulations. \n      \"Public school\" shall mean any school in a building owned or leased by the department, including charter schools, that contains any combination of grades from pre-kindergarten through grade twelve and any grounds adjacent to a building owned or leased by the department in which a school is located.\n      \"Proposed public school\" shall mean property for which the department or the New York city school construction authority has executed a lease agreement for the siting of a public school. \n      \"Reportable environmental inspection\" shall mean any environmental inspection conducted in or adjacent to an occupied or unoccupied public school or proposed public school by or under the direction of the department or the New York city school construction authority, including any inspection conducted at the request of the United States environmental protection agency, the United States department of labor, the New York state department of environmental conservation, the New York state department of health, or the New York state department of labor or pursuant to a consent order or agreement by or with a regulatory agency, to determine the quality of the air, soil, water, or indoor environment, and that yields results that exceed maximum levels based on industry standards and current scientific data.
