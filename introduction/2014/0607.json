  "Summary": "This bill would create a task force to study the issues involved with requiring New York City Police Department officers to wear body-worn cameras that record their activities. The task force would be comprised of three members appointed by the Mayor, three members appointed by the Speaker of the City Council, and four members appointed jointly by the Mayor and the Speaker of the City Council. The task force would be required to submit a report within one year of its final member being appointed. This report must include information regarding a body-worn camera program: its cost, privacy implications, best practices regarding data storage, when such cameras must be recording and when they may be switched off, evidentiary issues involved in using such footage, and any other recommendations the task force believes will assist in implementing a body-worn camera program.",
