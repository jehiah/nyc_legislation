  "Summary": "The bill would require the Office of Civil Justice Coordinator to establish programs to provide all tenants facing eviction with access to legal services within five years. Low-income individuals with eviction cases in housing court would have full legal representation, while other tenants would receive brief legal assistance. By October 2017, the Office would also establish and begin implementing a program to provide legal services to all New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) tenants in administrative proceedings to terminate their tenancy. Each year, the Office would hold annual public hearings and issue reports on the progress and effectiveness of the programs, as well as the amount of funding needed to continue its implementation.",
