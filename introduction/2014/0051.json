  "Summary": "The proposed legislation would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to issue an annual report regarding Hepatitis B (HBV) and Hepatitis C (HCV). HBV and HCV can cause chronic, persistent infection, which can lead to chronic liver disease. The information required to be reported by the proposed legislation would include:\r\n•\tThe number of new cases and the prevalence of HBV and HCV infections, and the top five causes of HBV & HCV in new cases;\r\n•\tDemographic information (e.g., age, gender, neighborhood, borough, national origin, race and ethnicity) of persons infected with HBV and HCV;\r\n•\tThe number of deaths where HBV or HCV was a factor, the number of new liver cancer diagnoses, and the number of liver cancers diagnoses that overlap with HBV or HCV; \r\n•\tThe number of people in a DOHMH-operated or contracted program or a Council-funded program who are receiving care at various stages;\r\n•\tInformation relating to the number of HBV vaccine doses given and completed; and\r\n•\tInformation relating to DOHMH’s HBV and HCV-related funding, outreach efforts, and program outcomes, as well as best practices in addressing HBV & HCV prevention, treatment, care, outreach and education.\r\nSome of the above information would not be required to be reported every year.  Additionally, some of the demographic and other information would only be culled only from persons who are involved in certain DOHMH-operated or contracted programs or a Council-funded program. Annual reports would be submitted to the Council and available on DOHMH’s website.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      Section 1. Chapter one of title 17 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 17-198 to read as follows: \n      � 17-198 Hepatitis B and hepatitis C data compilation and reporting. On or before September 30 of two thousand sixteen and each year thereafter, the department shall submit an annual report to the speaker of the council and the mayor detailing the department's efforts to identify and prevent the spread of hepatitis B and hepatitis C during the preceding calendar year.  \n      a. Such annual report shall, at minimum, provide separate data on hepatitis B and hepatitis C, disaggregated by disease where applicable, including: \n      (i) the number of persons newly reported to the department with hepatitis B and hepatitis C infections; \n      (ii) the prevalence of diagnosed cases; \n      (iii) the top five causes of hepatitis B and hepatitis C infections in newly reported cases to the department where a cause is indicated; \n      (iv) the demographic information, including age, gender, zip code or other neighborhood-level designation, borough and, in cases where data is available, country of birth, of persons infected with hepatitis B and persons infected with hepatitis C; \n      (v) the demographic information, including, to the extent available, age, gender, zip code or other neighborhood-level designation, borough, race, ethnicity and national origin of persons infected with hepatitis B and of persons infected with hepatitis C who receive care or treatment in a program operated or contracted by the department or which receives funding from the council.
