HBV and HCV can cause chronic, persistent infection, which can lead to chronic liver disease. The information required to be reported by the proposed legislation would include:\r\n•\tThe number of new cases and the prevalence of HBV and HCV infections, and the top five causes of HBV \u0026 HCV in new cases;\r\n•\tDemographic information (e.g., age, gender, neighborhood, borough, national origin, race and ethnicity) of persons infected with HBV and HCV;\r\n•\tThe number of deaths where HBV or HCV was a factor, the number of new liver cancer diagnoses, and the number of liver cancers diagnoses that overlap with HBV or HCV; \r\n•\tThe number of people in a DOHMH-operated or contracted program or a Council-funded program who are receiving care at various stages;\r\n•\tInformation relating to the number of HBV vaccine doses given and completed; and\r\n•\tInformation relating to DOHMH’s HBV and HCV-related funding, outreach efforts, and program outcomes, as well as best practices in addressing HBV \u0026 HCV prevention, treatment, care, outreach and education.\r\nSome of the above information would not be required to be reported every year.  Additionally, some of the demographic and other information would only be culled only from persons who are involved in certain DOHMH-operated or contracted programs or a Council-funded program. Annual reports would be submitted to the Council and available on DOHMH’s website.","TextID":55932,"Text":"Int.
