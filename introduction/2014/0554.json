  "Summary": "The Administration for Children’s Services (ACS) provides a variety of services for youth, including runaway and homeless youth, including those young people who have been sexually exploited. The Department of Parks and Recreation, Department of Homeless Services, and Human Resources Administration/Department of Social Services also regularly come into contact with sexually exploited children through their programming. \r\n\r\nThis bill would require the establishment of a training coordinator, in an agency chosen by the Mayor, to teach certain agency staff how to identify runaway, homeless or sexually exploited youth and how connect them with appropriate services. The coordinator will conduct the training with the agency employees of the ACS, the Department of Parks and Recreation, Department of Homeless Services, and Human Resources Administration/Department of Social Services who are regularly in contact with youth. The coordinator will also be responsible for outreach efforts to other entities including, but not limited to, the Department of Education, Police Department, and Department of Probation, as well as health clinics, libraries and hospitals.",
