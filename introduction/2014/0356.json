  "Summary": "This bill would require the mayoral agencies covered by the city’s agency-based voter registration law, which requires nineteen agencies to distribute voter registration forms to individuals who are applying for, renewing, or submitting a change of address with respect to, services, to report twice a year on their implementation of the law. A recent report by a coalition of good government groups found that compliance with the registration law has been lacking. The semi-annual reporting would include data on the number of registration forms distributed and mailed to the Board of Elections. It would go to the Mayor’s Office of Operations, which would consolidate the reports into a single report that it would submit to the Speaker.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      Section 1. Section 1057-A of chapter forty-six of the New York city charter is amended by adding a new subdivision eight to read as follows:\n      8. Each participating agency, other than community boards and the city clerk, shall submit semi-annual reports on their implementation of this section to the mayor's office of operations. Such reports shall include the number of registration forms distributed, the number of registration forms completed at an agency office to the extent readily ascertainable, and the number of registration forms transmitted to the board of elections. Such reports shall be submitted to the mayor's office of operations by January 15 and July 15 of each year, with the first reports due by July 15, 2015. The mayor's office of operations shall compile such reports into a single report that disaggregates such data by agency, and shall deliver such compiled report to the speaker by February 15 and August 15 of each year, with the first such report due by August 15, 2015.\n      � 2.
