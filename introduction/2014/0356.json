  "Summary": "This bill would require the mayoral agencies covered by the city’s agency-based voter registration law, which requires nineteen agencies to distribute voter registration forms to individuals who are applying for, renewing, or submitting a change of address with respect to, services, to report twice a year on their implementation of the law. A recent report by a coalition of good government groups found that compliance with the registration law has been lacking. The semi-annual reporting would include data on the number of registration forms distributed and mailed to the Board of Elections. It would go to the Mayor’s Office of Operations, which would consolidate the reports into a single report that it would submit to the Speaker.",
