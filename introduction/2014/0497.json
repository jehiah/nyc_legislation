The council may by resolution adopt an interest rate to be charged for nonpayment of water rents pursuant to section 11-224 of the code and, for nonpayment of water rents that become due and payable on or after July first, two thousand five, pursuant to section 11-224.1 of the code, and may specify in such resolution the date on which such interest rate is to take effect. \n      � 4.
