  "Summary": "This bill would require the Office of Emergency Management (OEM) to create local emergency preparedness public awareness materials with information relevant to neighborhoods where there is a particular risk of an evacuation due to a coastal storm or hurricane. The materials would provide information such as the locations of the nearest evacuation centers, the borders of evacuation zones and possibly contact information for local organizations that could provide assistance after an emergency. The materials would also be translated into the ten most commonly spoken languages within that community, and made available online.",
