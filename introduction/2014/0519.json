The materials would provide information such as the locations of the nearest evacuation centers, the borders of evacuation zones and possibly contact information for local organizations that could provide assistance after an emergency. The materials would also be translated into the ten most commonly spoken languages within that community, and made available online.","TextID":55476,"Text":"Int.
