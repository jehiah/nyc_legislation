Notwithstanding any other provision of law, [E]every person, corporation, or body that shall violate or not conform to any provisions of the health code of the city of New York or any applicable law, rule or regulation pertaining to the eradication of rodents, the elimination of rodent harborages or other rodent related nuisances shall be liable to pay a civil penalty of not less than three hundred dollars for the first violation. The penalty for each subsequent violation of the same provision of law, rule or regulation, at the same premises and under the same ownership or control, within a two-year period, shall be double the amount of the previous violation; provided, however, that such penalty shall not exceed the maximum allowable penalty set forth in section 17-133 of this code. Such penalties may be sued for and recovered by and in the name of the department, with costs, before any judge, justice, administrative law judge or hearing examiner in the city having jurisdiction of such or similar actions.
