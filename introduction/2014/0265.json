  "Summary": "Int. No. 265 would clarify that DCA shall enforce applicable consumer protection provisions against plumbers, electricians and other such professionals. The bill would ensure that regulations related to deceptive trade practices, false advertising and other consumer related offenses would apply to anyone making home repairs and establish better communication between the agencies that regulate home repair businesses by requiring DCA to notify DOB whenever someone licensed by DOB is found guilty of violating title 20 of the Administrative Code.",
