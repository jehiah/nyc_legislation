This bill would increase the civil penalties for those leaving the scene of an incident without reporting on more than one occasion. Repeat offenders would be subject to pay a civil penalty of up to $1,000 if property damage results from the incident; $2,00-$5,000 if a person is injured; $10,000-$15,000 if there is a serious injury; and $15,000-$20,000 if death results. The bill would also raise the maximum penalty for a first offense involving property damage to $1,000 and the penalty for a first offense resulting in death from $5,000-$10,000 to $10,000-$15,000.",
