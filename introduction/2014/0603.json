  "Summary": "In 2014, the Council enacted Local Law 50, instituting civil penalties for leaving the scene of an incident without reporting. This bill would increase the civil penalties for those leaving the scene of an incident without reporting on more than one occasion. Repeat offenders would be subject to pay a civil penalty of up to $1,000 if property damage results from the incident; $2,00-$5,000 if a person is injured; $10,000-$15,000 if there is a serious injury; and $15,000-$20,000 if death results. The bill would also raise the maximum penalty for a first offense involving property damage to $1,000 and the penalty for a first offense resulting in death from $5,000-$10,000 to $10,000-$15,000.",
