  "Summary": "Drivers licensed by the Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) can face fines and civil penalties for violations of dozens of TLC rules and Administrative Code provisions. If a TLC-licensed driver does not pay any owed fines or penalties within 30 days of a decision of the Taxi and Limousine Tribunal, their license will be suspended. Under the bill, the TLC would be required to establish a payment plan program to allow drivers to pay fines and penalties in installments and would be prohibited from suspending a driver’s TLC license for non-payment, so long as the driver is in compliance with the payment plan.",
