  "Summary": "An accessible pedestrian signal (“APS”) is a device that communicates information about pedestrian timing in nonvisual format such as audible tones, verbal messages, and vibrating surfaces. APS generally provide information to pedestrians about the existence and location of the pushbutton, the beginning of the “WALK” interval, the direction of the crosswalk, and location of the destination curb. In 2012, the Council enacted a local law requiring the New York City Department of Transportation (“DOT”) to establish an APS program and annually install accessible pedestrian signals at each corner of 25 identified intersections. The bill would increase the minimum number of intersections at which DOT must install an APS to 75.",
