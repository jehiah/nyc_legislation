  "Summary": "Under the bill, the Department of Transportation (DOT) would be required to conduct a study on truck route compliance. The study would include locations where large numbers of truck drivers regularly operate off designated truck routes may also include areas of concern identified by Council Members and Community Boards. Based on the study, the DOT would institute measures to increase truck route compliance, including but not limited to, converting two-way streets to one-way streets, posting of signs regarding the permissible use of certain routes by trucks, and education and outreach to the trucking industry. DOT would post the study, including the locations of such measures, on its website and submit a copy to the Council no later than January 1, 2017.",
