  "Summary": "Int. No. 298-A would limit the circumstances under which a person other than a licensed rigger could supervise the hoisting or lowering of articles on the outside of a building. It would also require that, where hoisting or lowering of articles on the outside of a building is performed by or under the supervision of a person who is not a licensed rigger, such person must complete a Department of Buildings-approved training course (rather than having the option of completing an accredited certification program).",
