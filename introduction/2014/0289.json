  "Summary": "Title 8 of the New York City Administrative Code requires certain agencies to provide materials in languages other than English, but the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) is not currently subject to this requirement. This bill would require HPD to make all applications and corresponding instruction materials available in English, Arabic, Chinese, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, and Spanish and allow HPD to use additional languages at its discretion. It would also require HPD to provide a notice, listing all the languages in which applications are available, with all application forms, on HPD’s website and in areas of HPD offices that are open to the public.",
