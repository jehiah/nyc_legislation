  "Summary": "This bill would require landlords to provide building occupants with two weeks’ notice prior to making a building amenity unavailable if the amenity will be unavailable for more than twenty-four hours, excluding periods during which the amenity is normally unavailable. The notice would have to be posted in a prominent place in the building, identify the amenity which is to be made unavailable and state the expected duration of its unavailability. Where an amenity will be permanently unavailable, the notice must remain posted for at least 30 days after the amenity becomes unavailable. Building amenities made unavailable on an emergency basis would be exempt from the notice requirement. This bill would also require HPD to publish rules regarding what constitutes an emergency basis.",
