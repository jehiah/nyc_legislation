  "Summary": "New York State approves defensive driving course that educate motorists on safe driving habits and applicable laws, as well as allow individuals to remove points from their driving record and lower insurance premiums. However, these courses only apply to those operating a motor vehicle.\r\n\r\nUnder the bill, the New York City Department of Transportation (DOT) would be required to establish a bicycle safety course that covers safe bicycling and adherence to State and local laws that apply to bicycles. The bill would allow those facing a civil penalty for a first violation of the Code related to operating a bicycle to complete the course in order to have the penalty waived. In addition, DOT would be required to collaborate with the New York City Police Department on an outreach and public education campaign regarding bicycle safety no later than June 1, 2015.",
