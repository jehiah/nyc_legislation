Section 19-163.1 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\n\t�19-163.1 Suspension of parking, parking meter and muni-meter rules during and after snowfalls. All alternate side of the street parking rules shall be suspended during any snowfall that causes the department of sanitation to suspend its street sweeping operations, provided that the department may reinstate alternate side of the street parking rules after twenty-four hours if it determines, after consulting with the department of sanitation, that alternate side of the street parking is necessary to immediately commence curbside snow removal. Parking meter and muni-meter rules and all other parking regulations, except those regulations that would not permit parking or standing at any time, except for emergency vehicles at such location, shall be suspended for forty-eight hours following the falling of six inches of snow in any part of the city of New York based on the department of sanitation's measurements, provided that at the conclusion of such forty-eight hour period, the department may continue to suspend any and all such parking rules if, in the discretion of the commissioner, such suspension remains necessary in order to facilitate the plowing or removal of snow.  Such forty-eight period shall conclude at the end of the calendar day of the expiration of such forty-eight hours.\n\t�2. \tThis local law shall take effect sixty days after its enactment.\nLF\n1/21/14\nInt.
