DCA inspectors issue violations for each failure to sticker price more than five items in a single stock unit. Int. No. 436 would allow retailers to cure first time violations rather than paying civil penalties.  A retail store would have to submit proof that it has cured the violation within 30 days of receiving a notice of violation.","TextID":58957,"Text":"Int.
