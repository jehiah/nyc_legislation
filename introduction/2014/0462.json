No. 462-A would require the Department of Buildings (DOB) to refer immediately hazardous elevator-related violations to the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) for action under the emergency repair program, if DOB finds that the owner has not corrected those violations. It would also require HPD to report on the number of such referrals and on any actions taken under the emergency repair program in response to such referrals.","TextID":56799,"Text":"Int.

If, upon reinspection of an immediately hazardous violation relating to an elevator that services one or more dwelling units in a multiple dwelling, the department determines that such owner has failed to correct the condition constituting such violation then the commissioner shall refer such violation, within one week of such reinspection, to the commissioner of housing preservation and development for a determination as to whether such violation is dangerous to human life and safety or detrimental to health pursuant to section 27-2125 of the housing maintenance code. If the department knows or has reason to believe that any such unit is not served by another operable elevator, the department shall include such information and any other relevant information in such referral.
