  "Summary": "This bill would change the definition of pet shop in the Animal Abuse Registration Act (AARA) to include pet shops that sell cats and dogs.\r\nThe AARA mandates the establishment of an animal abuse registry listing persons 18 or older who reside in New York City that were convicted of animal abuse crimes. It requires pet shops to consult the registry before selling an animal to any prospective purchaser and prohibits the transfer of any animal to a person whose name appears on the registry.",
