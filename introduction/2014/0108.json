  "Summary": "Many employees throughout New York City, as well the nation, have caregiving and familial responsibilities that include assisting with the care of children, parents, spouses, and other family members. Under section 8-101 of the New York City Human Rights Law, there are a number of protected classes defined, including, but not limited to, “gender,” “sexual orientation,” “partnership status,” “national origin,” “disability,” and “alienage or citizenship status.” These protected classes are covered under Section 8-107 of the Law, which prohibits employment discrimination. This bill would include “caregiver” as a protected class; prohibiting employers from discriminating based on one’s status, or perceived status, as a “caregiver.”",
