  "Summary": "In 2014, the Council enacted Local Law 50, instituting civil penalties for leaving the scene of an incident without reporting. This bill would require that the Police Department (PD) report quarterly the number of notices of violation issued in response to an incident resulting in a critical injury pursuant to that law. PD would also report annually the number of complaints for leaving the scene involving property damage, personal injury, or death, as well as the number of arrests for such an incident involving personal injury or death.",
