  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n \n      Section 1.  Legislative findings and intent.  The council finds that the public libraries of the city of New York provide essential educational and cultural services to the citizens of the city and enrich the education and well-being of the communities they serve, including children and seniors.  The council further finds that without adequate and consistent funding, the libraries are unable to fulfill their mission, and the deficiency undermines their strength in the communities they serve.  The council finds that each year the city's public libraries are threatened with drastic funding cuts from the city of New York, and that such threats are harmful to the operational integrity of the libraries; cause unnecessary confusion to the libraries' patrons; and anxiety to the libraries' employees.  The council finds that the three public library systems serving the city's citizens receive a far smaller percentage of local support when compared to other urban library systems across the country.  The council further finds that an equitable means to remedy this problem is to allocate a certain portion of the city's appropriation to ensure that the libraries and the citizens of New York City know that sufficient funds will be available each year to fund library services.\n      � 2.  Section 5-509 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new subdivision 7 to read as follows:\n      7.  Upon agreement between the mayor and the council, a sum representing two and one-half percent of the real property tax revenue assessed each fiscal year shall be appropriated to the operation and maintenance of the library systems.\n      � 3.  This local law shall take effect immediately. \nTE\n2/20/14\nInt. No. 1050/2013\nLS 801/2014",
