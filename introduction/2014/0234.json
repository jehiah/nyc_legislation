The invasive species advisory board shall hold its first meeting no later than thirty days from the appointment of all its public members and at such meeting shall elect a chairperson and a secretary from its members. The advisory board shall meet at least quarterly, keep a record of its proceedings, and determine the rules of its own proceedings with special meetings to be called by the chairperson upon his or her own initiative or upon receipt of a written request signed by at least four members of the board. Written notice of the time and place of such special meetings shall be given by the secretary to each member at least two weeks before the date fixed by the notice for such special meeting.\r\n      c. The invasive species advisory board may conduct such hearings and meetings at any place or places within the city designated by the board for the purpose of obtaining necessary information or other data to assist it in the proper performance of its duties and functions as it deems necessary.\r\n      d.
