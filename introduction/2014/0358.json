  "Summary": "The bill would require that social adult day cares—programs which provide functionally impaired individuals, such as those suffering from Alzheimer’s or dementia, with personal care, nutritious meals, and the opportunity to socialize in a safe, supervised setting—operating in the City that do not receive direct City or State funding register with the Department for the Aging (DFTA) and adhere to the same standards that apply to directly-funded programs. Program and registration requirements would be enforced through civil penalties. DFTA would promulgate regulations outlining the penalties for specific violations, which would range from $250 to $500 per day, except that failure to register would result in a penalty of $250 to $1,000 per day. The Department of Consumer Affairs (or such other agency designated by the Mayor) will work with DFTA to issue violations for failure to register or follow program standards. In addition, DFTA would appoint an ombudsperson to receive complaints, conduct investigations regarding programs, and refer results of such investigations to any managed long-term care companies reimbursing such program, the New York City Department of Investigation, and the State, as necessary.",
