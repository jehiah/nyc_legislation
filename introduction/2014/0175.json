  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      Section 1. Section 19-162 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\n\t[1] a. Notwithstanding any local law or regulation to the contrary, but subject to the provisions of the vehicle and traffic law, it shall be permissible for a bus owned, used or hired by public or nonpublic schools to park at any time, including overnight, upon any street or roadway, provided said bus occupies a parking spot in front of and within the building lines of the premises of the said public school or nonpublic school. \n\t[2] b. Notwithstanding the department of  transportation  regulation prohibiting parking in  front of private driveways,  it shall be permissible for the owner or lessor of the lot accessed by such driveway to park a passenger vehicle registered to him or her at that address  in front  of  such  driveway,  provided that such lot does not contain more than two dwelling units and, further provided that such parking does not violate any other provision of the vehicle and traffic law or local law, rule or regulation, concerning the  parking,  stopping,  or  standing  of motor  vehicles, except that such owner or lessor shall not be required to abide by laws or rules related to meters or muni-meters while parked at such address in front of such driveway.  The  hearing  officer  shall  dismiss  any  notice  of violation issued to the owner of such  passenger  vehicle  upon  receipt from  the  owner,  in  person  or  by  mail,  of  a  copy of the vehicle registration containing the same address as that at which the ticket was given or other suitable evidence showing compliance with  the  law.  The director of the bureau shall set forth the proof required in the case of lots where confusion may arise including, but not limited to, corner lots or lots with dual addresses.  For the purposes of this paragraph, the term \"muni-meter\" shall mean an electronic parking meter that dispenses timed receipts.\n      ï¿½ 2. This local law shall take effect ninety days after its enactment into law.\n\nLF\nLS # 719/2014\nInt. No. 824/2012\n2/13/14",
