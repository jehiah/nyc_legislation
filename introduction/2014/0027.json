Legislative findings and declaration.  Staten Island's health care infrastructure has not kept pace with the expanding needs of the borough.  There are nearly 500,000 residents on Staten Island, but there are only two hospitals.  In addition, Staten Island remains the only borough without a Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC) full service hospital.   \r\n      The Council finds that there is a hospital crisis on Staten Island.  Based on this finding, the Council determines that it is necessary to create a task force to study individual unit bed availability for hospitals on Staten Island and draft recommendations for a more effective allocation of hospital beds per unit to alleviate elements of the hospital crisis.    \r\n\t�2.  Staten Island Hospitals Task Force.  a. There shall be a task force to study individual unit bed availability in Staten Island hospitals and to make specific recommendations to the mayor and council for the effective allocation of resources related to hospital care on Staten Island.  \r\n\tb. Such advisory board shall consist of nine members as follows:    \r\n      i. Four members shall be appointed by the mayor, provided that at least one such member shall be a medical professional and shall have experience in hospital administration.\r\n      ii. Three members shall be appointed by the speaker of the council, provided that at least one member shall be an employee of a Staten Island hospital.\r\n      iii. The commissioner of health and the director of city planning, or their designees, shall serve ex officio.  \r\niv. The members shall be appointed within sixty days of the enactment of this local law.\r\n      v. At its first meeting, the advisory board shall select a chairperson from among its members by majority vote of the advisory board.  \r\n      c. Each member shall serve for a term of twelve months, to commence after the final member of the advisory board is appointed.  Any vacancies in the membership of the advisory board shall be filled in the same manner as the original appointment.  A person filling such vacancy shall serve for the unexpired portion of the term of the succeeded member.  \r\n      d. The department of health and the department of city planning may provide staff to assist the task force.\r\n      e. No member of the advisory board shall be removed from office except for cause and upon notice and hearing by the appropriate appointing official.  \r\n      f. Members of the advisory board shall serve without compensation and shall meet no less than once a month.  \r\n      g. No later than twelve months from the date all nine members of the task force are appointed, the task force shall submit to the mayor and the speaker of the council a report that shall include the findings and recommendations of the task force.\r\n      h. The task force shall dissolve upon submission of the report required by subdivision g of this section. \r\n\t�3.
