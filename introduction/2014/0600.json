This includes: 1) the total number of veterans residing in Mitchell-Lama housing; 2) the total number of applications received by HPD for Mitchell-Lama Housing from housing containing at least one veteran; 3) the total number of vending licenses provided by DCA to veterans; 4) the total number of veterans who submitted an application to DCA for a vending license; 5) the total number of veterans residing in NYCHA housing utilizing a HUD-VASH voucher; and 6) the total number of veterans receiving services through HRA-operated job centers in the prior year, disaggregated by the number receiving one-shot assistance grants, cash assistance, and supplemental nutrition assistance program benefits.
