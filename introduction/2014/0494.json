  "Text": "Int. No. 494\r\n\r\nBy Council Members Lancman, Vallone, Constantinides, Palma, Koslowitz, Levin and Ulrich \r\n\r\n..Title\r\nA Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to discrimination against persons accompanied by a police dog.\r\n..Body\r\n\r\nBe it enacted by the Council as follows:\r\n\r\n      Section 1.  Legislative findings.\r\n      New York City police officers in the K-9 unit are required to live with their police dogs and are expected to accompany them at all times. The Council finds that some landlords and property owners discriminate against New York City police officers who are accompanied by their police work dogs by considering the dogs pets rather than working animals. Accordingly, it is necessary to amend the City's Human Rights Law to protect police officers in the K-9 unit from such housing and public accommodations discrimination.  \r\n      �2.  Section 8-101 of chapter one of title eight of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\r\n      In the city of New York, with its great cosmopolitan population, there is  no  greater  danger to the health, morals, safety and welfare of the city and its inhabitants than the existence of groups prejudiced against one another and antagonistic to each other because of  their  actual  or perceived differences, including those based on race, color, creed, age, national   origin,   alienage  or  citizenship  status,  gender,  sexual orientation, disability, marital status, partnership status, any  lawful source of income, status as a victim of domestic violence or status as a victim  of  sex  offenses  or  stalking, whether children are, may be or would be residing with a person, whether a person is accompanied by a police dog, or  conviction  or  arrest  record.  The council  hereby finds and declares that prejudice, intolerance, bigotry, and discrimination, bias-related violence  or  harassment  and  disorder occasioned thereby  threaten  the  rights  and proper privileges of its inhabitants and  menace  the  institutions  and  foundation  of  a  free democratic  state. A  city  agency  is  hereby  created  with  power to eliminate and prevent discrimination from playing any  role  in  actions relating  to  employment,  public  accommodations, and housing and other real estate, and to take other actions against  prejudice,  intolerance, bigotry,  discrimination  and  bias-related  violence  or  harassment as herein provided; and the  commission  established  hereunder  is  hereby given general jurisdiction and power for such purposes.\r\n      �3. Section 8-102 of chapter one of title eight of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new subdivision 28 to read as follows:\r\n      28. The term \"police dog\" shall mean any dog owned or harbored by any state or municipal police department or any state or federal law enforcement agency, which has been trained to aid law enforcement officers and being used for police work purposes. \r\n      �4. Paragraph a of subdivision 4 of section 8-107 of chapter one of title eight of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\r\n      a. It shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice for any person, being the owner, lessee, proprietor, manager, superintendent, agent or employee of any place or provider of public accommodation, because of the actual or perceived race, creed, color, national origin, age, gender, disability, marital status, partnership status, sexual orientation or alienage or citizenship status of any person, or because such person is accompanied by a police dog, directly or indirectly, to refuse, withhold from or deny to such person any of the accommodations, advantages, facilities or privileges thereof, or, directly or indirectly, to make any declaration, publish, circulate, issue, display, post or mail any written or printed communication, notice or advertisement, to the effect that any of the accommodations, advantages, facilities and privileges of any such place or provider shall be refused, withheld from or denied to any person on account of race, creed, color, national origin, age, gender, disability, marital status, partnership status, sexual orientation or alienage or citizenship status, or because such person is accompanied by a police dog,  or that the patronage or custom of any person belonging to, purporting to be, or perceived to be, of any particular race, creed, color, national origin, age, gender, disability, marital status, partnership status, sexual orientation, [or] alienage or citizenship status, or because such person is accompanied by a police dog,  is unwelcome, objectionable or not acceptable, desired or solicited.\r\n      �5. Subparagraphs 1, 2 and 3 of paragraph a of subdivision 5 of section 8-107 of chapter one of title eight of the administrative code of the city of New York are amended to read as follows:\r\n      (1) To refuse to sell, rent, lease, approve the sale, rental or lease or otherwise deny to or withhold from any person or group of persons such a housing accommodation or an interest therein because of the actual or perceived race, creed, color, national origin, gender, age, disability, sexual orientation, marital status, partnership status, or alienage or citizenship status of such person or persons, or because of any lawful source of income of such person or persons, or because children are, may be or would be residing with such person or persons[.], or because such person or group of persons is accompanied by a police dog.\r\n      (2) To discriminate against any person because of such person's actual or perceived race, creed, color, national origin, gender, age, disability, sexual orientation, marital status, partnership status, or alienage or citizenship status, or because of any lawful source of income of such person, or because children are, may be or would be residing with such person, or because such person is accompanied by a police dog, in the terms, conditions or privileges of the sale, rental or lease of any such housing accommodation or an interest therein or in the furnishing of facilities or services in connection therewith.\r\n      (3) To declare, print or circulate or cause to be declared, printed or circulated any statement, advertisement or publication, or to use any form of application for the purchase, rental or lease of such a housing accommodation or an interest therein or to make any record or inquiry in conjunction with the prospective purchase, rental or lease of such a housing accommodation or an interest therein which expresses, directly or indirectly, any limitation, specification or discrimination as to race, creed, color, national origin, gender, age, disability, sexual orientation, marital status, partnership status, or alienage or citizenship status, or any lawful source of income, or whether children are, may be, or would be residing with a person, or because a person is accompanied by a police dog, or any intent to make such limitation, specification or discrimination.\r\n      �6.
