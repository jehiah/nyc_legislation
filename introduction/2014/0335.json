As of the effective date of the local law that added Chapter 7 of Title 25 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York, the living wage rate shall be ten dollars and 20 cents ($10.20) per hour and the health benefits supplement rate, which may be provided in the form of cash wages, health benefits or any combination of the two, shall be one dollar and 55 cents ($1.55) per hour.

The Corporation may convey, lease as lessor or otherwise dispose of real property for a use other than use as a living wage property only where the Corporation complies with Section 25-705(b) of the Administrative Code of the City of New York; provided further that, in the report required by Section 25-705(b)(2) of such code, the Corporation shall specify the reason that disposition of the property for use a living wage property is impracticable or undesirable.  \n\n      4. Strategic Plan. The Corporation shall develop a strategic plan to address the purposes for which it has been formed and shall update such plan from time to time as needed. The Corporation shall provide a copy of such plan, and any updates thereto, to each member.  \n      \n      5. Nondiscrimination and Affirmative Action Policy.
