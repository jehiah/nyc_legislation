The Corporation may convey, lease as lessor or otherwise dispose of real property for a use other than use as a living wage property only where the Corporation complies with Section 25-705(b) of the Administrative Code of the City of New York; provided further that, in the report required by Section 25-705(b)(2) of such code, the Corporation shall specify the reason that disposition of the property for use a living wage property is impracticable or undesirable.  \r\n\r\n      4.
