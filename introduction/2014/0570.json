  "Summary": "The bill would remove the requirement that commuter van services renew their authorization with the Department of Transportation (DOT) every six years and that such services provide DOT with public support statements upon their initial application. Additionally, commuter van services would no longer be required to maintain records of requests for service and trips, as well as passenger manifests. The bill would also repeal a section of the Code referring to temporary restrictions that expired in 1998.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      Section 1. Paragraph 1 of subdivision e of section 19-504.2 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 115 for the year 1993,  is amended to read as follows:\n      (1) The applicant shall have the burden of demonstrating that the service proposed will be required by the present or future public convenience and necessity. The commission shall not issue an authorization to operate a commuter van service unless the commissioner of transportation determines that the service proposed will be required by the present or future public convenience and necessity. Such determination that the service proposed will be required by the present or future public convenience and necessity shall be in effect [for six years after the date of issuance  of  such  authorization,  unless] until such authorization has [not been renewed or has] been revoked by the commission [prior to   the  end  of  such  six-year  period  in which  case  such determination shall be in effect only until the expiration or revocation of such authorization] or such determination has been revoked by the commissioner of transportation. After the [expiration or] revocation of such authorization or such determination of public convenience and necessity, no authorization to operate a commuter van service shall be renewed unless a new determination  is  made  by  the commissioner of transportation that the service proposed will be  required  by  the  present  or  future  public convenience and necessity.\n      � 2. Paragraph 3 of subdivision e of section 19-504.2 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 115 for the year 1993, is amended to read as follows:\n      (3) The commissioner of transportation, after consultation with the state department of transportation, shall make a determination whether the service proposed in the application will be required by the present or future public convenience and necessity. The commissioner of transportation may request that the applicant provide any additional information relevant to such determination; provided, however, that public support statements shall not be required. The commissioner of transportation shall notify the New York city transit authority and all council members and community boards representing any portion of the geographic area set forth in the application for the purpose of obtaining comment on the present or future public convenience and necessity for any proposed service. The commissioner of transportation shall provide for publication in the City Record of a notice of any such application and shall allow for public comment on such application for a period not to exceed sixty days after the date of publication of such notice.
