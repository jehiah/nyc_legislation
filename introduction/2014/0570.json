  "Summary": "The bill would remove the requirement that commuter van services renew their authorization with the Department of Transportation (DOT) every six years and that such services provide DOT with public support statements upon their initial application. Additionally, commuter van services would no longer be required to maintain records of requests for service and trips, as well as passenger manifests. The bill would also repeal a section of the Code referring to temporary restrictions that expired in 1998.",
