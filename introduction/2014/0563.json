  "Summary": "The Administrative Code provides that any determination by the TLC to approve an application for a license to operate a new base station or to renew a license to operate a base station must be subject to review by the Council. However, in 1999, a New York Supreme Court ruled that such a review process- known as a “call up” - impermissibly curtails the authority of the Mayor. The bill would repeal this section of the Code as it has effectively been null and void since the aforementioned decision.",
