  "Summary": "Bus rapid transit (BRT) is a system that is designed to make bus service faster, more reliable and efficient through features such as off-board fare payment and dedicated bus lanes. The New York City Department of Transportation (DOT) and Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) collaborate on a version of BRT called Select Bus Service (SBS), with eight lines implemented since June 2008.\r\n\r\nUnder the bill, DOT would work with the MTA and gather input with the public to develop a citywide BRT plan, due to the Council no later than September 1, 2017. The plan would consider areas of the City in need of additional rapid transit options, strategies for serving growing neighborhoods, potential intra-borough and inter-borough BRT corridors DOT plans to establish by 2027, strategies for integrating BRT with other transit routes, and the anticipated operating costs of additional BRT lines.\t Additionally, DOT would be required to update the Council on the implementation of the plan every two years, through 2027.",
