  "Summary": "This bill would amend the Animal Shelter and Sterilization Act to prohibit a pet shop from releasing a cat or dog to a purchaser until such dog or cat has been implanted with a microchip and such microchip has been registered with the purchaser’s contact information. It would require pet shops to maintain records of the date of sale and the microchip registration information for a period of ten years.\r\n\r\nPet shops that allow shelters and non-profit rescues to use their property for the purpose of making animals available for adoption would be exempt from this bill with respect to those animals.",
