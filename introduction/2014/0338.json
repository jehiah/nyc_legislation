  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      Section 1.  Chapter 22 of the New York city charter is amended by adding a new subchapter 570 to read as follows: \n      570. Panel to review child care regulations.  a.  The department shall establish a temporary panel to review any provisions of the administrative code, the rules of the city of New York, and the New York City health code with which a child day care provider must comply to operate as such a provider, including applicable regulations of the following agencies: the department; the administration for children's services; the department of buildings; and the fire department.  Such panel shall include the commissioners of each such agency or their designees. The mayor shall appoint two additional members and the speaker of the council shall appoint three additional members, provided that such members shall have appropriate expertise in the applicable statutory provisions and regulations.  For purposes of this subchapter, \"child day care provider\" shall have the same meaning as it does in section three hundred ninety of state social services law.  \n      b.  Such panel shall study and evaluate the extent to which such provisions, rules, and health code should be modified to assist potential child day care providers with meeting regulatory objectives while minimizing the costs and administrative burdens borne by such providers. When conducting such study and evaluation, the panel shall consider the following issues: duplicative permitting; fragmented authority for inspection; communication and coordination between relevant agencies; communication between relevant agencies and applicants; consistency of enforcement of applicable codes; and delays in the application and inspection process. \n      c.  Such panel shall report its findings and recommendations for any such modifications in writing to the speaker of the council and the mayor no later than one hundred eighty days after the effective date of the local law that added this subchapter.  \nï¿½2.
