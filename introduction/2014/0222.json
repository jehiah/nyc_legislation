The notice would have to be posted in a prominent place in the building and placed under the door of each dwelling unit. The notice would also have to state the type of work being performed and the estimated start and end date of the service interruption. Work performed on an emergency basis and work performed by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) would be exempt from the notice requirement. This bill would also require HPD to publish rules regarding what constitutes an emergency basis.","TextID":56066,"Text":"Int.
