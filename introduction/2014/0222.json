  "Summary": "This bill would require landlords to provide building occupants with 72-hours-notice prior to performing work which would cause an interruption in building services. The notice would have to be posted in a prominent place in the building and placed under the door of each dwelling unit. The notice would also have to state the type of work being performed and the estimated start and end date of the service interruption. Work performed on an emergency basis and work performed by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) would be exempt from the notice requirement. This bill would also require HPD to publish rules regarding what constitutes an emergency basis.",

Section 27-2005 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new subdivision e to read as follows:\n\te. 1.  The owner of a multiple dwelling shall provide lawful occupants of such multiple dwelling with notice prior to making repairs, or performing other work, that will cause an interruption of any heat, hot water, cold water, gas or electricity service expected to last for two or more hours. The department shall by rule prescribe the form, timing and placement of the notice, provided that the notice shall be publicly posted in a prominent place within the multiple dwelling at least twenty-four hours before the interruption of such service is expected to commence and shall remain posted until such interruption ends. Where the owner expects that an interruption of any heat, hot water, cold water, gas or electricity service will last for less than two hours or where such interruption is due to emergency repairs or work, as defined by department rule, advance notice need not be posted, provided that where such interruption lasts for two or more hours, notice shall be posted as soon as practicable after the commencement of such interruption. Such notice shall identify the service to be interrupted, the type of work to be performed, the expected start and end dates of the service interruption.  The notice shall be updated as needed. Such notice shall be posted in English, Spanish and such other languages as the department may provide by rule.\n\t2. Repairs made pursuant to section 27-2125 of this code shall be exempt from the provisions of this subdivision.\n\t� 2. Section 28-304.10 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 141 for the year 2013, is amended to read as follows:\n� 28-304.10 Occupant notification for elevator work. In occupancy groups [R1] R-1 and [R2] R-2, when an elevator is to be out of service [for alteration work], a notice identifying the type of work to be performed and the expected start and end dates for such outage shall be provided in English, Spanish, and such other languages as the department may provide by rule, in accordance with sections 28-304.10.1 and 28-304.10.2.\n\n� 28-304.10.1 Occupant notification for alteration work. When an elevator is to be out of service for alteration work, notice shall be given to the residential occupants no fewer than 10 business days before the start of the work, except in case of emergency repairs. This notification requirement does not apply to minor alterations and ordinary repairs.\n\n� 28-304.10.2 Occupant notification for other elevator service outages. When all elevators servicing a building or any section of a building are expected to be out of service for two or more hours, notice shall be posted at least twenty-four hours before the start of the work. When all elevators servicing a building or any section of a building are expected to be out of service for less than two hours, or are out of service as the result of emergency work, notice is not required to be posted, except that where such outage lasts for two or more hours, notice shall be posted as soon as practicable after the commencement of such service outage.\n\n\t� 3. This local law takes effect 120 days after it becomes law, except that the commissioner of housing preservation and development and the commissioner of buildings shall take such measures, including the promulgation of rules, as are necessary for its implementation prior to such effective date.  \nJW\nInt.
