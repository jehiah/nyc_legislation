  "Summary": "Introduction No. 403 would require the Department of Education (DOE) to submit to the City Council and post on the DOE’s website an annual report regarding guidance counselors for the current school year. The bill would require the DOE to report: the number of guidance counselors in each school; the guidance counselor to student ratio in each school; whether the guidance counselor is providing counseling assistance to more than one co-located school in a school building; and the number of students served by each guidance counselor and the nature and scope of the counseling received by each student, including academic counseling, college preparatory and career counseling. This bill would also require the annual reports to include the number of guidance counselors in the absent teacher reserve pool, information regarding the DOE’s efforts to recruit guidance counselors for grades seven through twelve, and information on any guidance memorandums issued by the DOE regarding college preparedness. This bill also would require the reports to include demographic information for students in each school, including race, ethnicity, English language learner status, special education status, and the percentage of students eligible for free and reduced price lunch.",
