Until recently, the industry practice, though not required by current TLC rules, has been to dispatch vehicles affiliated with another base only if there is an agreement between the bases. The bill would require an agreement between bases before a livery base may dispatch a livery vehicle affiliated with another base.","TextID":55159,"Text":"Int.
