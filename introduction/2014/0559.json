  "Summary": "Current Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) rules allow a livery base to dispatch livery vehicle affiliated with another base when the passenger is told that this is the case at the time the passenger requests the ride. Until recently, the industry practice, though not required by current TLC rules, has been to dispatch vehicles affiliated with another base only if there is an agreement between the bases. The bill would require an agreement between bases before a livery base may dispatch a livery vehicle affiliated with another base.",
