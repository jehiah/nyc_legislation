  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n      Section 1.  Chapter 1 of title 11 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 11-243.1 to read as follows:\n      � 11-243.1.  Partial abatement for certain rebuilt real property seriously damaged by  the  severe storm that occurred on the twenty-ninth and thirtieth of October, two thousand twelve in a city having a population of one million or more. \n      1. Generally. Notwithstanding any provision of any general, special or local law to the contrary, for the fiscal year beginning on the first of July, two thousand fourteen, the commissioner of finance shall grant a partial abatement of real property taxes in the amount provided in this section to eligible real property as defined in subdivision three of this section on the first of July, two thousand fourteen. If legal title to eligible real property is held by one or more trustees, the beneficial owner or owners shall be deemed to own the property for purposes of this section. Notwithstanding any provision of article four of the real property tax law to the contrary, a property that is receiving benefits pursuant to any other section of article four of the real property tax law shall not be prohibited from receiving a partial abatement pursuant to this section if such property is otherwise eligible to receive such abatement.\n      2. Definitions. As used in this section:\n      a.  \"Actual assessed valuation\" means the assessed valuation of real property prior to the calculation of any transitional assessed valuation pursuant to subdivision three of section eighteen hundred five of the real property tax law, and which is not reduced by any exemption from real property taxes.\n      b. \"Annual tax\" means the amount of real property tax that is imposed on a property for a fiscal year, determined after reduction for any amount from which the property is exempt, or which is abated, pursuant to applicable law. \t\n      c. \"Annual tax attributable to improvements\" means the amount of real property tax that is imposed on a property for a fiscal year, determined after reduction for any amount from which the property is exempt, or which is abated, pursuant to applicable law, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the assessed valuation of the property for such fiscal year that is attributable to the improvements on the property, and the denominator of which is the total assessed valuation of the property for such fiscal year. \n      d. \"Assessed valuation\" means the assessed valuation of real property that was used to determine the annual tax as defined in paragraph b of this subdivision, and which is not reduced by any exemption from real property taxes. For real property classified as class two or class four real property as defined in subdivision one of section eighteen hundred two of the real property tax law to which subdivision three of section eighteen hundred five of the real property tax law applies, unless otherwise provided, the assessed valuation is the lower of the actual assessed valuation as defined in paragraph a of this subdivision and transitional assessed valuation as defined in paragraph j of this subdivision.\n      e. \"Assessed valuation attributable to improvements\" means that portion of the assessed valuation of real property that was used to determine the annual tax attributable to improvements as defined in paragraph c of this subdivision, and which is not reduced by any exemption from real property taxes.\n      f. \"Commissioner  of  finance\" means the commissioner of finance of the city of New York, or his or her designee.\n      g. \"Department of finance\" means the department of finance of the city of New York. \n      h. \"Improvements\" means buildings and other articles and structures, substructures and superstructures erected upon, under or above the land, or affixed thereto, including bridges and wharves and piers and the value of the right to collect wharfage, cranage or dockage thereon.\n      i. \"Total square footage of the improvements on the property\" means, with respect to a fiscal year, the square footage used by the department of finance in determining the assessed valuation attributable to improvements on the property for such fiscal year.\n      j.  \"Transitional assessed valuation\" is the assessed valuation calculated pursuant to subdivision three of section eighteen hundred five of the real property tax law, and which is not reduced by any exemption from real property taxes.\n      3. Eligible real property. For purposes of this section, \"eligible real property\" means any tax lot that contained, on the applicable taxable status date, class one, class two  or class four real property as such class of real property is defined in subdivision one of section eighteen hundred two of the real property tax law, as to which: \n      a. the department of finance reduced the assessed valuation attributable to improvements on the property for the fiscal year beginning on the first of July, two thousand thirteen from the assessed valuation attributable to improvements on the property for the fiscal year beginning on the first of July, two thousand twelve as a result of damage caused by the severe storm that occurred on the twenty-ninth and thirtieth of October, two thousand twelve; \n      b. the department of finance increased the assessed valuation attributable to improvements on the property for the fiscal year beginning on the first of July, two thousand fourteen from the assessed valuation attributable to improvements on the property for the fiscal year beginning on the first of July, two thousand thirteen; and \n      c. the assessed valuation attributable to improvements on the property for the fiscal year beginning on the first of July, two thousand fourteen exceeds the assessed valuation attributable to improvements on the property for the fiscal year beginning on the first of July, two thousand twelve.\n      4.  Amount of  partial abatement. a. Except as provided in paragraph c of this subdivision, eligible real property shall receive a partial abatement of the real property taxes due on such property equal to the amount by which (1) the annual tax on the property for the fiscal year beginning on the first of July, two thousand fourteen exceeds (2) the annual tax on the property for the fiscal year beginning on the first of July, two thousand twelve. \n      b. Notwithstanding paragraph a of this subdivision and except as provided in paragraph c of this subdivision, the amount of the partial abatement of the real property taxes due on eligible real property classified as class two or class four real property as defined in subdivision one of section eighteen hundred two of this chapter to which subdivision three of section eighteen hundred five of this chapter applies shall be equal to the amount of (1) the increase in the actual assessed valuation attributable to an addition to or improvement of the property as provided in subdivision five of section eighteen hundred five of the real property tax law for the fiscal year beginning on the first of July, two thousand fourteen, (2) reduced by the increase in the actual assessed valuation attributable to an addition to or improvement of the property as provided in subdivision five of section eighteen hundred five of the real property tax law for the fiscal year beginning on the first of July, two thousand fourteen, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the transitional assessed valuation for the fiscal year beginning on the first of July, two thousand thirteen, and the denominator of which is the actual assessed valuation for the fiscal year beginning on the first of July, two thousand thirteen, (3) multiplied by the real property tax rate that is applicable to the property for the fiscal year beginning on the first of July, two thousand fourteen.  Eligible real property shall not be eligible for an abatement under this section if the fraction calculated in subparagraph two of this paragraph is equal to or greater than one.\n      c.
