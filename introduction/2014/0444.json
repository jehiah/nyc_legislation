No. 444\r\n\r\nBy Council Members Koo, Gentile and Ulrich \r\n\r\n..Title\r\nA Local Law to amend the New York city charter, in relation to the displaying of the POW/MIA flag on property under the care and control of the department of education.\r\n..Body\r\n\r\nBe it enacted by the Council as follows:\r\n\r\n      Section 1. Legislative intent. The Prisoner of War/Missing in Action (POW/MIA) flag was designed to honor and express the United States' gratitude to those members of the military who have been or remain prisoners of war and those who remain missing in action. The POW/MIA flag is a powerful symbol of our nation's concern and commitment to determining, as fully as possible, the fates of American military personnel still imprisoned or missing overseas. It is the Council's intent to require the POW/MIA flag be flown over every piece of property under the control of the Department of Education whenever the American flag is flown over such property.\r\n      � 2. Title 20 of the New York city charter is amended by adding a new section 530-g to read as follows:\r\n      � 530-g Displaying a POW/MIA flag over department of education property. a. Until such time as all members of the United States Armed Forces listed either as missing in action or prisoners of war are accounted for by the United States government, the chancellor of the department of education shall assure that the Prisoner of War/Missing in Action (POW/MIA) flag is flown over all public property under the care and control of the department of education whenever the American flag is flown over such property.\r\n      b. No later than ninety days after the effective date of this local law, the chancellor shall submit to the mayor and the speaker of the city council a report indicating that all requirements of subdivision a of this section have been met and listing all public property under the care and control of the department of education over which the POW/MIA flag is flown.\r\n      � 3.
