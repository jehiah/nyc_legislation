Legislative findings and declaration.  Participation in team sports has been associated with higher levels of participation in overall physical activity, decreased cardiovascular risks, improved mental health, and a reduction in risky behaviors.  In addition, children who play on three sports teams or more were 27% less likely to be overweight/obese and 40% less likely to be obese compared with children who do not play on any sports team.  Thus, it is important for young people to be encouraged to participate in team sports.  Cricket is the second most popular sport in the world, second only to soccer. There are currently more than 30 cricket fields and leagues across New York city as well as 25 high school teams and an NYPD youth cricket league with a dozen teams.\n      The Council finds that it is important to encourage young people to participate on team sports, that cricket is an increasingly popular sport for young people, and that it would give youth another activity to engage in during Out-of-School Time.  Based on this finding, the Council determines that it is necessary to create a task force to study the health, social, and potential economic benefits of cricket, recommend ways to promote the sport in New York city and identify funding sources for equipment, uniforms, and umpires.  \n\t�2.  Cricket Task Force.  a. There shall be a task force to study the health, social and potential economic benefits of cricket in New York city and to make specific recommendations to the mayor and council for the promotion of the sport of cricket and to identify funding sources for team equipment.  \n\tb.

One member shall be appointed by the speaker of the city council.\n      iii. One member shall be appointed by each of the five borough presidents.\niv. The members shall be appointed within sixty days of the enactment of this local law.\n      v. At its first meeting, the task force shall select a chairperson from among its members by majority vote of the task force.  \n      c. Each member shall serve for a term of twelve months, to commence after the final member of the task force is appointed.  Any vacancies in the membership of the task force shall be filled in the same manner as the original appointment.  A person filling such vacancy shall serve for the unexpired portion of the term of the succeeded member.  \n      d.
