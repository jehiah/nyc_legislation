Subdivision a of section 14-115 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\r\n      a. (1) The commissioner shall have power, in his or her discretion, on conviction by the commissioner, or by any court or officer of competent jurisdiction, of a member of the force of any criminal offense, or neglect of duty, violation of rules, or neglect or disobedience of orders, or absence without leave, or any conduct injurious to the public peace or welfare, or immoral conduct or conduct unbecoming an officer, or any breach of discipline, to punish the offending party by reprimand, forfeiting and withholding pay for a specified time, suspension, without pay during such suspension, or by dismissal from the force; but no more than thirty days' salary shall be forfeited or deducted for any offense. All such forfeitures shall be paid forthwith into the police pension fund. \r\n      (2) (i) Where the punishment imposed by the commissioner or his or her deputies is different than the punishment recommended in the findings and recommendation reports of the New York City Police Department Deputy Commissioner of Trials, or the Civilian Complaint Review Board, the commissioner shall, within thirty days of the imposition of such penalty, submit to the entity that provided the recommendation report, a written explanation stating the specific reasons for the commissioner's decision to deviate from the recommended penalty or finding, provided, however, that such written explanation need not be provided within thirty days if so doing would interfere with any ongoing investigations.

Paragraph 6 of subdivision c and paragraph 3 of subdivision d of section 440 of chapter 18-A of the New York City Charter are amended to read as follows:\r\n      c.
