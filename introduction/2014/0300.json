The bill clarifies the bounds of that area by making clear that the fire hydrant itself must also be cleared, narrowing the area to a size that is more closely in line with what the Fire Department needs for access to the hydrant, and clarifying that property owners are not required to actively clear snow and other material from the street itself. The bill also makes the penalties for failing to clear snow from such area consistent with the penalties for failing to clear snow from a sidewalk.  It also removes the criminal penalties for failure to remove snow from sidewalks.","TextID":58710,"Text":"Int.
