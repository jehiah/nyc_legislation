  "Summary": "Under the bill, using an electronic communications device while operating a bicycle would be prohibited. The ban on using electronic communications devices while biking would not apply to: 1) government officers or employees—including law enforcement—acting in an official capacity; 2) those using a device in a hands-free mode; 3) those using a device to report an emergency; 4) those using a device while stationary. Violations of the prohibition would be a traffic infraction punishable by a civil penalty of no more than $50. However, those found in violation for the first time would not be liable for the civil penalty so long as no damage or injury was caused in connection with the violation. An individual found to be in violation more than once within an eighteen-month period would be liable for an additional civil penalty of $50 to $200.",
