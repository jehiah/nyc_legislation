Services performed by a designated organization pursuant to this chapter or any contract or other agreement entered into pursuant to this chapter shall not be used to satisfy any obligations or responsibilities of such designated organization pursuant to any other program or any other agreement or contract.   \n      � 2. If any provision of this local law is for any reason found to be invalid, in whole or in part, by any court of competent jurisdiction, such finding shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this local law, which shall continue in full force and effect.\n      � 3.  This local law shall take effect one hundred eighty days after enactment except that the commissioner for the aging shall promulgate any rules and take such actions as are necessary prior to such effective date.\n      \nKET 2/11/14 4:59PM\nInt. 90/2010 \nLS 47/2014\n\n2",
