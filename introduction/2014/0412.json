  "Summary": "Under the bill, owners of single newsracks would be required prior to installation to provide the City with identifying information, to certify that all related newsrack laws have been complied with.  The owner would be required to resubmit this information annually. The owners would also be required to notify the City prior to the removal of newsracks. The City would grant each newsrack a unique identification number. \r\n\r\nThe bill would require owners of modular newsracks (a newsrack with multiple publications) to submit a plan to the City for approval and local community boards for comment, and to comply with any modifications required by the City. The owners of modular newsracks would also be required to consult with existing publications, existing newsrack owners on the same block, and to comply with space, distance, and cost and fee requirements.",

No modular newsrack shall be placed or installed on a sidewalk after January 1, 2015 unless such newsrack has been included in a modular newsrack plan approved by the department pursuant to this section. \n      2. Any person or entity may submit a modular newsrack plan to the department to request replacement of single newsracks with one or more modular newsracks in all or part of a community district or business improvement district.

Proof of such communication shall be submitted to the department along with the modular newsrack plan.\n      i.  Review of modular newsrack plan.  The department shall take into consideration any comments received from a community board on a modular newsrack plan and shall review the modular newsrack plan for its conformity to the following criteria:\n      1. sufficient modular newsrack space exists to accommodate all historically present publications identified in the plan;\n      2. every historically present publication identified in the plan was offered a space within a modular newsrack on that same sidewalk block; \n      3. implementation of such plan will not violate subdivision b of this section;\n      4. the plan contains a mechanism that allows non-historically present publications to apply for and, without unreasonable delay, be granted space within a modular newsrack on the identified sidewalk block(s) in accordance with the provisions of this section, if space exists within such modular newsrack; \n      5. the plan was submitted to the applicable community board(s) as required; and\n6. the plan includes any other information that the department considers necessary to assess the plan. \n      j. Modification of modular newsrack plan.

Compliance with modular newsrack plan. Modular newsrack plans shall be implemented in compliance with their terms and the provisions of subdivision i of this section. In the event of non-compliance, the commissioner shall issue a notice of correction as provided in subparagraph a of paragraph one of subdivision f of this section. \n      l.   Allocation of publication space. 1. The modular newsrack owner must accommodate a publication's request for space within its modular newsrack(s) within ninety days of receipt of such request, if space is available in such modular newsrack. In the event of non-compliance, the commissioner shall issue a notice of correction as provided in subparagraph a of paragraph one of subdivision f of this section.\n      2.  A publication shall not be placed in more than one space in any modular newsrack.  A publication may be placed in two modular newsracks upon the same sidewalk block, provided that all other publications seeking a space in a modular newsrack on such sidewalk block have been offered a space.  If a publication is placed in two modular newsracks on the same sidewalk block and another publication seeks a space on such sidewalk block, the publication with two spaces on such sidewalk block must promptly vacate one of the two modular newsracks.   \n      m.  Notice by modular newsrack owner. Upon department approval of a modular newsrack plan, modular newsrack owners must submit written notice to all owners of single newsracks located on the sidewalk block(s) identified in an approved modular newsrack plan.  Such notice shall state that modular newsracks have been approved by the department for  operation on such sidewalk block(s) in accordance with such plan. A copy of such notice, along with proof of notice to all owners of single newsracks located on the sidewalk block(s) identified in an approved modular newsrack plan, shall be submitted to the department prior to installation of the modular newsracks. \n      n.  Distance restriction. 1. No single newsrack shall be placed on a sidewalk block containing a modular newsrack except as provided in this subdivision.

In the event of non-compliance, the commissioner shall issue a notice of correction as provided in subparagraph a of paragraph one of subdivision f of this section. \n      2.  Single newsracks may only be placed on a sidewalk block containing a modular newsrack when insufficient modular newsrack space exists for the publication to be contained in such modular newsrack.\n      o.  Modular newsrack cost and fees. The modular newsrack owner shall bear the entire cost of maintaining its newsrack and shall not charge any fee to publications occupying space in its modular newsrack(s), except for reasonable fees as set forth by the department relating to the initial purchase of newsrack doors, including any coin mechanisms, and repair or replacement of newsrack doors and door parts.  In the event of non-compliance, the commissioner shall issue a notice of correction as provided in subparagraph a of paragraph one of subdivision f of this section.  The department shall make available on its website, and annually update, a schedule of fees relating to the initial purchase of newsrack doors and repair or replacement of newsrack doors and door parts.\n      p. Severability. If any subdivision, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence or clause of this section is for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional by the decision of any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this section.\n      � 3.  If any portion of this local law is, for any reason, declared unconstitutional or invalid, in whole or in part, by any court of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed severable, and such unconstitutionality or invalidity shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this law, which shall continue in full force and effect.\n      � 4.  This local law shall take effect ninety days after it shall have become a law, except that the commissioner of the department of transportation may take all actions necessary, including the promulgation of rules, to implement this local law on or before the date upon which it shall take effect.\nLF\nLS#'s 366, 500\n3/4/14",
