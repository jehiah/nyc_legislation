  "Summary": "The Department of Buildings (DOB) issues stop work orders where building work is being done in a dangerous or unsafe manner. This bill would require DOB to post online a list of address which received a notice or order to stop work and the date on which the notice or order to stop work was given as well as a list of addresses for which a notice or order to stop work was rescinded and the date of the rescission. The information would have to be disaggregated by zip code, and for each zip code, disaggregated by community district and council district.",
