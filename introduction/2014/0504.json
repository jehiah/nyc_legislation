The bill would also allow households to opt out of receiving a hard copy of the voter guide, require that the voter guide be available online and require that the voter guide include information about poll site locations and maps of congressional districts, state senate districts and state assembly districts.","TextID":53488,"Text":"Int.

In any year in which the board publishes a voters guide, if the board determines that the amount of money in its budget is insufficient or likely to be insufficient for the publication and distribution of the voters guide, it shall report such determination to the director of the office of management and budget, who, after consultation with the board, shall, without an appropriation, transfer to the board a reasonable amount, as the director shall determine, to cover the cost of publishing and distributing the voters guide.\n      � 2.
