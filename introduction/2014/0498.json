The bill would also require every contractor that enters into a contract with a city agency, an elected official, or the Council, where the contract by itself or when aggregated with all contracts awarded to the contractor by a contracting agency during the immediately preceding twelve months has a value of $10,000,000 or more, to certify that the contractor has complied with the standards promulgated by the city chief procurement officer and that no conflict exists.",
