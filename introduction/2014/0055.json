Chapter 3 of title 17 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new subchapter 9 to read as follows:\n      Subchapter 9\n      PET SHOPS\n      \n�17-371 Definitions.\n�17-372 Pet shop permits required.\n�17-373 Permit applications.\n�17-374 Permit expiration dates; fees.\n�17-375 Permits not transferable; exception.\n�17-376 Conditions of permit and health code to be observed.\n�17-377 Permit to be kept on premises; mutilation prohibited.\n�17-378 Permit suspension and revocation.\n�17-379 Denial of issuance or renewal, suspension and revocation; when effective; service of order or notice.\n�17-380 Forfeiture and seizure.\n�17-381 Penalties.\n�17-382 Rules.\n\n\n      �17-371  Definitions.  For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings: \n      a. \"Arm's length transaction\" means a sale of a business for consideration that reflects the fair market value of such business or its assets, between two informed and willing parties, that is not made, wholly or in part, for the purpose of enabling the seller to avoid liability for violations issued by the department. A sale shall be presumed not to be an arm's length transaction if it is:\n      1. A sale to an individual, or to a corporation or other business that is owned by the spouse, domestic partner, parent, grandparent, child or stepchild of any of any of the sellers, or is the direct descendent of a grandparent, the spouse or domestic partner of any of the sellers;\n      2. A sale to an individual or entity that has a business or financial interest in the seller; or\n      3. A sale to an entity in which any of the sellers has a business or financial relationship.\n      b. \"Breeder\" shall have the same meaning as set forth in section 17-1701 of this title.\n      c. \"Permit\" means a written license and authorization to carry on specified activities as regulated by this subchapter or other applicable law enforced by the department.\n      d. \"Permittee\" means a natural person or other entity who holds a valid permit issued by the commissioner pursuant to this subchapter or other applicable law enforced by the department.\n      e. \"Person\" means any individual, corporation, partnership, association, municipality, or other legal entity.\n      f. \"Pet shop\" means a facility other than an animal shelter where live animals are sold, exchanged, bartered, or offered for sale as pet animals to the general public at retail for profit.  Such definition shall not include breeders who sell or offer to sell directly to consumers fewer than twenty-five dogs or cats per year that are born and raised on the breeder's residential premises.  Such definition shall not include duly incorporated humane societies dedicated to the care of unwanted animals that make such animals available for adoption, whether or not a fee for such adoption is charged.  A person who allows an animal shelter, animal rescue group or non-profit rescue group, as such terms are defined in section 17-1701 of chapter seventeen of this title, to use such person's premises for the purpose of making animals available for adoption shall not be deemed a pet shop as a result of such activity so long as such person does not have an ownership interest in any of the animals being made available for adoption, and does not derive a fee for providing such adoption services.    \n      �17-372  Pet shop permits required. a. No person shall operate a pet shop without a permit issued by the commissioner pursuant to this subchapter.  \n      b. Operating a business or conducting an activity regulated by this subchapter without the permit therefor is hereby declared a nuisance.\n      1. No person may operate a business or conduct an activity regulated by this subchapter without the permit required by this subchapter.\n      2. No person may allow the operation of a business or the conduct of an activity regulated by this subchapter in any property owned by such person unless the person operating such business or conducting such activity has a permit as required by this section.\n      3. When the department determines that a business or activity regulated by this subchapter is being operated or conducted without the permit required by this section, the commissioner or his or her designee may order the person operating the business or conducting the activity to cease and desist from such business or activity. The department may also order the person who owns the premises in which the business is operated or activity is conducted to take whatever action may be necessary to prohibit such business or activity from continuing on such premises.\n      4. If the business or activity ordered to cease and desist continues without the required permit, the commissioner or his or her designee may, after providing an opportunity for the person operating such business or conducting such activity to be heard at the environmental control board or any tribunal established within the office of administrative trials and hearings as designated by the commissioner, take any measure authorized by applicable law to enforce an order to cease and desist. Such measures may include, but are not limited to, ordering and arranging for the premises to be sealed and padlocked.\n      5. If the commissioner determines that exigent circumstances exist such that the continued operation of the business or activity would pose an danger to the public or the health and welfare of the animals in the custody of the business, the commissioner may take any measure authorized by applicable law to enforce an order to cease and desist, subject to a prompt post-enforcement hearing at the environmental control board or any tribunal established within the office of administrative trials and hearings as designated by the commissioner.  \n      �17-373  Permit applications. a.

The acceptance of an application and fee for a new permit or the renewal of a permit shall not preclude the commissioner from taking any action that he or she deems necessary, including, but not limited to, the denial of a new permit or renewal permit if department or other investigatory or pre-permit inspections disclose conditions or circumstances indicating that a permit should not be issued or renewed.

Such maintenance shall include removing and destroying any agents injurious to the health of the animal.\n      (a) Primary enclosures shall be cleaned on a daily basis.  \n      (b) Primary enclosures shall be sanitized at least once every two weeks using one of the following methods:\n      (i) live steam under pressure; or\n      (ii) washing with soap or detergent and water with a temperature of at least one hundred eighty degrees Fahrenheit; or\n      (iii) washing all soiled surfaces with appropriate detergent solutions and disinfectant or by using a combination detergent or disinfectant product that accomplishes the same purpose with a thorough cleaning of the surfaces to remove excreta, feces, hair, dirt, debris and food waste so as to remove all organic and mineral buildup and to provide sanitization, \tfollowed by a clean water rinse.\n      (c) Under no circumstances shall the animal remain inside the primary enclosure or cage while it is being cleaned with sterilizing agents or agents toxic to animals or cleaned in a manner likely to threaten the health and safety of the animal.  \n      (d) Trash and waste products on the premises shall be properly contained and disposed of so as to minimize the risks of disease, contamination, and vermin.\n      3. (a) Animals shall be provided with wholesome and palatable food, free from contamination and having nutritional value sufficient to maintain each animal in good health.\n      (b) Animals shall be adequately fed at intervals not to exceed twelve hours or shall be fed at least twice in any twenty-four hour period in quantities appropriate for the animal species and age, unless determined otherwise by and under the direction of a duly licensed veterinarian.\n      (c) Sanitary food receptacles shall be provided in sufficient number, size, and location as to enable each animal in the primary enclosure or cage to be supplied with an adequate amount of food.\n      (d) Animals shall be provided with constant access to clean, fresh water, supplied in a sanitary manner sufficient for its needs, except when there are instructions from a duly licensed veterinarian to withhold water for medical reasons.\n      4. Each animal shall be handled in a humane manner so as not to cause the animal physical injury, harm, or undue stress.\n      5.

For animals eighteen months of age or older, such examination shall include a diagnosis of any congenital conditions that adversely affect the health of the animal.  Any animal diagnosed with a contagious disease shall be treated and caged separately from healthy animals in the isolation area required pursuant to subparagraph (h) of paragraph one of subdivision a of section 17-1705 of this chapter.\n      (d) If an animal suffers from a congenital or hereditary condition, disease, or illness which, in the professional opinion of the pet shop's veterinarian, requires euthanasia, the veterinarian shall humanely euthanize such animal without undue delay.\n      (e) In the event an animal is returned to a pet shop due to a congenital or hereditary condition, illness, or disease requiring veterinary care, the pet shop shall, without undue delay, provide the animal with proper veterinary care.\n      6. No pet shop shall euthanize an animal except by humane euthanasia performed by a veterinarian duly licensed in the state of New York in accordance with section three hundred seventy four of the agriculture and markets law who has diagnosed such animal as requiring euthanasia due to a serious illness or injury.\n      7. Every pet shop shall develop, maintain, document, and implement an appropriate written plan to provide dogs with the opportunity for daily exercise.
