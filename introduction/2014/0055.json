Chapter 3 of title 17 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new subchapter 9 to read as follows:\r\n      Subchapter 9\r\n      PET SHOPS\r\n      \r\n�17-371 Definitions.\r\n�17-372 Pet shop permits required.\r\n�17-373 Permit applications.\r\n�17-374 Permit expiration dates; fees.\r\n�17-375 Permits not transferable; exception.\r\n�17-376 Conditions of permit and health code to be observed.\r\n�17-377 Permit to be kept on premises; mutilation prohibited.\r\n�17-378 Permit suspension and revocation.\r\n�17-379 Denial of issuance or renewal, suspension and revocation; when effective; service of order or notice.\r\n�17-380 Forfeiture and seizure.\r\n�17-381 Penalties.\r\n�17-382 Rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n      �17-371  Definitions.  For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings: \r\n      a. \"Arm's length transaction\" means a sale of a business for consideration that reflects the fair market value of such business or its assets, between two informed and willing parties, that is not made, wholly or in part, for the purpose of enabling the seller to avoid liability for violations issued by the department. A sale shall be presumed not to be an arm's length transaction if it is:\r\n      1. A sale to an individual, or to a corporation or other business that is owned by the spouse, domestic partner, parent, grandparent, child or stepchild of any of any of the sellers, or is the direct descendent of a grandparent, the spouse or domestic partner of any of the sellers;\r\n      2. A sale to an individual or entity that has a business or financial interest in the seller; or\r\n      3. A sale to an entity in which any of the sellers has a business or financial relationship.\r\n      b. \"Breeder\" shall have the same meaning as set forth in section 17-1701 of this title.\r\n      c. \"Permit\" means a written license and authorization to carry on specified activities as regulated by this subchapter or other applicable law enforced by the department.\r\n      d. \"Permittee\" means a natural person or other entity who holds a valid permit issued by the commissioner pursuant to this subchapter or other applicable law enforced by the department.\r\n      e. \"Person\" means any individual, corporation, partnership, association, municipality, or other legal entity.\r\n      f. \"Pet shop\" means a facility other than an animal shelter where live animals are sold, exchanged, bartered, or offered for sale as pet animals to the general public at retail for profit.  Such definition shall not include breeders who sell or offer to sell directly to consumers fewer than twenty-five dogs or cats per year that are born and raised on the breeder's residential premises.  Such definition shall not include duly incorporated humane societies dedicated to the care of unwanted animals that make such animals available for adoption, whether or not a fee for such adoption is charged.  A person who allows an animal shelter, animal rescue group or non-profit rescue group, as such terms are defined in section 17-1701 of chapter seventeen of this title, to use such person's premises for the purpose of making animals available for adoption shall not be deemed a pet shop as a result of such activity so long as such person does not have an ownership interest in any of the animals being made available for adoption, and does not derive a fee for providing such adoption services.    \r\n      �17-372  Pet shop permits required. a. No person shall operate a pet shop without a permit issued by the commissioner pursuant to this subchapter.  \r\n      b. Operating a business or conducting an activity regulated by this subchapter without the permit therefor is hereby declared a nuisance.\r\n      1. No person may operate a business or conduct an activity regulated by this subchapter without the permit required by this subchapter.\r\n      2. No person may allow the operation of a business or the conduct of an activity regulated by this subchapter in any property owned by such person unless the person operating such business or conducting such activity has a permit as required by this section.\r\n      3. When the department determines that a business or activity regulated by this subchapter is being operated or conducted without the permit required by this section, the commissioner or his or her designee may order the person operating the business or conducting the activity to cease and desist from such business or activity. The department may also order the person who owns the premises in which the business is operated or activity is conducted to take whatever action may be necessary to prohibit such business or activity from continuing on such premises.\r\n      4. If the business or activity ordered to cease and desist continues without the required permit, the commissioner or his or her designee may, after providing an opportunity for the person operating such business or conducting such activity to be heard at the environmental control board or any tribunal established within the office of administrative trials and hearings as designated by the commissioner, take any measure authorized by applicable law to enforce an order to cease and desist. Such measures may include, but are not limited to, ordering and arranging for the premises to be sealed and padlocked.\r\n      5. If the commissioner determines that exigent circumstances exist such that the continued operation of the business or activity would pose an danger to the public or the health and welfare of the animals in the custody of the business, the commissioner may take any measure authorized by applicable law to enforce an order to cease and desist, subject to a prompt post-enforcement hearing at the environmental control board or any tribunal established within the office of administrative trials and hearings as designated by the commissioner.  \r\n      �17-373  Permit applications. a. An application for a permit required pursuant to section 17-372 of this title or for the renewal of such a permit shall be made and submitted on forms furnished by the department. \r\n      b.

If the applicant is a partnership, the application shall be signed by a partner. If the applicant is a limited partnership, the application shall be signed by the managing or general partner. If the applicant is a corporation, the application shall be signed by an officer or director of the corporation or by any member, if management is vested in members. If the applicant is a limited liability company, the application shall be signed by any manager of the limited liability company. Such signature shall constitute an agreement that the permittee assumes responsibility for the conduct of the business, occupation or other activity concerned in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter or other applicable law.\r\n      d. In addition to the following information, the application shall be accompanied by such other information, evidence or documentation as the department may require or as may be provided for in this subchapter or other applicable law or rule applicable to the department. The application shall, at a minimum, include:\r\n      1. The name, age, gender, residence and business address, and telephone numbers of the applicant, each member of the partnership, limited liability company or group, and each officer of the corporation, as applicable;\r\n      2. To the extent that such information is relevant to the conduct of the business, trade, occupation or other activity under permit, information concerning the applicant, its individual members or officers, relating to education, training or experience, moral character, physical health, addiction to alcohol or habit-forming drugs, history of prior criminal conviction, including violations and offenses, history of mental illness, and record of insolvency or bankruptcy;\r\n      3.

The e-mail address of (i) the individual owner of the business, (ii) the person exercising daily management and control of the business, or (iii) the person who is authorized by law to accept service of process on behalf of the applicant; and\r\n      5. A certification, executed under penalty of perjury, that the applicant has not knowingly sold any animal obtained from a source prohibited pursuant to section 17-1702 of this title.  For an application submitted prior to June 1, 2017, such certification shall be made with respect to animals sold on or after June 1, 2015.  For applications submitted on or after June 1, 2017, such certification shall be made with respect to animals sold during the two years preceding the date of the application. \r\n      (a) A certification made by a pet shop pursuant to this paragraph shall be made in a form and manner determined by the department and shall include the following information:\r\n      (i) The name and address of every source from which such pet shop obtained a dog or cat during the relevant period;\r\n      (ii) The total number of dogs and cats obtained from each source; and  \r\n      (iii) If a source is a dealer, as such term is defined in section 17-1701 of this title: (A) the United States department of agriculture license number of such dealer; and (B) the individual identifying tag, tattoo, or collar number of each dog or cat obtained from such dealer.\r\n      (b) The department may promulgate rules for the production, receipt, acceptance, acquisition, recording, filing, transmission, forwarding, and storage of such certifications by use of electronic means.   \r\n      (c) The department may inspect the records maintained pursuant to section 17-1704 of this title.  \r\n      6. Any information that the department determines may be necessary in order to contact the permittee in the event of an emergency.\r\n      e. The commissioner shall not issue or renew a permit unless department records show there are no finally determined uncorrected violations or unpaid outstanding fines, penalties or forfeitures imposed by any court, administrative tribunal established within the office of administrative trials and hearings or administrative tribunal established in accordance with the administrative code or the charter, which are due and payable by the applicant or the permittee.\r\n      f. The commissioner shall not issue a new permit or renewal of an existing permit to any person listed on the animal abuse registry created pursuant to chapter sixteen of this title.\r\n      g. The commissioner shall not issue a new permit to any entity based on a sale or change of ownership of a permitted business or activity regulated by laws or rules enforced by the department, where department or other records show any finally determined uncorrected violations or unpaid fines and penalties, unless the applicant submits proof satisfactory to the department that the transfer of the business was the result of an arm's length transaction. Such proof shall consist of documents showing that:\r\n      1. The applicant has assumed complete management, control and operation of the permitted business or activity from the prior permittee;\r\n      2. The applicant has paid market value consideration for the material assets of the permitted business; and\r\n      3. Neither the applicant nor any member or officer of a partnership or corporation is related by blood or marriage to the owner(s) or manager(s) of the entity holding the permit prior to the transfer of the permitted business.\r\n      The commissioner's denial of an application pursuant to this subdivision shall be a final agency determination not subject to administrative appeal.\r\n      h. The acceptance of an application and fee for a new permit or the renewal of a permit shall not preclude the commissioner from taking any action that he or she deems necessary, including, but not limited to, the denial of a new permit or renewal permit if department or other investigatory or pre-permit inspections disclose conditions or circumstances indicating that a permit should not be issued or renewed. If an application for a new permit or renewal of an existing permit is denied, the application fee shall not be refunded.\r\n      �17-374  Permit expiration dates; fees. a. An application for a permit or for the renewal thereof shall be accompanied by the payment of a fee of three hundred dollars. Permits shall expire biennially and be eligible for renewal.\r\n      b. If a permit application is made when more than one-half of the fee period has expired, one-half of the prescribed fee shall be paid. This requirement shall not apply, however, if application is being made for renewal of a permit which has expired.\r\n      c. The fees provided for herein shall be reduced by the amount of any fee paid for a permit to operate a pet shop pursuant to the New York city health code within the same fee period.\r\n      �17-375  Permits not transferable; exception.  Any purported or attempted transfer of a permit to a person not named therein as permittee or any change in the place of business stated in a permit shall void such permit. When a permit is issued to two or more individuals, to a partnership or to a group other than a partnership, and one or more of the individuals concerned ceases to be active in the conduct of the business or activity or otherwise ceases to be a permittee, the commissioner may approve in writing the continuation of the business or activity by the remaining permittees during the unexpired period of such permit. The permittee shall notify the department in writing within ten business days of any change in the owner(s), officers, directors, shareholders, partners or members of a permitted entity that is owned by a sole proprietor, or that is a closely held corporation or small limited liability company, or a partnership, consisting of fewer than five shareholders, members or partners, who directly operate and manage the business, and serve as directors or officers of the corporation, with no outside investors. Notice of such changes shall not be required if the permittee is a publicly held corporation or limited liability company whose shareholders or members do not manage or control the entity or participate in its business activities.\r\n      �17-376  Conditions of permit and health code to be observed. a. A person holding a permit, including the officers and directors of a corporation holding a permit, shall comply with the conditions contained in his or her permit as well as all applicable provisions of the New York city health code, administrative code or other law or rule enforced by the department.\r\n      b.

A permit shall be kept on the premises designated on the permit. It shall be placed in a clean, transparent cover or frame and displayed in such a manner as to be clearly visible to the public. It shall be available for inspection at all times by the department. No person shall mutilate, obstruct or tear down a permit.\r\n      �17-378  Permit suspension and revocation. a. In addition to any of the powers that may be exercised by the commissioner pursuant to this subchapter or this title, the rules promulgated thereunder, or the New York city health code, the commissioner, after due notice and an opportunity to be heard by the environmental control board or any tribunal established within the office of administrative trials and hearings as designated by the commissioner, may suspend or revoke a pet shop permit upon the occurrence of any one or more of the following conditions:\r\n      1. Willful or continued violation of the provisions of title seventeen of this code, the rules promulgated thereunder or the New York city health code, or for such other reason as the commissioner determines, is sufficient grounds for suspension or revocation;\r\n      2. The giving or offering to an employee or agent of the department or other government agency, engaged in carrying out an inspection, survey or examination or in the performance of any other duty for the department or such agency, a gift, gratuity, benefit, favor or bribe, including but not limited to money, food, or drink;\r\n      3. Submission or display by a permittee of a forged document or other document that contains false or misleading statements, or making a false or misleading statement to the department; or\r\n      4. Poor moral character that adversely reflects on the permittee's fitness to conduct work regulated by this title.\r\n      b. Notwithstanding subdivision a of this section, if the commissioner determines that exigent circumstances exist such that the continued operation of a permittee's pet shop would pose a danger to the public or the health and welfare of the animals in the permittee's custody, the commissioner may suspend such permittee's permit subject to a prompt post-suspension hearing before the environmental control board or any tribunal established within the office of administrative trials and hearings as designated by the commissioner.  \r\n      c. Following a hearing required pursuant to this section and the receipt of a copy of the report and recommendations of the tribunal before which such hearing was held, the commissioner may take such action as may be necessary, adopting all or part of the report and recommendations, and may issue an order revoking the permit, further suspending the permit, or reinstating the permit subject to whatever conditions the commissioner deems necessary for the continued safe operation of the permitted business.\r\n      d. All permits revoked pursuant to this section or in accordance with other applicable law shall be surrendered to the department upon receipt of the order. Permits or licenses that are not surrendered in accordance with this section may be seized by any authorized employee or agent of the department or officer of the police department.\r\n      �17-379  Denial of issuance or renewal, suspension and revocation; when effective; service of order or notice. a.

Any animal in a pet shop operating without a permit required pursuant to section 17-372 of this subchapter or seized pursuant to subdivision a of this section shall be subject to forfeiture upon notice and hearing. \r\n      c. The commissioner shall provide for the appropriate disposition of each animal seized pursuant to this section.  Such disposition may include impoundment at an animal shelter or non-profit rescue as such terms are defined in section 17-1701 of chapter seventeen of this title.  \r\n      d.  The commissioner may impose upon the owner of a pet shop from which an animal is seized pursuant to this section a fee representing expenses incurred in connection with impounding such animal.   \r\n      �17-381  Penalties. Any person found in violation of any provision of this subchapter or any provision of any rule promulgated thereunder shall be subject to a civil penalty of five hundred dollars per day for each such violation.  Each violation in connection with the sale of more than one animal shall be deemed a separate violation with respect to each animal offered for sale.  A notice of violation served pursuant to this section shall be returnable at the environmental control board or any tribunal established within the office of administrative trials and hearings as designated by the commissioner.\r\n      �17-382  Rules.  The commissioner may promulgate such rules and prescribe such forms as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this subchapter.\r\n      � 2.

If drains are used they shall be constructed in a manner to minimize foul odors and backup of sewage. If a drainage system is used it shall comply with federal, state, and local laws relating to pollution control.\r\n      (g) In the event that a pet shop has a pregnant or nursing dog on its premises, the pet shop shall provide a whelping box for such dog.

The location of such designated area must be such as to prevent or reduce the spread of disease to healthy animals.\r\n      2. Housing facilities, including primary enclosures and cages, shall be kept in a clean condition in order to maintain a safe and healthy environment for the animal. Such maintenance shall include removing and destroying any agents injurious to the health of the animal.\r\n      (a) Primary enclosures shall be cleaned on a daily basis.  \r\n      (b) Primary enclosures shall be sanitized at least once every two weeks using one of the following methods:\r\n      (i) live steam under pressure; or\r\n      (ii) washing with soap or detergent and water with a temperature of at least one hundred eighty degrees Fahrenheit; or\r\n      (iii) washing all soiled surfaces with appropriate detergent solutions and disinfectant or by using a combination detergent or disinfectant product that accomplishes the same purpose with a thorough cleaning of the surfaces to remove excreta, feces, hair, dirt, debris and food waste so as to remove all organic and mineral buildup and to provide sanitization, \tfollowed by a clean water rinse.\r\n      (c) Under no circumstances shall the animal remain inside the primary enclosure or cage while it is being cleaned with sterilizing agents or agents toxic to animals or cleaned in a manner likely to threaten the health and safety of the animal.  \r\n      (d) Trash and waste products on the premises shall be properly contained and disposed of so as to minimize the risks of disease, contamination, and vermin.\r\n      3. (a) Animals shall be provided with wholesome and palatable food, free from contamination and having nutritional value sufficient to maintain each animal in good health.\r\n      (b) Animals shall be adequately fed at intervals not to exceed twelve hours or shall be fed at least twice in any twenty-four hour period in quantities appropriate for the animal species and age, unless determined otherwise by and under the direction of a duly licensed veterinarian.\r\n      (c) Sanitary food receptacles shall be provided in sufficient number, size, and location as to enable each animal in the primary enclosure or cage to be supplied with an adequate amount of food.\r\n      (d) Animals shall be provided with constant access to clean, fresh water, supplied in a sanitary manner sufficient for its needs, except when there are instructions from a duly licensed veterinarian to withhold water for medical reasons.\r\n      4. Each animal shall be handled in a humane manner so as not to cause the animal physical injury, harm, or undue stress.\r\n      5. (a) Every pet shop shall designate an attending veterinarian, who shall provide veterinary care to the pet shop's animals which shall include a written program of veterinary care and regular visits to the pet shop's premises.

Each animal shall be observed each day by the pet shop, or by a person working under such pet shop's supervision.\r\n      (c) Within five business days of receipt, but prior to sale of any dog or cat, the pet shop shall have a duly licensed veterinarian conduct an examination and tests appropriate to the age and breed to determine if the animal has any medical conditions apparent at the time of the examination that adversely affect the health of the animal.  For animals eighteen months of age or older, such examination shall include a diagnosis of any congenital conditions that adversely affect the health of the animal.  Any animal diagnosed with a contagious disease shall be treated and caged separately from healthy animals in the isolation area required pursuant to subparagraph (h) of paragraph one of subdivision a of section 17-1705 of this chapter.\r\n      (d) If an animal suffers from a congenital or hereditary condition, disease, or illness which, in the professional opinion of the pet shop's veterinarian, requires euthanasia, the veterinarian shall humanely euthanize such animal without undue delay.\r\n      (e) In the event an animal is returned to a pet shop due to a congenital or hereditary condition, illness, or disease requiring veterinary care, the pet shop shall, without undue delay, provide the animal with proper veterinary care.\r\n      6. No pet shop shall euthanize an animal except by humane euthanasia performed by a veterinarian duly licensed in the state of New York in accordance with section three hundred seventy four of the agriculture and markets law who has diagnosed such animal as requiring euthanasia due to a serious illness or injury.\r\n      7. Every pet shop shall develop, maintain, document, and implement an appropriate written plan to provide dogs with the opportunity for daily exercise. In developing such plan, consideration shall be given to providing positive physical contact with humans that encourages exercise through play or other similar activities.
