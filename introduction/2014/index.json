Additionally, some of the demographic and other information would only be culled only from persons who are involved in certain DOHMH-operated or contracted programs or a Council-funded program. Annual reports would be submitted to the Council and available on DOHMH’s website.","LastModified":"2017-10-23T13:14:34.027Z"}

Any building in the City where there has been a final determination of harassment by New York state homes and community renewal (HCR) or any court with jurisdiction five years prior to the enactment date will automatically be denied a CONH should they apply for a permit with DOB. Buildings where a full vacate order has been issued and buildings where there has been active participation in the alternative enforcement program (AEP) will be required to apply for the CONH for covered work. In districts that have undergone city-sponsored neighborhood-wide rezonings and community districts that indicate significant distress based on numerous factors, including changes of ownerships, certain buildings that meet a Building Qualification Index (BQI) will also be required to apply for the CONH for covered work. \r\n\r\nIf harassment is found after an investigation by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) and community groups, where designated by HPD, the owner must provide for affordable housing. Within such building, at least 25% of the total residential floor area of such building must be affordable, and if it is a new building, then 20% of the total floor area of a new building on the lot containing the building must be affordable.

The New York City Department of Transportation (DOT) and Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) collaborate on a version of BRT called Select Bus Service (SBS), with eight lines implemented since June 2008.\r\n\r\nUnder the bill, DOT would work with the MTA and gather input with the public to develop a citywide BRT plan, due to the Council no later than September 1, 2017. The plan would consider areas of the City in need of additional rapid transit options, strategies for serving growing neighborhoods, potential intra-borough and inter-borough BRT corridors DOT plans to establish by 2027, strategies for integrating BRT with other transit routes, and the anticipated operating costs of additional BRT lines.\t Additionally, DOT would be required to update the Council on the implementation of the plan every two years, through 2027.","LastModified":"2017-10-13T19:12:26.91Z"}

APS generally provide information to pedestrians about the existence and location of the pushbutton, the beginning of the “WALK” interval, the direction of the crosswalk, and location of the destination curb. In 2012, the Council enacted a local law requiring the New York City Department of Transportation (“DOT”) to establish an APS program and annually install accessible pedestrian signals at each corner of 25 identified intersections. The bill would increase the minimum number of intersections at which DOT must install an APS to 75.","LastModified":"2015-12-02T19:36:02.443Z"}

The bill also makes the penalties for failing to clear snow from such area consistent with the penalties for failing to clear snow from a sidewalk.  It also removes the criminal penalties for failure to remove snow from sidewalks.","LastModified":"2017-01-18T21:21:20.117Z"}

This bill would establish a separate Department of Veterans Affairs (the “Department”), headed by a Commissioner of Veterans Affairs. The bill would provide the Department with the responsibility to cooperate with federal, state, and local agencies and to inform and assist members of the armed forces and veterans, and their families in matters relating to: educational training and retraining services and facilities; health, medical, and rehabilitation services and facilities; provisions of federal, state, and local laws and regulations giving special rights and privileges to members of the armed forces, veterans, and their families; employment and re-employment services; and other appropriate matters.\r\n\r\nThe Office of Veterans Affairs is currently advised by a Veterans Advisory Board comprised of nine members (five appointment by the mayor and four appointed by the speaker of the City Council), all of whom are veterans. This bill requires the Veterans Advisory Board to advise the commissioner on all matters concerning veterans, as well as keeping the requirements that they meet quarterly, keep records of meetings, and submit an annual report of their activities to the mayor and the council on or before December 31 of each year.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this bill amends the New York City Administrative Code to require the Department to publish information on its website concerning resources intended to assist veterans in obtaining employment, and to consult with city agencies to identify job postings for inclusion on the Federal veterans’ job bank. Finally, the bill requires each city agency to designate an employee to act as a liaison with veterans within the agency, and the Department to provide periodic training to the veterans’ liaisons, as well as to post on its website the names of the liaisons at each city agency.","LastModified":"2017-05-04T20:01:26.133Z"}

The semi-annual reporting would include data on the number of registration forms distributed and mailed to the Board of Elections. It would go to the Mayor’s Office of Operations, which would consolidate the reports into a single report that it would submit to the Speaker.","LastModified":"2018-02-21T16:40:07.39Z"}

The bill would require the DOE to report: the number of guidance counselors in each school; the guidance counselor to student ratio in each school; whether the guidance counselor is providing counseling assistance to more than one co-located school in a school building; and the number of students served by each guidance counselor and the nature and scope of the counseling received by each student, including academic counseling, college preparatory and career counseling. This bill would also require the annual reports to include the number of guidance counselors in the absent teacher reserve pool, information regarding the DOE’s efforts to recruit guidance counselors for grades seven through twelve, and information on any guidance memorandums issued by the DOE regarding college preparedness. This bill also would require the reports to include demographic information for students in each school, including race, ethnicity, English language learner status, special education status, and the percentage of students eligible for free and reduced price lunch.","LastModified":"2016-11-17T21:07:45.07Z"}

They attract refuse and graffiti, and obstruct pedestrian traffic. Currently, the Department of Sanitation (“DSNY”) is authorized to remove any collection bin placed on City property 30 days after notice has been affixed to the collection bin. Recently, however, the number of collection bins on City property has greatly increased. Collection bin providers have learned they can simply move their collection bin to another location on City property before 30 days has elapsed.\r\n\r\nThe bill would allow DSNY to immediately remove a collection bin placed on City property, or property maintained by the City, or on any public sidewalk or roadway. If the owner’s name and address are located on the collection bin, DSNY will provide notice to the owner that it has removed the bin and that the owner can claim such collection bin through procedures to be established by rule. The bill establishes civil penalties for collection bins placed on City property and for attaching or enclosing a bin on City property. An owner who seeks to reclaim a collection bin that has been removed by DSNY will be required to pay any penalties imposed and the costs of removal and storage. If the owner does not claim his or her collection bin within 30 days, the department can dispose of it. For bins on private property, both the owner of the bin and the owner of the property will be responsible for maintaining the bin in a clean and neat condition and for reporting the amount of material collected on a yearly basis to DSNY.","LastModified":"2015-12-02T20:05:35.463Z"}

The Department of Housing Preservation and Development, the Department of Buildings, the Fire Department and the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene would all be required to enforce this bill.","LastModified":"2015-12-30T16:51:37.09Z"}

A traffic calming device is defined by the statute and includes, but is not limited to, tools such as speed humps, curb extensions, traffic diverters, median barriers, and raised walkways. Such devices are installed on a street and are intended to slow, reduce, or alter motor vehicle traffic to improve safety for pedestrians and bicyclists. Currently, the Department is required to consider locations such as schools, senior centers, and nursing homes.\r\n\r\nThis bill would require the Department to annually install at least one traffic calming device on no less than fifty blocks that are adjacent to senior centers or naturally occurring retirement communities (NORCs). The Commissioner of the Department, after evaluating all of these locations, may determine to stop further installation (consistent with the Commissioner’s right to decline to install a device if they determine that doing so would endanger the safety of motorists or pedestrians, or would be noncompliant with the Department’s traffic control device guidelines), but only upon informing the Speaker of the City Council of the reasons for their determination. Any senior center or NORC created after such a determination must be evaluated for placement of a traffic calming device. The Department is further required to report to the Council on July 1, 2015 and annually thereafter on the locations where traffic calming devices have been installed.","LastModified":"2017-12-22T02:16:40.053Z"}

In order to convert additional hotel space, a hotel owner would have to apply to the Hotel Conversion Review Board, created by this bill, for a waiver and would have to demonstrate that the hotel was unable to earn a reasonable financial return. The Board would evaluate relevant financial information relating to the hotel and hold a public hearing with respect to each application for a waiver. If the Board found that the hotel was unable to earn a reasonable financial return, it would be authorized to allow the owner to convert additional hotel space for other uses to the minimum extent necessary to allow the hotel to earn a reasonable return. The waiver procedure would first become available 180 days after this bill became law.","LastModified":"2021-08-18T20:00:44.043Z"}

This report must include information regarding a body-worn camera program: its cost, privacy implications, best practices regarding data storage, when such cameras must be recording and when they may be switched off, evidentiary issues involved in using such footage, and any other recommendations the task force believes will assist in implementing a body-worn camera program.","LastModified":"2019-11-06T21:27:11.073Z"}
