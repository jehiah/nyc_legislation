This bill would establish a separate Department of Veterans Affairs (the “Department”), headed by a Commissioner of Veterans Affairs. The bill would provide the Department with the responsibility to cooperate with federal, state, and local agencies and to inform and assist members of the armed forces and veterans, and their families in matters relating to: educational training and retraining services and facilities; health, medical, and rehabilitation services and facilities; provisions of federal, state, and local laws and regulations giving special rights and privileges to members of the armed forces, veterans, and their families; employment and re-employment services; and other appropriate matters.\r\n\r\nThe Office of Veterans Affairs is currently advised by a Veterans Advisory Board comprised of nine members (five appointment by the mayor and four appointed by the speaker of the City Council), all of whom are veterans. This bill requires the Veterans Advisory Board to advise the commissioner on all matters concerning veterans, as well as keeping the requirements that they meet quarterly, keep records of meetings, and submit an annual report of their activities to the mayor and the council on or before December 31 of each year.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this bill amends the New York City Administrative Code to require the Department to publish information on its website concerning resources intended to assist veterans in obtaining employment, and to consult with city agencies to identify job postings for inclusion on the Federal veterans’ job bank. Finally, the bill requires each city agency to designate an employee to act as a liaison with veterans within the agency, and the Department to provide periodic training to the veterans’ liaisons, as well as to post on its website the names of the liaisons at each city agency.","LastModified":"2017-05-04T20:01:26.133Z"}

They attract refuse and graffiti, and obstruct pedestrian traffic. Currently, the Department of Sanitation (“DSNY”) is authorized to remove any collection bin placed on City property 30 days after notice has been affixed to the collection bin. Recently, however, the number of collection bins on City property has greatly increased. Collection bin providers have learned they can simply move their collection bin to another location on City property before 30 days has elapsed.\r\n\r\nThe bill would allow DSNY to immediately remove a collection bin placed on City property, or property maintained by the City, or on any public sidewalk or roadway. If the owner’s name and address are located on the collection bin, DSNY will provide notice to the owner that it has removed the bin and that the owner can claim such collection bin through procedures to be established by rule. The bill establishes civil penalties for collection bins placed on City property and for attaching or enclosing a bin on City property. An owner who seeks to reclaim a collection bin that has been removed by DSNY will be required to pay any penalties imposed and the costs of removal and storage. If the owner does not claim his or her collection bin within 30 days, the department can dispose of it. For bins on private property, both the owner of the bin and the owner of the property will be responsible for maintaining the bin in a clean and neat condition and for reporting the amount of material collected on a yearly basis to DSNY.","LastModified":"2015-12-02T20:05:35.463Z"}

A traffic calming device is defined by the statute and includes, but is not limited to, tools such as speed humps, curb extensions, traffic diverters, median barriers, and raised walkways. Such devices are installed on a street and are intended to slow, reduce, or alter motor vehicle traffic to improve safety for pedestrians and bicyclists.

The Commissioner of the Department, after evaluating all of these locations, may determine to stop further installation (consistent with the Commissioner’s right to decline to install a device if they determine that doing so would endanger the safety of motorists or pedestrians, or would be noncompliant with the Department’s traffic control device guidelines), but only upon informing the Speaker of the City Council of the reasons for their determination. Any senior center or NORC created after such a determination must be evaluated for placement of a traffic calming device. The Department is further required to report to the Council on July 1, 2015 and annually thereafter on the locations where traffic calming devices have been installed.","LastModified":"2017-12-22T02:16:40.053Z"}
