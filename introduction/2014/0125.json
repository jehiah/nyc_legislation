  "Summary": "This local law would require car washes in New York City to operate under a license and carry an indemnity bond in the amount of $150,000, or $30,000 if the car wash is a party to a collective bargaining agreement or government supervised settlement. The bond may be used to collect judgments against a car wash for wage and hour violations. The license fee would be $550 biennially.",

The term \"licensee\" means any individual, partnership, corporation, limited liability company, joint venture, association or other business entity that is currently licensed by the commissioner to engage in the operation of a car wash.\n      � 20-541 License. a.
