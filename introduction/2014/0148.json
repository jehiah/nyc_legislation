  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n      Section 1. Legislative findings. Under current law, disclosure on independent expenditure advertisements includes only the name of the individual or organization responsible for the advertisement. Many independent expenditure-making organizations in the 2013 election cycle, however, had generic names that told voters little about who or what the organizations represented, obscuring the actual sources of the spending and making it difficult for voters to evaluate the arguments in election-related advertisements. Requiring the inclusion of the names of donors to these organizations within such advertisements, and linking to a website with more detailed information, will alleviate this problem in a targeted way by enhancing voters' understanding of the interests and individuals whose financial support substantially enabled the creation of such advertisements. The Council therefore finds that it has an interest in promoting transparency by ensuring that the electorate has sufficient information and that voters are informed about the sources of spending related to local elections, and that this legislation is substantially related to such interest.\n      �2. Subparagraph (b) of paragraph 15 of subdivision a of section 1052 of the New York city charter, as added by vote of the electors of the city of New York at a general election held on November 2, 2010, is amended to read as follows:\n\t(b) Every individual and entity that makes independent expenditures aggregating one thousand dollars or more in support of or in opposition to any candidate in any covered election, or in support of or in opposition to any municipal ballot proposal or referendum, shall be required to disclose such expenditure to the board. In addition, every entity that, in the twelve months preceding a covered election, makes independent expenditures aggregating five thousand dollars or more in support of or in opposition to any candidate in any covered election shall disclose the following: (i) the identity of any entity that, on or after the first day of the calendar year preceding the covered election, contributed to the entity reporting the expenditure, and the owners, partners, board members, and officers, or their equivalents, of such contributing entity, or, if no individuals exist in any such roles, the name of at least one individual who exercises control over the activities of such contributing entity; (ii) the identity of any entity or individual who, in the twelve months preceding the covered election, contributed twenty-five thousand dollars or more to any entity that, in the twelve months preceding the covered election, contributed fifty thousand dollars or more to the entity reporting the expenditure; and (iii) the identity of any individual who, in the twelve months preceding the covered election, contributed one thousand dollars or more to the entity reporting the expenditure. \n      �3. Subparagraph (c) of paragraph 15 of subdivision a of section 1052 of the New York city charter, as added by vote of the electors of the city of New York at a general election held on November 2, 2010, is amended to read as follows:\n\t(c) Any literature, advertisement or other communication in support of or in opposition to any candidate in any covered election that is paid for by an individual or entity making independent expenditures aggregating one thousand dollars or more shall, in addition to any applicable disclosure requirements in state law, disclose [the name of any individual or entity making the expenditure] information as follows:\n      (i) on any written, typed, or printed communication, or on any internet text or graphical advertisement, in a conspicuous size and style, the words \"Paid for by\" followed by the name of the individual or the name of the entity, the name of its owner, if any, and the name of its chief executive officer or equivalent, if any, and, following the words \"Top Three Donors,\" a list of the three largest aggregate donors to such entity in the twelve months preceding the election, except that no donor that contributed less than five thousand dollars to the disclosing entity in the twelve months preceding the election shall be included in such disclosure, and except that if such entity has only one or two donors that contributed at least five thousand dollars the words \"Top Three Donors\" shall be replaced by the words \"Top Donor\" or \"Top Donors\" as applicable, and except that expenditures funded by an individual or where no such donors exist need not include the words \"Top Three Donors\" or a list of donors, and except that this clause shall not apply to communications required to include a disclosure pursuant to subdivision sixteen of section 3-703 of the administrative code. If the third largest donor to the disclosing entity has donated the same amount in the twelve months preceding the election as the fourth largest donor during such period, such entity may choose which three donors to include so long as no donor is included that has donated less in the twelve months preceding the election than any other donor that is not included. Such written disclosures shall further include, in a conspicuous size and style, the following words: \"More information at nyc.gov/FollowTheMoney.\" The board may, at its discretion, designate a website other than nyc.gov/FollowTheMoney as the website that must be included in such disclosure. All disclosures required by this clause shall be enclosed in a box within the borders of the communication or advertisement that contains only those disclosures required by this subparagraph, the rules of the board, the election law, or any other applicable law or rule. For the purposes of this clause, the \"owner\" of an entity shall be an individual or entity with a greater than fifty percent ownership interest in such entity.

Legislative findings. Under current law, disclosure on independent expenditure advertisements includes only the name of the individual or organization responsible for the advertisement. Many independent expenditure-making organizations in the 2013 election cycle, however, had generic names that told voters little about who or what the organizations represented, obscuring the actual sources of the spending and making it difficult for voters to evaluate the arguments in election-related advertisements. Requiring the inclusion of the names of donors to these organizations within such advertisements, and linking to a website with more detailed information, will alleviate this problem in a targeted way by enhancing voters\\rquote  understanding of the interests and individuals whose financial support substantially enabled the creation of such advertisements. The Council therefore finds that it has an interest in promoting transparency by ensuring that the electorate has sufficient information and that voters are informed about the sources of spending related to local elections, and that this legislation is substantially related to such interest.\\par\n\\'a72.
