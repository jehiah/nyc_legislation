The Council finds that the reduction of greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming is critical to the current and future prosperity of New York City. The Council further finds that in view of the rapid progress of climate change events and indicators and in order to increase the effectiveness of New York City measures intended to prepare for and alter the course of adverse climate change impacts on New York City's critical infrastructure and vulnerable citizens, and consistent with the spirit of PlaNYC 2030 and the New York City Climate Protection Act, Local Law 22 of 2008, the reduction of emissions citywide should be increased from a thirty percent reduction in citywide emissions by calendar year 2030, relative to such emissions for the base year, to an eighty percent reduction in citywide greenhouse gas emissions relative to such emissions for the base year by calendar year 2050. \n\tTherefore, the Council finds that it is in the best interests of the City to provide for an increase in future reductions in citywide greenhouse gas emissions.\n\t� 2. Subdivision a of section 24-803 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\n\t�24-803 Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming. a. (1) Reduction of emissions citywide. There shall be, at minimum, a thirty percent reduction in citywide emissions by calendar year 2030, and an eighty percent reduction in citywide emissions by calendar year 2050, relative to such emissions for the base year for citywide emissions.\n\t(2) The emissions reduction required by paragraph one of this subdivision shall be achieved through the applicable policies, programs and actions included in PlaNYC, the long-term sustainability plan developed and updated pursuant to section twenty of the New York city charter, and any additional policies, programs and actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming. If the office determines that such emissions reduction is not feasible despite the best efforts of city government, such office shall report such findings and make recommendations with respect to policies, programs and actions that may be undertaken to achieve such reductions.\n\t� 3.This local law shall take effect immediately.\nLS # 1557  SS\n6/3/14 10:27 a.m.",
