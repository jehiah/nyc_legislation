  "Summary": "This bill would require every City agency to appoint a cultural liaison to advise the agency on how to best facilitate arts programming and coordinate with cultural institutions. The cultural liaisons would coordinate with the Department of Cultural Affairs (DCLA) and incorporate the arts in the City agencies. The bill would also require every City agency to create a plan to implement the duties of the cultural liaisons that would be submitted to the Speaker of the City Council and the Commissioner of DCLA. The bill would require DCLA to designate a liaison tasked with developing and overseeing cultural programming in New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) developments and designate a liaison tasked with working with the Department of Education to help develop artistic and cultural programming in New York City public schools.",
