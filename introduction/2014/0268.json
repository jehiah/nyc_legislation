  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n      Section 1. Statement of findings and purpose. While sidewalk sheds protect pedestrians during the construction, maintenance and inspection of buildings, they can cause considerable damage to trees.  Each year, the Department of Buildings issues tens of thousands of buildings permits for new construction and building renovations and Local Law 11 of 1998 requires the erection of scaffolding and sidewalk sheds to perform fa�ade inspections and maintenance.  Unfortunately, sidewalk sheds can damage and even kill trees. Sidewalk sheds cast shade over sidewalk trees, prevent rainwater from reaching tree roots and damage tree crowns. The installation of sidewalk sheds or other construction activity can damage tree leaders (the main vertical limb), resulting in permanent deformation of trees so that the tree no longer grows vertically.  Broken side branches that are not removed with clean cuts provide avenues for diseases and can eventually cause the demise of trees.\n      � 2.  Section  3307.6.4 of the New York city building code, as added by local law number 33 for the year 2007, is amended by adding a new item 10 to read as follows:\n10.  The construction of sidewalk sheds within 10 feet (3.048m) of a tree within the public right of way shall be in accordance with the provisions of Section  3309.11.\n      � 3.
