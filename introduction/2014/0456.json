  "Summary": "This bill would require the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings to issue a monthly report analyzing the civil violations dismissed in its tribunals. The report would be required to include the applicable agency and reason for dismissal for each violation. This report would be sent to, among others, the agencies whose violations were dismissed. This bill would also require these same agencies to work with the Mayor’s Office of Operations to prepare a one-time report documenting each agency’s planned steps to minimize the issuance of violations that are ultimately dismissed.",
