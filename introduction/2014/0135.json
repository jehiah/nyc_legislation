This bill would expand this reporting to include all categories of medical emergencies, and require more detailed reporting on response times to serious medical emergencies and fires. The current law requires this reporting to be disaggregated by borough, this bill would also require the FDNY to disaggregate by community district and division.","TextID":60079,"Text":"Int.
