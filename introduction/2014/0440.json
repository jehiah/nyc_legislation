  "Summary": "This bill would require quarterly reporting from the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) that includes any physical or mental health performance indicators reported to them by any healthcare provider in jails. This information is currently provided to DOHMH by the provider at the Rikers Island jail complex pursuant to contract. This bill would require that the Council and Mayor receive these reports, and that they are posted online. Even if no performance indicators were reported to DOHMH by a healthcare provider at City jails, DOHMH would be required to issue a quarterly report covering five areas of inmate health—intake, follow-up care, patient safety, preventable hospitalizations, and preventable errors in medical care.",
