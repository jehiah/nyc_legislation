  "Summary": "This bill would amend the Animal Shelters and Sterilization Act to prohibit the sale of any dog or cat in any pet store unless such animal has been spayed or neutered. It would require that such procedures be performed by a licensed veterinarian and that the animals be no younger than eight weeks and weigh no less than two pounds.\r\n\r\nThe bill would also prohibit a pet shop from releasing any dog to a customer who resides in New York City, unless such customer first completes a dog license application and tenders to the pet store the dog license application fee. Pet shops would be required to report information about all dogs sold to the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene on a monthly basis.\r\n\r\nA pet shop that violates the provisions of this law related to sterilization and dog licensing, or the provisions of law added by Proposed Int. No. 146-A related to microchipping, would be subject to a penalty of $500 per violation.",
