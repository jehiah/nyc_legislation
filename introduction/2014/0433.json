  "Summary": "Every day approximately seven children are treated in hospital emergency rooms for injuries caused by tampering with a wall outlet. This bill would require the owners of multiple dwellings to install and maintain protective devices over electrical outlets in common areas of the building that are accessible to children or pets. Failure to install or maintain these protective devices would result in a class B hazardous violation. The Department of Housing Preservation and Development, the Department of Buildings, the Fire Department and the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene would all be required to enforce this bill.",
