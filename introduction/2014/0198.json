Under the bill, all large vehicles in the City fleet and City-licensed trade waste hauling vehicles weighing over 10,000 pounds would be required to have side guards by January 1, 2024. Specialized vehicles on which side guard installation is impractical would be exempt from the requirement. Owners or operators of trade waste hauling vehicles that fail to install side guards would be subject to penalties of $10,000 per vehicle and license revocation or denial.","TextID":56125,"Text":"Int.
