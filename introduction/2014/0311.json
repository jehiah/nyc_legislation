Subchapter one of chapter one of title 19 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 19-156 to read as follows:\n\t�19-156 Study of alternative materials to repair street defects.  The department and the department of environmental protection shall conduct a study on the possible use of technologies for repair of street defects that are more environmentally sustainable.  Such study shall include the following: (i) various types of environmentally sustainable materials that may be used to repair street defects, including but not limited to those with recycled content; (ii) the expected costs of such materials and the projected feasibility of using such materials, including but not limited to availability, durability, operational function and performance; (iii) the volume of such materials anticipated to be used for such repair as compared to the volume of materials currently used to repair such defects; (iv) recommendations and limitations regarding the use of such materials on roadways under the jurisdiction of the department; (v) the effect on utilities and other entities that will need to make cuts in roadways; and (vi) a determination on whether a uniform standard on the use of environmentally sustainable materials in roadways within the city of New York is appropriate, based on the results of the study required pursuant to this section. If such uniform standards are deemed appropriate, the department, in consultation with other agencies including but not limited to the department of design and construction, shall make recommendations and exceptions to such uniform standard.  Such study shall be completed and delivered to the speaker of the council and posted on the department's website not more than twelve months following the effective date of the local law that added this section.\n\t� 2.
