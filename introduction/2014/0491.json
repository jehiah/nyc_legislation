Such practitioners must be licensed to practice in the United States, and must include a declaration under penalty of perjury that the professional is licensed and in good standing and that the applicant’s requested correction of sex designation more accurately reflects the applicant’s sex or gender identity.","TextID":55171,"Text":"Int.
