  "Summary": "The New York City Health Code currently allows individuals to change the gender designation on their birth certificate if they have obtained a court order changing his or her name and undergone “convertive surgery.” This bill would allow individuals to change such gender designation by having a medical or mental health professional fill out an affidavit or affirmation attesting that the changed sex designation more accurately reflects the applicant's sex gender identity.\r\n\r\nThe licensed professionals allowed to make such attestations would be as follows: physicians, doctoral level psychologists in clinical or counseling psychology, clinical social workers, master social workers, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, marriage and family therapists, mental health counselors or midwives. Such practitioners must be licensed to practice in the United States, and must include a declaration under penalty of perjury that the professional is licensed and in good standing and that the applicant’s requested correction of sex designation more accurately reflects the applicant’s sex or gender identity.",
