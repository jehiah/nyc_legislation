  "Summary": "The bill requires the Environmental Justice (EJ) Interagency Working Group (IWG), as put forth by Proposed Int. No. 886-A, to conduct a comprehensive EJ Study identifying the locations and boundaries of EJ areas within the City, describing environmental concerns affecting these areas and identifying data, studies, programs and other resources that are available and that may be used to advance EJ goals. The bill requires the IWG to issue recommendations for legislation, policy, budget initiatives and other measures to address environmental concerns affecting EJ communities. The bill also requires the IWG to make publicly available online an interactive map showing the boundaries of EJ areas within the City and the locations of sites, facilities and infrastructure which may raise environmental concerns. Finally, the bill requires the Administration to create an Environmental Justice Portal on the City’s website, providing easy access to EJ resources including relevant maps, data, studies and information about Agency programs.",
