Section 27-2115 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new subdivision o to read as follows:\n      (o) (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when the department serves a notice of violation to correct and certify a condition that constitutes a violation of article four of subchapter two of this chapter, the notice of violation shall specify the date by which the violation shall be corrected as provided  in such article, and the procedure by which the owner, for good cause shown pursuant to this subdivision, may request a postponement. The notice of violation shall further specify that the violation shall be corrected in accordance with section 27-2017.8 and the rules established pursuant to section 27-2017.9, where applicable. The notice of violation shall be served by personal delivery to a person in charge of the premises or to the person last registered with the department as the owner or agent, or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or by certified mail with proof of delivery, to the person in charge of the premises or to the person last registered with the department as the owner or agent; provided that where a managing agent has registered with the department, such notice of violation shall be served on the managing agent. Service of the notice of violation shall be deemed completed five days from the date of mailing. Notification, in a form to be determined by the department, of the issuance of such violation shall be sent simultaneously by regular mail to the occupant at the dwelling unit that is the subject of such notice of violation. \n      (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the notice of violation shall direct that the correction of each violation cited therein shall be certified to the department. Such certification shall be made in writing or electronically, under oath by the registered owner, a registered officer or director of a corporate owner or by the registered managing agent. Such certification shall include a statement that the violation was corrected in compliance with section 27-2017.8, where applicable, and the rules established pursuant to section 27-2017.9, where applicable. All certifications shall be delivered to the department and acknowledgment of receipt therefore obtained or shall be mailed to the department by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, no later than five days after the date set for correction, or submitted electronically within five days after the date set for correction, and shall include the date when each violation was corrected. Such certification of correction shall be supported by a sworn statement saying that the violation was properly corrected by the person who performed the work if performed by an employee or agent of the owner. Notification of such certification shall be mailed to the complainant by the department not more than twelve full calendar days from the date of receipt of such certification by the department. Failure to file such certification shall establish a prima facie case that such violation has not been corrected.\n      (3) Whenever the department shall issue a notice of violation to correct a condition that constitutes a hazardous or immediately hazardous violation of subdivision a of section 27-2017.3 the department shall conduct a final inspection to verify that the violation has been corrected. Where the department determines that the violation has not been corrected, the department may take such enforcement action as is necessary, including performing or arranging for the performance of the work to correct the violation.\n       (4) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a person making a false certification of correction of a violation issued pursuant to article four of subchapter two of this chapter, in addition to any other civil penalty, shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than two thousand dollars nor more than ten thousand dollars for each false certification made, recoverable by the department in a civil action brought in a court of competent jurisdiction. If the person making such false certification is an employee of the owner then such owner shall be responsible for such civil penalty. In addition, any such person making a false certification of correction shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to one thousand dollars or imprisonment for up to one year or both.\n      (5) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, and in addition to any penalties applicable under article three of subchapter five of this chapter,  a person who violates article four of subchapter two of this chapter by failing to correct such violation in accordance with the work practices in section 27-2017.8 and in the rules established pursuant to section 27-2017.9 shall be subject to a civil penalty of five hundred dollars per day for each violation to a maximum of ten thousand dollars from the initial date set for correction in the notice of violation until the date the violation is corrected and certified to the department. There shall be a presumption that the condition constituting a violation continues after the service of the notice of violation. The owner shall be responsible for the correction of all violations noticed pursuant to article four of subchapter two of this chapter, but in an action for civil penalties pursuant to this subdivision may in defense or mitigation of such owner's liability for civil penalties show:\n      (i) That the condition which constitutes the violation did not exist at the time the violation was placed; or\n      (ii) That he or she began to correct the condition which constitutes the violation promptly upon discovering it but that full correction could not be completed expeditiously because of serious technical difficulties, inability to obtain necessary materials, funds or labor;\n      (iii) That he or she was unable to gain access to the dwelling unit wherein the violation exists, or such other portion of the building as might be necessary to make the repair, provided that a postponement was granted pursuant to this subdivision; or\n      (iv) That he or she was unable to obtain a permit or license necessary to correct the violation, provided that diligent and prompt application was made therefore; or\n      (v) That the violation giving rise to the action was caused by the act of negligence, neglect or abuse of another not in the employ or subject to the direction of the owner, except that the owner shall be precluded from showing in defense or mitigation of such owner's liability for civil penalties evidence of any acts occurring, undertaken, or performed by any predecessor in title prior to the owner taking control of the premises. Where the aforesaid allegations are made by way of mitigation of penalties, the owner shall show, by competent proof, pertinent financial data and efforts made to obtain necessary materials, funds or labor or to gain access, or to obtain a permit or license and such other evidence as the court may require. If the court finds that sufficient mitigating circumstances exist, it may remit all or part of any penalties arising from the violations, but may condition such remission upon a correction of the violation within a time period fixed by the court.\n      (6) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, failure by the department to comply with any time period provided in this section relating to responsibilities of the department shall not render null and void any notice of violation issued by the department or the department of health and mental hygiene pursuant to such article or section, and shall not provide a basis for defense or mitigation of an owner's liability for civil penalties for violation of such article\n      �6. Chapter 1 of title 17 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding new sections 17-199.5, 17-199.6, 17-199.7 and 17-199.8 to read as follows:\n      �17-199.5 Encouragement of physician referrals for indoor allergen hazards. a.

The procedures shall also provide for an investigation to be made when the department is notified that a person who has been medically diagnosed with  moderate persistent or severe persistent asthma is residing in a dwelling with possible indoor allergen hazards not otherwise subject to enforcement by the department of housing preservation and development under section 27-2017.6. Such indoor allergen hazards include, but are not limited to, mold that is not readily observable to the eye, including mold that is hidden within wall cavities, construction dust or such other conditions as the department shall from time-to-time determine by rule are indoor allergen hazards.b. In the event that the department determines that an indoor allergen hazard exists, the department shall order the owner to correct the condition and the underlying causes of such a condition within twenty-one days, in a manner and under such safety conditions as it may specify, including the integrated pest management practices in section 27-2017.8 and the work practices established pursuant to section 27-2017.9.\n      c. In the event that the department determines that the owner or other person having the duty or liability to comply with an order issued pursuant to this section fails to substantially comply therewith within twenty-one days after service thereof, the department shall, in accordance with section 27-2017.10, refer such order to the department of housing preservation and development.

The department shall report to the council and mayor no later than 24 months from the effective date on activities it has undertaken under this section as they relate to adults with asthma diagnoses, including but not limited to the number adult asthma referrals by type to the department for inspection, the number and types of orders issued to property owners by the department as a result of adult asthma referrals, and the number of apartments that have completed remediation for indoor asthma allergens as a result of adult asthma referrals. Upon submission of such report the agency may submit a recommendation to the council containing a proposed redefinition of \"persons with medically diagnosed moderate persistent or severe persistent asthma\" for the purposes of the provision of this article.  \n      �17-199.7 Education about indoor allergen hazards. The department shall develop a pamphlet which shall be in English and in the covered languages set forth in section 8-1002, explaining the hazards associated with indoor allergens and describing tenant rights and owner responsibilities under this law, including safe work practices and mechanisms through which the public may report indoor allergen hazards in the home. Such pamphlet shall be made available in accordance with section 27-2017.6. Such pamphlet shall also be made available to any member of the public upon request.  The department shall also develop a training curriculum for educating owners and building maintenance personnel on the appropriate work methods for controlling and removing indoor allergen hazards in rental housing, including integrated pest management. Such training curriculum shall also be made available to any member of the public upon request.\n      �17-199.8 Inspection by the department of unsafe work practices for indoor allergen remediation. The department shall respond to complaints of unsafe work practices related to the correction of indoor mold hazard violations that result in chemical vapors, dust, or other environmental hazards, and promptly refer complaints of unsafe pest control to the New York state department of environmental conservation.\n      �7. This local law shall take effect one year after its enactment, except that the commissioners of health and mental hygiene and housing preservation and development may take such measures as are necessary for its implementation, including the promulgation of rules, before such effective date.\n\n\n2\n\n\n",
