  "Summary": "This bill would amend the City’s Human Rights Law to make it an unlawful discriminatory practice for an employer to use an individual’s consumer credit history in making employment decisions. Due to the sensitive nature of various employment positions that require additional layers of security, the bill would provide exceptions for a limited number of positions.",
