It would also study and report on the feasibility of agencies transmitting the information contained on voter registration forms to the Board of Elections for the purposes of registering a voter or updating a voter registration. The taskforce would consist of the Director of the Mayor’s Office of Operations, the Corporation Counsel, a Mayoral designee who is an expert in election law, an appointee of the Board of Elections, and an appointee of the Speaker. It would be required to issue its findings and recommendations to the Mayor and Speaker in a report no later than one year after the enactment of the local law.","TextID":55021,"Text":"Int.
