(1)  The commissioner shall establish neighborhood slow zones in which speed limits of twenty miles per hour apply on or along designated highways for the purpose of implementing traffic calming measures.  The commissioner shall establish not less than seven neighborhood slow zones, which shall contain not less than five blocks per zone, annually in the years 2014 and 2015.
