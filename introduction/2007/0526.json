Subdivision b of section 11-243 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 16 for the year 2003, is amended to read as follows:\nb.  Subject to the limitations provided in subdivision d of this section and the restrictions in this section on conversion of buildings used in whole or in part for single room occupancy, any increase in the assessed valuation of real property shall be exempt from taxation for local purposes to the extent such increase results from the reasonable cost of: (1) the conversion of a class B multiple dwelling to a class A multiple dwelling except insofar as the gross cubic content of such building is increased thereby; or (2) the conversion of any nonresidential building or structure situated in the county of New York to a class A multiple dwelling except insofar as the gross cubic content of such building is increased; or (3) the conversion of any nonresidential building or structure situated in the counties of Bronx, Kings, Queens or Richmond to a class A multiple dwelling except insofar as the gross cubic content of such building or structure is increased thereby; or (4) alterations or improvements to the exterior of an otherwise eligible building or structure visible from a public street pursuant to a permit issued by the landmarks commission with respect to a designated historic or landmark site or structure; or (5) alterations or improvements constituting a moderate rehabilitation of a substantially occupied class A multiple dwelling except insofar as the gross cubic content of such building or structure is increased thereby; or (6) alterations or improvements to an otherwise eligible building or structure commenced after January first, nineteen hundred eighty designed to conserve the use of fuel, electricity or other energy sources or to reduce demand for electricity, including the installation of meters for purposes of measuring the amount of electricity consumed for each dwelling unit, and conversions of direct metering to a system that includes a master meter and submeters in any cooperative, condominium, or housing development fund company organized under article eleven of the private housing finance law; or (7) alterations or improvements to existing dwellings to eliminate existing unhealthy or dangerous conditions in any such existing dwelling or replace inadequate and obsolete sanitary facilities in any such existing dwelling, any of which represents fire or health hazards, including as improvements asbestos abatement to the extent such asbestos abatement is required by federal, state or local law, except insofar as the gross cubic content of such existing dwelling is increased thereby; or (8) conversion of residential units qualified for the protection of article seven-C of the multiple dwelling law in buildings or portions thereof registered with the New York city loft board as interim multiple dwellings pursuant to such article to units which are in compliance with the standards of safety and fire protection set forth in article seven-B of the multiple dwelling law or to units which have a certificate of occupancy as class A multiple dwellings; or (9) alterations or improvements commenced on or after September first, nineteen hundred eighty-seven constituting a substantial rehabilitation of a class A multiple dwelling, or a conversion of a building or structure into a class A multiple dwelling, as part of a program to provide housing for low and moderate income households as defined by the department of housing preservation and development pursuant to the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to subdivision m of this section, provided that such alterations or improvements or conversions shall be aided by a grant, loan or subsidy from any federal, state or local agency or instrumentality, including, in the discretion of the department of housing preservation and development, a subsidy in the form of a below market sale from the city of New York; or (10) alterations or improvements to any private dwelling or conversion of any private dwelling to a multiple dwelling or conversion of any multiple dwelling to a private dwelling, provided that such alterations, improvements or conversions are part of a project that has applied for or is receiving benefits pursuant to this section and shall be aided by a grant, loan or subsidy from any federal, state or local agency or instrumentality.  Such conversions, alterations or improvements shall be completed within thirty-six months after the date on which same shall be started except that such thirty-six month limitation shall not apply to conversions of residential units which are registered with the loft board in accordance with article seven-C of the multiple dwelling law pursuant to paragraph eight of this subdivision.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a sixty-month period for completion shall be available for alterations or improvements undertaken by a housing development fund company organized pursuant to article eleven of the private housing finance law, which are carried out with the substantial assistance of grants, loans or subsidies from any federal, state or local governmental agency or instrumentality or which are carried out in a property transferred from the city of New York if alterations and improvements are completed within seven years after the date of transfer.  In addition, the department of housing preservation and development may grant an extension of the period of completion for any project carried out with the substantial assistance of grants, loans or subsidies from any federal, state or local governmental agency or instrumentality, if such alterations, improvements or conversions are completed within sixty months from commencement of construction.
