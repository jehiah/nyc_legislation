Under Section 957(d)(i) of the General Municipal Law, certain business enterprises located outside the boundaries of an Empire Zone may still be eligible for Empire Zone benefits as a “regionally significant project” because the economic activity of such enterprise is of a nature that is encouraged by the State, and the Administrative Board of such Empire Zone authorizes the designation of such business as a regionally significant project.  The New York State Department of Economic Development and the South Jamaica Zone Administrative Board have determined that the proposed expansion of the Bimmy LLC’s manufacturing facility in Long Island City is projected to create 100 new jobs and is eligible for Empire Zones benefits as a regionally significant project under Section 957(d)(i) of the General Municipal Law.  \n§2. Chapter 7 of title 22 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding new section 22-716 to read as follows:\n§22-716  Authorization for the designation of a regionally significant project. a. Pursuant to the provisions of article 18-B of the general municipal law, a business enterprise may be designated as a regionally significant project if the criteria set forth in paragraph i of subdivision d of section 957 of such article are met.\n b.  By a resolution of the South Jamaica empire zone administrative board, dated December 15, 2006, such administrative board, in accordance with the provisions of article 18-B of the general municipal law, supported the designation of Bimmy’s LLC, having federal employer identification number 13-4126542 and located at 47-00 thirty-third street in the borough of Queens, as a regionally significant project. \nc. Pursuant to the provisions of article 18-B of the general municipal law,  such regionally significant project shall be as set forth as follows: \nBimmy’s LLC, having federal employer identification number 13-4126542 and located at 47-00 thirty-third street, also known as Block: 252  Lot: 18, in the borough of Queens.\n§3.
