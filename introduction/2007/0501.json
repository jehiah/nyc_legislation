Issuance of certificate of domestic partnership registration. The city clerk shall issue a certificate of domestic partnership registration to persons who have registered pursuant to this subchapter.

Bereavement leave and child care leave of absence for city employees; \n\t[b.] 2. Visitation in city correctional and juvenile detention facilities; \n\t[c.] 3.
