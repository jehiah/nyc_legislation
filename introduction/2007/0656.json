A charge in accordance with meter rates or minimum charges for the supply of water  measured by meter, and a service charge shall not be due or become a lien or charge upon the premises where such meter is installed until an entry shall have been made indicating that such premises are metered, with the date of such entry in the book in which the charges for water by meter measurement against such premises are to be entered. The words \"sewer rents\" when used in this chapter shall mean any rents or charges imposed pursuant to section 24-514 of the code or pursuant to the New York city municipal water finance authority act, which is set forth in title two-A of article five of the public authorities law.

The words \"tax lien\" when used in this chapter shall mean the lien arising pursuant to the provisions of this chapter or pursuant to the New York city municipal water finance authority act, which is set forth in title two-A of article five of the public authorities law, as a result of the nonpayment of taxes, assessments, sewer rents, sewer surcharges, water rents, any other charges that are made a lien subject to the provisions of this chapter, the costs of any advertisements and notices given pursuant to this chapter, any other charges that are due and payable, a surcharge pursuant to section 11-332 of this chapter if the tax lien is sold, interest and penalties thereon and the right of the city to receive such amounts. The words \"tax lien certificate\" when used in this chapter shall mean the instrument evidencing a tax lien and executed by the commissioner of finance or his or her designee at such time as such lien is transferred to a purchaser upon sale of such lien by the city.\n§ 2. Subdivisions a and a-1 of section 11-319 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 36 for the year 2001, are amended to read as follows:\na. A tax lien or tax liens on a property or any component of the amount thereof may be sold by the city as authorized by subdivision b of this section, when such tax lien or tax liens shall have remained unpaid in whole or in part for one year, provided, however, that a tax lien or tax liens on any class 1 property or on class 2 property that is a residential condominium or residential cooperative, as such classes of property are defined in subdivision 1 of section 1802 of the real property tax law, may be sold by the city only when the real property tax component of such tax lien or tax liens shall have remained unpaid in whole or in part for three years or, in the case of abandoned class 1 property or abandoned class 2 property that is a residential condominium or residential cooperative, for eighteen months, and after such sale, shall be transferred, in the manner provided by this chapter, and provided, further, however, that (i) the real property tax component of such tax lien may not be sold pursuant to this subdivision on any residential real property in class 1 that is receiving an exemption pursuant to section 11-245.3 or 11-245.4 of this title, or where the owner of such residential real property in class 1 has been allowed a credit pursuant to subsection (e) of section six hundred six of the tax law for the calendar year in which the date of the first publication, pursuant to subdivision a of section 11-320 of this chapter, of the notice of sale, occurs or for the calendar year immediately preceding such date and (ii) the sewer rents component, sewer surcharges component or water rents component of such tax lien may not be sold pursuant to this subdivision on any one family residential real property in class 1 or on any two or three family residential real property in class 1 that is receiving an exemption pursuant to section 11-245.3 or 11-245.4 of this title, or where the owner of any two or three family residential real property in class 1 has been allowed a credit pursuant to subsection (e) of section six hundred six of the tax law for the calendar year in which the date of the first publication, pursuant to subdivision a of section 11-320 of this chapter, of the notice of sale, occurs or for the calendar year immediately preceding such date. A tax lien or tax liens on any property classified as a class 2 property, except a class 2 property that is a residential condominium or residential cooperative, or class 3 property, as such classes of property are defined in subdivision 1 of section 1802 of the real property tax law, shall not be sold by the city unless such tax lien or tax liens include a real property tax component as of the date of the first publication, pursuant to subdivision a of section 11-320 of this chapter, of the notice of sale. Notwithstanding any provision of this subdivision to the contrary, any such tax lien or tax liens that remain unpaid in whole or in part after such date may be sold regardless of whether such tax lien or tax liens include a real property tax component. A tax lien or tax liens on a property classified as a class 4 property, as such class of property is defined in subdivision 1 of section 1802 of the real property tax law, shall not be sold by the city unless such tax lien or tax liens include a real property tax component or sewer rents component or sewer surcharges component or water rents component as of the date of the first publication, pursuant to subdivision a of section 11-320 of this chapter, of the notice of sale, provided, however, that any tax lien or tax liens that remain unpaid in whole or in part after such date may be sold regardless of whether such tax lien or tax liens include a real property tax component, sewer rents component, sewer surcharges component or water rents component. For purposes of this subdivision, the words \"real property tax\" shall not include an assessment or charge upon property imposed pursuant to section 25-411 of the administrative code. A sale of a tax lien or tax liens shall include, in addition to such lien or liens that have remained unpaid in whole or in part for one year, or, in the case of any class 1 property or class 2 property that is a residential condominium or residential cooperative, when the real property tax component of such lien or liens has remained unpaid in whole or in part for three years, any taxes, assessments, sewer rents, sewer surcharges, water rents, any other charges that are made a lien subject to the provisions of this chapter, the costs of any advertisements and notices given pursuant to this chapter, any other charges that are due and payable, a surcharge pursuant to section 11-332 of this chapter, and interest and penalties thereon or such component of the amount thereof as shall be determined by the commissioner of finance.
