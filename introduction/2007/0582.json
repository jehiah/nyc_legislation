  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\nSection 1. Subdivisions 7, 8 and 9 of section 16-118 of the administrative code of the city of New York, subdivision 9 as amended by local law number 1 for the year 2003, are amended to read as follows:\n7. [(a) No person shall prevent or interfere with any employee of the department of sanitation in the sweeping or cleaning of any street or in the removal of sweepings, ashes, garbage, rubbish, snow, ice, or other refuse material.\n       \t(b) No person, other than an authorized employee or agent of the department shall disturb or remove any ashes, garbage or light refuse or rubbish placed by householders, or their tenants, or by occupants or their servants, within the stoop or area line, or in front of houses or lots, for removal, unless requested by residents of such houses.]\n(a) No person shall prevent or interfere with any employee of the department in the sweeping or cleaning of any street, in the removal of snow or ice, or in the collection or removal of any amount of solid waste or recyclable materials.  \n(b)(1) Except for an authorized employee or agent of the department, it shall be unlawful for any person to disturb, remove or transport by motor vehicle any amount of recyclable materials that have been placed by owners, tenants or occupants of residential premises, premises occupied by city agencies or institutions, or vacant lots, or by their servants, within the stoop area, adjacent to the curb line or otherwise within or adjacent to such premises or lots for collection or removal by the department unless requested by the owner of such residential premises or vacant lot or his or her agent, and such request is evidenced by a notarized written agreement that:  (i) has been signed by such person and such owner or agent; (ii) has been filed with the commissioner and bears a file stamp indicating that it has been so filed; and (iii) includes the names of the parties to the agreement, the names and titles of all signatories to the agreement, the taxpayer identification number, including individual taxpayer identification number or employer identification number but not social security number of each such party, the agreed price terms, if any, the estimated quantity of recyclable materials to be removed, the agreed removal days and times, if any, the duration of the agreement, and any other information required by the commissioner by rule. The requirement to enter into and file such written agreement pursuant to this subdivision shall not apply to one, two or three-family residential premises. \n(2) In addition, on or before February first and August first of every year, every person engaged in the removal of recyclable materials from residential premises or vacant lots pursuant to a written agreement shall submit to the commissioner a report identifying the weight of each type of recyclable material removed by such person during the periods of July first to December thirty-first and January first to June thirtieth, respectively.  It shall be unlawful for any person to fail to submit a report in accordance with this subparagraph or to submit a report containing false or deceptive information.\n(3) Except for an authorized employee or agent of the department, it shall be unlawful for any person to disturb, remove or transport by motor vehicle any amount of solid waste that has been placed by owners, tenants or occupants of residential premises, premises occupied by city agencies or institutions, or vacant lots, or by their servants, within the stoop area, adjacent to the curb line or otherwise within or adjacent to such premises or lots for collection or removal by the department.\n(c) Except for an authorized employee of an entity licensed by or registered with the business integrity commission, it shall be unlawful for any person to disturb, remove or transport by motor vehicle any amount of recyclable materials that have been placed by owners, tenants or occupants of commercial premises within the stoop area, adjacent to the curb line or otherwise within or adjacent to such premises for collection or removal by an entity licensed by or registered with the business integrity commission.  It shall be presumed that a person operating a motor vehicle without plates issued by the business integrity commission is not an authorized employee of an entity licensed by or registered with the business integrity commission.\n(d) No person, other than a not-for-profit corporation, shall receive recyclable materials for storage, collection or processing from any person other than an authorized employee or agent of the department, an authorized employee of an entity licensed by or registered with the business integrity commission, a not-for-profit corporation or a person who has entered into a written agreement pursuant to subparagraph one of paragraph b of this subdivision.  It shall be an affirmative defense that all such recyclable materials were generated or collected outside the city of New York.  This paragraph shall not apply to a redemption center, dealer or distributor as defined in section 27-1003 of the environmental conservation law.  \n(e) Any person who violates subparagraph one of paragraph b of this subdivision while using or operating a motor vehicle or paragraph d of this subdivision shall be punished for each violation by a criminal fine of not less than one thousand dollars nor more than two thousand dollars for each such violation or by imprisonment not to exceed ninety days, or both.  \n(f)(1)(i) Any person who violates subparagraph one of paragraph b or paragraph c of this subdivision while using or operating a motor vehicle shall be liable for a civil penalty of two thousand dollars for the first offense and five thousand dollars for each subsequent offense within a twelve-month period.  In addition, every owner of such motor vehicle shall be liable for a civil penalty of two thousand dollars for the first offense and five thousand dollars if, within a twelve-month period, a motor vehicle owned by such person was used in violation of subparagraph one of paragraph b or paragraph c of this subdivision.  The owner of a motor vehicle used in violation of subparagraph one of paragraph b or paragraph c of this subdivision shall not be liable for any civil penalty if such owner establishes that the motor vehicle was used without such owner’s permission.
