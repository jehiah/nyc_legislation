Subparagraph b of paragraph two of subdivision e)of section 27-901 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by chapter 65 of the laws of 1996, is amended to read as follows:\nb.  A public water supply system, and a sanitary or combined sewer for the purpose of conveying sewage, shall be deemed available to a one- and two-family dwelling if a property line of such dwelling is within one hundred feet (measured along a street, alley, or right-of-way) of the public water supply system or the sewer. The connection shall be made in accordance with the applicable standards of the department of environmental protection, provided, however, that such one- and two-family dwelling need not connect directly to the sewer if the common elements of an internal private drain are located in a dedicated, unobstructed right-of-way that extends to the sewer with a minimum width of ten feet located entirely outside of the building footprint and outside of all overhangs and projections that are less than fourteen feet in height above grade. \n\t§2.  Section PC 701.2.3 of the New York city plumbing code, as added by local law number 8 for the year 2008, is amended to read as follows:\n\t701.2.3  Availability of public sewer to one- or two-family dwellings. A public sanitary or combined sewer shall be deemed available to a one- and two-family dwelling if a property line of such dwelling is within 100 feet (30 480 mm), measured along a street, alley, or right-of-way, of the public sewer. The extension and connection shall be made in accordance with the applicable standards of the Department of Environmental Protection, provided, however, that such one- and two-family dwelling need not connect directly to the public sanitary or combined sewer if the common elements of an internal private drain are located in a dedicated, unobstructed right-of-way that extends to the sanitary or combined sewer with a minimum width of ten feet located entirely outside of the building footprint and outside of all overhangs and projections that are less than fourteen feet in height above grade.\nException: Where two or more one- or two-family dwellings are to be constructed on a tract of land, the public sanitary or combined sewer may be declared available thereto by the agencies having jurisdiction thereon even though the specified distance is exceeded.\n\t§3.  Section PC 701.3 of the New York city plumbing code, as added by local law number 99 for the year 2005, is amended to read as follows:\n\t701.3  Separate sewer connection. Every building having plumbing fixtures installed and intended for human habitation, occupancy or use on premises abutting on a street, alley or easement in which there is a public sewer shall have a separate connection with the sewer. Where located on the same lot, multiple buildings shall not be prohibited from connecting to a common building sewer that connects to the public sewer, provided, however, that the common elements of an internal private drain are located in a dedicated, unobstructed right-of-way that extends to the sewer with a minimum width of ten feet located entirely outside of the building footprint and outside of all overhangs and projections that are less than fourteen feet in height above grade. \n\t  §4. Section one of this local law shall take effect upon enactment and sections two and three of this local law shall take effect on July 1, 2008, except that the commissioner of buildings shall take such actions as are necessary for the implementation of sections two and three of this local law, including the promulgation of rules, prior to such effective date.\n\n\n4/22/08  - Clean",
