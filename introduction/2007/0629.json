The New York city charter is amended by adding a new section 224.2 to read as follows: \n\t§224.2 Sustainable stormwater management standards for capital projects. Each capital project shall be designed and constructed according to standards that minimize the post-construction discharge of stormwater and stormwater-related pollution into sewers and waterbodies through the retention, detention, infiltration, reuse, and treatment of stormwater. Such standards shall be determined by the department of environmental protection and reflect best management practices for sustainable stormwater management established pursuant to section 24-526.1 of chapter 5 of title 24 of the administrative code of the city of New York. For purposes of this section, “capital project” shall mean a capital project as defined in section 210 of the New York city charter that is paid for in whole or in part from the city treasury and has an estimated construction cost of at least two million dollars. \n\t§2. This local law shall take effect immediately and shall apply to all capital projects that first receive capital dollars from the city treasury on or after July 1, 2008; provided this local law shall apply to any capital project that receives capital dollars from the city treasury before July 1, 2008 where the department determines that such application is feasible. \n\t\nLP\nLS#4029\n10/11/07",
