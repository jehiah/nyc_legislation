  "Summary": "",
  "TextID": 41009,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\nSection 1. Legislative findings. The Council finds that many New Yorkers suffer from health conditions related to poor nutrition, such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer and high blood pressure.  Obesity rates in NYC have increased more than 70% since 1994. More than 1.1 million New Yorkers are obese, and another 2 million are overweight. Similarly, diabetes has more than doubled in NYC over the past 10 years.  More than 500,000 adult New Yorkers have diagnosed diabetes and an additional 200,000 have diabetes and do not yet know it.\nPoor nutrition, obesity, and diabetes are interconnected. According to one national study, eating fruits and vegetables three or more times a day as opposed to less than once a day is associated with a 42% lower risk of dying from stroke and 24% lower risk of dying from heart disease.  Neighborhoods where fruit and vegetable consumption is the lowest have high rates of obesity and diabetes.  In neighborhoods with the lowest fruit and vegetable consumption, such as East New York, Bushwick and Bedford-Stuyvesant, as many as one in four adults report that they did not eat a single fruit or vegetable the previous day. The availability of healthy food in the immediate neighborhood has a strong impact on the diet of its residents. In East Harlem, only 4% of small grocery stores sell leafy green vegetables and only 25% sell apples, oranges and bananas. With small grocery stores outnumbering supermarkets by almost three to one in such neighborhoods, residents of low-income neighborhoods have few healthy food options close to home. These findings demonstrate an urgent need to take measures that increase the accessibility of fruits and vegetables in neighborhoods where studies show that consumption of these items is low.\n§2. Section 17-306 of the administrative code of the City of New York is amended by amending subdivision f, as added by local law 97 for the year 1985, and by adding new subdivisions q, r and s to read as follows:\nf. \"Pushcart\". Any wheeled vehicle or device used by a food vendor, other than a motor vehicle or trailer, which may be moved with or without the assistance of a motor and which does not  require registration by the department of motor vehicles. The term “pushcart” shall include any green cart, as that term is defined by subdivision s of this section.\nq. “Fresh fruits and vegetables”. Unprocessed unfrozen raw fruits and vegetables that have not been combined with other ingredients.\n  r. “Fresh fruits and vegetables permit”. A full-term permit for the vending at retail solely of fresh fruits or vegetables, or both, from a pushcart or vehicle in a public place.  Unless otherwise specified, a fresh fruits and vegetables permit shall be a permit in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter.\ns. “Green cart”.

Legislative findings. The Council finds that many New Yorkers suffer from health conditions related to poor nutrition, such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer and high blood pressure.  Obesity rates in NYC have increased more than 70% since 1994. More than 1.1 million New Yorkers are obese, and another 2 million are overweight. Similarly, diabetes has more than doubled in NYC over the past 10 years.  More than 500,000 adult New Yorkers have diagnosed diabetes and an additional 200,000 have diabetes and do not yet know it.\\par\nPoor nutrition, obesity, and diabetes are interconnected. According to one national study, eating fruits and vegetables three or more times a day as opposed to less than once a day is associated with a 42% lower risk of dying from stroke and 24% lower risk of dying from heart disease.  Neighborhoods where fruit and vegetable consumption is the lowest have high rates of obesity and diabetes.  In neighborhoods with the lowest fruit and vegetable consumption, such as East New York, Bushwick and Bedford-Stuyvesant, as many as one in four adults report that they did not eat a single fruit or vegetable the previous day. The availability of healthy food in the immediate neighborhood has a strong impact on the diet of its residents. In East Harlem, only 4% of small grocery stores sell leafy green vegetables and only 25% sell apples, oranges and bananas. With small grocery stores outnumbering supermarkets by almost three to one in such neighborhoods, residents of low-income neighborhoods have few healthy food options close to home. These findings demonstrate an urgent need to take measures that increase the accessibility of fruits and vegetables in neighborhoods where studies show that consumption of these items is low.\\par\n\\'a72.
