The City Council finds that knowing a patients approximate height and weight will assist emergency service personnel in determining whether or not additional equipment or personnel are required to efficiently and effectively transport a patient to the hospital.\n\t§2. Chapter 1 of title 14 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 14.152, to read as follows:\n§14-521  911 emergency call patient information. a. When a 911 operator receives an emergency call that requires fire or emergency service personnel to be dispatched to aid a patient, the 911 operator shall ask the caller for the approximate height and weight of the patient, when practicable, and give that information to the fire or emergency service dispatcher. In the event the 911 operator transfers the emergency call to fire or emergency service dispatchers prior to obtaining the height and weight information of the patient, the fire or emergency service dispatcher shall ask the caller for the approximate height and weight of the patient, when practicable.\n\n§3.
