  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\nSection 1. Subchapter 7 of chapter 1 of title 24 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 24-163.9 to read as follows:\n§24-163.9  Retrofitting of and age limitations on diesel fuel-powered school buses.\na.  Definitions.  For the purposes of this section only, the following terms shall have the following meanings:\n(1)  “Department of education” means the New York city department of education, formerly known as the New York city board of education, and any successor agency or entity thereto, the expenses of which are paid in whole or in part from the city treasury.\n(2)  “Person” means any natural person, partnership, firm, company, association, joint stock association, corporation or other legal entity.\n(3)  “School bus” means any vehicle of the designation “Type A bus,” “Type B bus,” “Type C bus,” or “Type D bus,” as set forth in subdivisions x, y, z, and aa of section 720.1 of title seventeen of New York codes, rules and regulations, that is operated pursuant to a school bus contract and is used to transport children to or from any school located in the city of New York. \n(4)  “School bus contract” means any agreement between any person and the department of education to transport children on a school bus.\nb.  Diesel fuel-powered school buses shall utilize a closed crankcase ventilation system, selected from among the mobile sources devices identified and approved as part of the diesel retrofit verified technologies list by the United States environmental protection agency or the list of currently verified diesel emission control strategies by the California air resources board, to reduce engine emissions to the school bus cabin, in accordance with the following schedule:\n(1) fifty percent of diesel fuel-powered school buses used to fulfill each school bus contract shall be equipped with such a closed crankcase ventilation system by September 1, 2010;\n(2) one hundred percent of diesel fuel-powered school buses used to fulfill each school bus contract shall be equipped with such a closed crankcase ventilation system by September 1, 2011;\nc.  Diesel fuel-powered school buses shall not be used to fulfill any school bus contract beyond the end of the sixteenth year from the date of manufacture, as noted on the vehicle registration, or the end of the school year in which that date falls, whichever is later.\nd.  School buses shall be replaced pursuant to subdivision c of this section with (1) a school bus meeting the most recent diesel engine emissions standards issued by the United States environmental protection agency, or (2) an all-electric, gasoline-powered, compressed natural gas, or hybrid school bus, as long as the particulate matter emissions of such school bus do not exceed emission levels permitted in the most recent diesel engine emissions standards issued by the United States environmental protection agency. \ne.  No later than December 31, 2011, and no later than December 31 of every year thereafter, the department of education shall submit a report to the mayor and the speaker of the council on compliance with this section.
