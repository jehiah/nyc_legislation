The types of explosives to be used, quantities, charge weight per initiation, blast sequence and pattern, and number, depth and diameter of drill holes.\nc. Notifications and permit survey meeting.  Prior to the issuance of any permit for the use of explosives for blasting operations, a permit survey meeting shall be arranged by the owner or the owner’s blasting contractor and conducted at the job site at which blasting operations are to occur, for the purpose of reviewing the measures that the blasting contractor will be required to undertake to safeguard affected buildings, structures and infrastructure.  Such permit survey meeting shall be attended by representatives of the department, general contractor and blasting contractor.  The owner or the owner’s blasting contractor shall in addition notify the department of buildings of the meeting, and invite the participation of owners of affected buildings, structures and infrastructure as determined by the department to be appropriate.

Excavation Blasting.  The commissioner may require the owner or the owner’s blasting contractor to retain a professional engineer to conduct a post-blasting survey at any time during or upon the completion of blasting operations upon a determination that such a survey is necessary or appropriate as a result of ground vibration levels exceeding the reporting level set by the department, or other good cause.\nn. Recordkeeping.  A copy of the pre-blasting survey, the blasting plan for demolition blasting, the blasting patterns utilized for excavation blasting operations, and the vibration and airblast measurements, required by this section, shall be maintained at the job site until the completion of blasting operations, and, together with any post-blasting survey required by this section, shall thereafter be kept by the owner or the owner’s blasting contractor for a period of three years from the completion of blasting operations at the job site.
