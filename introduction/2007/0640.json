This chapter shall be known as and may be cited as the “New York City Plastic Carryout Bag and Film Plastic Recycling Law”.\n§ 16-451 Declaration of policy.  It is hereby declared to be the public policy of the city of New York to reduce environmental pollution, to reduce the toxicity of waste materials in the solid waste stream directed to resource recovery and sanitary landfill facilities, and to maximize the removal of plastic carryout bags and film plastic from the waste stream in order to recycle them.  Plastic carryout bags and film plastic do not biodegrade, which means that such bags and film plastic ultimately break down into smaller pieces that enter the ecosystem.  These pieces of plastic cause illness, injury and death to animal and marine life by entangling them or contaminating their food supplies.  The production of plastic bags and film plastic worldwide uses over 12 million barrels of oil per year, which causes significant environmental impacts. \n§ 16-452 Definitions.
