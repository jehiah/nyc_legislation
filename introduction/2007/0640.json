  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows: \n\t\nSection 1.  Title 16 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new chapter 4-B to read as follows:\nCHAPTER 4-B\n      § 16-450 Title.\n\t                                      § 16-451 Declaration of policy.\n\t                      § 16-452 Definitions.\n\t     § 16-453 Recycling program requirements.\n                       § 16-454 Manufacturer responsibilities.\n         \t                  § 16-455 Penalties.\n\n§ 16-450 Title.  This chapter shall be known as and may be cited as the “New York City Plastic Carryout Bag and Film Plastic Recycling Law”.\n§ 16-451 Declaration of policy.  It is hereby declared to be the public policy of the city of New York to reduce environmental pollution, to reduce the toxicity of waste materials in the solid waste stream directed to resource recovery and sanitary landfill facilities, and to maximize the removal of plastic carryout bags and film plastic from the waste stream in order to recycle them.  Plastic carryout bags and film plastic do not biodegrade, which means that such bags and film plastic ultimately break down into smaller pieces that enter the ecosystem.  These pieces of plastic cause illness, injury and death to animal and marine life by entangling them or contaminating their food supplies.  The production of plastic bags and film plastic worldwide uses over 12 million barrels of oil per year, which causes significant environmental impacts. \n§ 16-452 Definitions.  When used in this chapter: a.  “Chain of stores” means five or more stores located within the city of New York that are engaged in the same general field of business and (1) conduct business under the same business name or (2) operate under common ownership or management or pursuant to a franchise agreement with the same franchisor.\nb.  “Consumer” means any person who purchases a product from a store that is \nplaced in a plastic carryout bag at the time of sale.\nc.  “Film plastic” means uncontaminated non-rigid film plastic packaging products composed of plastic resins that include, but are not limited to, newspaper bags, dry cleaning bags and shrink-wrap.\nd.  “Food service establishment” means any establishment (1) where the primary business is providing food for individual portion service directly to the consumer, whether consumption of such food occurs on or off the premises or such service is provided in a premises or from a pushcart, stand or vehicle, and (2) that is subject to the permit requirement contained in section 81.05 of the New York city health code. \ne. \"Manufacturer\" means every person, firm or corporation that: (1) produces plastic carryout bags that are sold or distributed within the city of New York, or (2) imports plastic carryout bags into the United States that are sold or distributed within the city of New York.\nf.  \"Operator\" means a person, firm or corporation that owns or is in control of, or \nhas responsibility for, the daily operation of a store.\ng.  \"Plastic carryout bag\" means a plastic bag provided by a store to a consumer at the point of sale that is not a reusable bag.\nh.  \"Reusable bag\" means (1) a bag made of cloth or other machine washable fabric that has handles, or  (2) a durable plastic bag, with handles, that is at least 2.25 mils thick and is specifically designed and manufactured for multiple reuse.\ni.  \"Store\" means a retail or wholesale establishment, other than a food service establishment, that sells products and provides plastic carryout bags to consumers in which to place these products and (1) has over five thousand square feet of retail or wholesale space or (2) is one of a chain of stores. \n§ 16-453 Recycling program requirements. a.

It is hereby declared to be the public policy of the city of New York to reduce environmental pollution, to reduce the toxicity of waste materials in the solid waste stream directed to resource recovery and sanitary landfill facilities, and to maximize the removal of plastic carryout bags and film plastic from the waste stream in order to recycle them.  Plastic carryout bags and film plastic do not biodegrade, which means that such bags and film plastic ultimately break down into smaller pieces that enter the ecosystem.  These pieces of plastic cause illness, injury and death to animal and marine life by entangling them or contaminating their food supplies.  The production of plastic bags and film plastic worldwide uses over 12 million barrels of oil per year, which causes significant environmental impacts.\\cf1  \\cf0\\ulnone\\par\n\\ul\\'a7 16-452 Definitions.
