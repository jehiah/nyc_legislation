Chapter 5 of title 25 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 25-473 to read as follows:\n\t§25- 473   Sunnyside business improvement district.\n            \t a.   The city council having determined, pursuant to section 25-407 of chapter four of this title:  that notice of hearing for all hearings required to be held was published and mailed as required by law and was otherwise sufficient; that, except as otherwise provided in section 25-403 of chapter four of this title, all the real property within the boundaries of the district will benefit from the establishment of the district; that all the real property benefited is included within the limits of the district; and that the establishment of the district is in the public interest; and the council having determined further that the requisite number of owners have not objected as provided in section 25-406 of chapter four of this title, there is hereby established in the borough of Queens, the Sunnyside business improvement district.  Such district is established in accordance with the district plan required to be filed with the city clerk pursuant to subdivision b of this section.\n\tb.
