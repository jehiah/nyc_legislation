Title 19 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding thereto a new chapter 7 to read as follows:\nChapter 7  Contracts\n    \t�19-701 Definitions.  a.  \"Cost incentive contract\" shall be defined as a contract that provides for the reimbursement to the contractor of allowable costs incurred in the performance of the contract up to a dollar amount which the contractor shall not exceed, except at its own expense, without prior approval or subsequent ratification and establishes a formula whereby the contractor is rewarded for performing at less than target cost or is penalized if it exceeds target cost.  Target cost is the estimated cost for the performance of the contract that is established at the outset.\n\n    \tb.  \"Performance incentive contract\" shall be defined as a contract in which the parties establish at the outset a pricing basis for the contract, performance goals, and a formula which varies the profit or the fee if specified performance goals are exceeded or not met.  The contractor receives a greater profit or fee if the specified performance goals are exceeded and is receives a reduced profit or fee if the specified performance goals are not met. \n    \t�19-702  Contracts for construction, maintenance and repair of public roads, streets, highways, parkways, bridges and tunnels. Every contract entered into by the department for the construction, maintenance and repair of public roads, streets, highways, parkways, bridges and tunnels shall be either a cost incentive contract or performance incentive contract, except that the commissioner may enter into a contract other than a cost incentive contract or performance incentive contract when a written determination is made with specific reasons set forth as to why it is either not practicable or not advantageous to the city to do so.   A copy of such determination shall be maintained in the relevant contract file and quarterly reports shall be issued to the mayor and the council.\n    \t�2.  This local law shall take effect immediately upon its enactment.\n    \n    \tReferred to the Committee on Transportation.\nLS#2394\nTransportation\n2/23/94\nJJ:ts\nInt. 202",
