  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection 1.  Declaration of legislative findings and intent.   The Council of the City of New York finds that manufacturers of alcoholic beverages engage in marketing and advertising strategies designed to promote the use of those products by young people to whom it is illegal to sell or distribute these products. Such strategies undermine laws prohibiting the sale or distribution of alcoholic beverages to persons below legal age. Therefore, the Council intends to strengthen compliance with and enforcement of laws prohibiting the sale or distribution of alcoholic beverages to those below the legal drinking age and to protect our young people from such illegal sales.\n\tThe Council further finds that the exposure of minors to such alcohol product advertising and promotion may be constitutionally restricted through reasonable targeted limitations on the advertising of such products near schools and other locations where young people tend to congregate, and through a prohibition on the offering of promotions to those persons.  \n\tAccording to the New York City Five-Year Plan for Alcoholism Services 1994-1999 (1995 Annual Update pages 4-5) published by the New York City Department of Mental Health, Mental Retardation and Alcoholism Services,  \"Alcohol is the most widely used drug in America.  One out of three American adults -56 million Americans -say alcohol abuse has brought trouble to his or her family.  That is four times the number of families that say that other drugs have troubled their homes.  Children of alcoholics have a four times greater risk of becoming alcoholics than children of non-alcoholics.\"  The annual \"Monitoring The Future Study\" of alcohol and drug use by American students has shown consistently that  \"alcohol is the drug most often used and abused by children and adolescents.\"  See:  American Academy of Pediatrics  Alcohol Use and  Abuse: A Pediatric Concern,  Pediatrics, Vol. 06, No. 3, March 1995, p. 439.\n\tIt was also reported in the above noted study that in 1992, 88% of American high school seniors had tried alcohol at least once, compared with 82% of tenth graders and 69% of eighth graders.  In that study it was shown that 56% of students in grades five through twelve said that alcohol advertising encouraged them to drink. Over 80% of the adults surveyed by the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in 1988 indicated that they believed that alcohol advertising influences underage youth to drink alcoholic beverages.1\nAlcohol is widely advertised and such advertisements are frequently seen by teenagers on television. Drinking alcohol is portrayed by advertisers as being sophisticated and a natural part of life.2  Even though alcohol use by 12-17-year olds is illegal in every state, in a 1996 study, 39% admitted to use at least once in their lifetime, 33% to past-year use and 19% to past-month use.3\n\tIndeed, alcoholic beverages are the second most heavily advertised products in America, and the alcoholic beverage industry spends more than $100 million annually for outdoor advertising of its products.4  Outdoor advertisements are a distinguishable and effective medium of advertising one's product that has the undeniable effect of subjecting the general public to involuntary and unavoidable forms of solicitation.  \nIn one of the most comprehensive studies of alcohol advertising and youth, a team of Colorado State University researchers has found strong ethnic and gender differences in the way adolescents respond to televised beer advertising. The study funded by a $400,000 grant from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism indicated that both male and female adolescents who responded positively to beer ads were more likely to use alcohol or say they planned to drink alcohol as adults.  Adolescents who responded negatively to the ads or were more likely to criticize messages contained in those ads were less likely to use alcohol or have plans to drink alcohol when they reached legal drinking age.5  \n\tFifty-six percent of students in grades five through twelve say that alcohol advertising encourages them to drink.  The United States Surgeon General reports that life expectancy has improved in the United States over the past 75 years for every age group except one: The death rate for 15- to 24- year olds is higher today than it was 20 years ago.  Approximately 2/3 of teenagers who drink report that they can buy their own alcohol and it is estimated that 6.9 million American junior and senior high students can walk into a store and buy their own alcohol. \n\tResearch consistently showed that children's attitudes favorable to alcohol are significantly related to their exposure to alcohol advertisements.  Children are exposed to billboards advertising alcohol on a regular basis simply by walking to school or playing in their neighborhood, and there is no practical means of monitoring or limiting exposure to these public advertisements.6 \n\tThe New York State Alcoholic Beverage Control Law (ABCL) mandates that any person with a license to sell alcoholic beverages must display a sign stating that the sale of alcoholic beverages to persons under the age of twenty-one is prohibited (ABCL ï¿½65-d).  However, a December 1995 investigative report prepared for the Speaker of the Council and the Council's Youth Services Committee concerning the availability of beer and cigarettes to New York City those under age, entitled Easy Access, found that only fifteen stores, or twenty-three percent of the total of stores visited, displayed any kind of poster or sign prohibiting the sale of alcohol to those under twenty-one. 7  Council investigators visited sixty-five food stores throughout the city and found that on sixty-three occasions or ninety-seven percent of the time, persons below legal age successfully purchased beer.8\n\tYoung people in New York City are exposed to a significant number of billboards and other outdoor advertisements promoting the use of alcoholic beverages.  The Council of the City of New York finds that restricting the placement of advertisements for alcoholic beverages in publicly visible locations within the City of New York is reasonable and necessary for the promotion of the health, safety, welfare, and temperance of young people exposed to such advertisements.  Such restrictions would only limit the \"time, place and manner\" of certain advertisements and will not unduly burden legitimate business activities of persons licensed by the State of New York to sell alcoholic beverages on a retail basis.\n\tIn light of the foregoing evidence that alcoholic beverages are advertised and promoted to young people and that under-age drinking continues to be a problem despite laws banning the sale or distribution of alcoholic beverages to persons under the age of twenty-one, the Council of the City of New York finds and declares that affirmative, reasonable and constitutionally permissible restrictions on alcoholic beverage advertising and promotion may and must be enacted.\n\tThe purpose of this legislation is to promote enforcement of the aforementioned laws banning the sale or distribution of alcoholic beverages to young people and to thereby protect them.  The Council is cognizant of the necessity of acting within the protections afforded by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and has, therefore, narrowly tailored the scope and effect of this legislation to impose reasonable time, place and manner restrictions on alcoholic beverage advertising aimed at or regularly seen by young people while not directly affecting advertising and promotions directed at adults.  Indeed, the Council to narrow the scope of the prohibition on alcoholic beverage advertisements to ensure that such advertisements are restricted only in those locations closest to where young people congregate, and that alcoholic beverage promotions are not given to young people but are otherwise freely available to the adult population.\n\tIt is well settled law that the First Amendment protects commercial speech but to a lesser degree than the protection afforded other, \"fully protected speech.\"  In analyzing the constitutionality of commercial speech regulation, the United States Supreme Court prescribed a four-prong test in Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corporation v. Public Service Commission of New York, 447 U.S. 557 (1980).  The Central Hudson test, which subsequent decisions have ratified and clarified, provides that government restrictions on commercial speech are lawful where:  (1) the commercial speech at issue concerns a lawful activity and is not misleading; (2) the asserted governmental interest in restricting the commercial speech is substantial; (3) the restriction directly advances the governmental interest asserted; and (4) the restrictions are not more extensive than necessary to serve that governmental interest.  The latter two requirements involve a determination that there is a reasonable \"fit\" between the government's ends and the means chosen to accomplish these ends.  Board of Trustees of State Univ. of New York v. Fox, 492 U.S. 469, 480 (1989); see also, United States v. Edge Broadcasting Co., 509 U.S. 418 (1993).\n\tThe restrictions on commercial speech contained in this Council legislation are permissible under the Central Hudson four-prong test.  The commercial speech at issue concerns a lawful activity and is not misleading, at least as it applies to consenting adults.  The governmental interest in restricting the commercial speech at issue is one grounded in the pre-existing prohibition on the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages to persons under the age of twenty-one and is geared directly towards countering the adverse impacts of an industry strategy.  By restricting the locations for advertisements that are more likely to be addressed to and most likely to be seen by young people, specifically to a 1,000 feet from schools, child day care centers and the like, while still permitting alcoholic beverage sellers to notify their customers that such products are available for purchase with a single tombstone advertisement which may be written in any language, this Council legislation directly advances the governmental interest in enforcing the ban on the sale or distribution of alcoholic beverages to young people.  Similarly, by permitting alcoholic beverage promotions to be offered and/or given to anyone of lawful age to purchase alcoholic beverages, this Council legislation restricts only promotions designed to induce young people to purchase those products.  Finally, as the restrictions in this Council legislation focus on modes and locations of communication that are most likely to have a direct impact upon young people, the restrictions contained in this Council legislation strike a balance between the commercial interest in selling alcoholic beverages to persons of lawful age and the need to limit inducements to young people who cannot lawfully purchase such products but are nonetheless doing so.  Thus, the Council legislation is not more extensive than necessary to serve the governmental interests asserted herein.  Other forms of advertising including newspapers, magazines, audio and video media, that are less likely to have a direct impact on young people, and all promotions directed to adults are not affected by this Council legislation.  Moreover, street advertisements not within 1,000 feet of a school, child day care center, youth center, amusement arcade or playground, which can readily reach an adult population, are not affected by this Council legislation.\n\tRuling on a Baltimore ordinance that closely parallels this legislation the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in November 1996 upheld against First Amendment attack legislation prohibiting placement of stationary outdoor advertising of alcoholic beverages in areas where it was likely to be encountered by minors traveling to school or play.  The Baltimore ordinance targeted individuals who could not legally purchase alcoholic beverages.\n\tThis Council's legislation similarly targets persons who may not legally purchase those products.  Neither this legislation nor the Baltimore ordinance were directed toward or intended to affect adults who may legally purchase alcoholic beverages.  Neither this legislation nor the Baltimore ordinance bans all outdoor advertising of alcoholic beverages.  Instead, as did the Baltimore ordinance, this legislation merely restricts the time, place and manner of such advertisements.\n\tThe Council is also aware of the argument that this legislation is or may be preempted under Federal and/or State law but believes that such arguments are not well-taken and that any challenge to this legislation on that basis would not be sustained in a judicial proceeding.\n \tï¿½2.\tSubchapter 7 of chapter 1 of title 27 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 3 for the year 1998, is amended by adding thereto a new article seventeen-B, to follow article seventeen-A, to read as follows:\nARTICLE 17-B\nYOUTH PROTECTION AGAINST ALCOHOL ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION ACT\n\tï¿½27-508.8 Short title.

Declaration of legislative findings and intent.   The Council of the City of New York finds that manufacturers of alcoholic beverages engage in marketing and advertising strategies designed to promote the use of those products by young people to whom it is illegal to sell or distribute these products. Such strategies undermine laws prohibiting the sale or distribution of alcoholic beverages to persons below legal age. Therefore, the Council intends to strengthen compliance with and enforcement of laws prohibiting the sale or distribution of alcoholic beverages to those below the legal drinking age and to protect our young people from such illegal sales.\\par\n\\tab The Council further finds that the exposure of minors to such alcohol product advertising and promotion may be constitutionally restricted through reasonable targeted limitations on the advertising of such products near schools and other locations where young people tend to congregate, and through a prohibition on the offering of promotions to those persons.  \\par\n\\tab According to the New York City Five-Year Plan for Alcoholism Services 1994-1999 (1995 Annual Update pages 4-5) published by the New York City Department of Mental Health, Mental Retardation and Alcoholism Services,  \"Alcohol is the most widely used drug in America.  One out of three American adults -56 million Americans -say alcohol abuse has brought trouble to his or her family.  That is four times the number of families that say that other drugs have troubled their homes.  Children of alcoholics have a four times greater risk of becoming alcoholics than children of non-alcoholics.\"  The annual \"Monitoring The Future Study\" of alcohol and drug use by American students has shown consistently that  \"alcohol is the drug most often used and abused by children and adolescents.\"  See:  American Academy of Pediatrics  Alcohol Use and  Abuse: A Pediatric Concern,  Pediatrics, Vol. 06, No. 3, March 1995, p. 439.\\par\n\\tab It was also reported in the above noted study that in 1992, 88% of American high school seniors had tried alcohol at least once, compared with 82% of tenth graders and 69% of eighth graders.  In that study it was shown that 56% of students in grades five through twelve said that alcohol advertising encouraged them to drink. Over 80% of the adults surveyed by the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in 1988 indicated that they believed that alcohol advertising influences underage youth to drink alcoholic beverages.1\\par\nAlcohol is widely advertised and such advertisements are frequently seen by teenagers on television. Drinking alcohol is portrayed by advertisers as being sophisticated and a natural part of life.2  Even though alcohol use by 12-17-year olds is illegal in every state, in a 1996 study, 39% admitted to use at least once in their lifetime, 33% to past-year use and 19% to past-month use.3\\par\n\\tab Indeed, alcoholic beverages are the second most heavily advertised products in America, and the alcoholic beverage industry spends more than $100 million annually for outdoor advertising of its products.4  Outdoor advertisements are a distinguishable and effective medium of advertising one's product that has the undeniable effect of subjecting the general public to involuntary and unavoidable forms of solicitation.  \\par\nIn one of the most comprehensive studies of alcohol advertising and youth, a team of Colorado State University researchers has found strong ethnic and gender differences in the way adolescents respond to televised beer advertising. The study funded by a $400,000 grant from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism indicated that both male and female adolescents who responded positively to beer ads were more likely to use alcohol or say they planned to drink alcohol as adults.  Adolescents who responded negatively to the ads or were more likely to criticize messages contained in those ads were less likely to use alcohol or have plans to drink alcohol when they reached legal drinking age.5  \\par\n\\tab Fifty-six percent of students in grades five through twelve say that alcohol advertising encourages them to drink.  The United States Surgeon General reports that life expectancy has improved in the United States over the past 75 years for every age group except one: The death rate for 15- to 24- year olds is higher today than it was 20 years ago.  Approximately 2/3 of teenagers who drink report that they can buy their own alcohol and it is estimated that 6.9 million American junior and senior high students can walk into a store and buy their own alcohol. \\par\n\\tab Research consistently showed that children's attitudes favorable to alcohol are significantly related to their exposure to alcohol advertisements.  Children are exposed to billboards advertising alcohol on a regular basis simply by walking to school or playing in their neighborhood, and there is no practical means of monitoring or limiting exposure to these public advertisements.6 \\par\n\\tab The New York State Alcoholic Beverage Control Law (ABCL) mandates that any person with a license to sell alcoholic beverages must display a sign stating that the sale of alcoholic beverages to persons under the age of twenty-one is prohibited (ABCL \\'a765-d).  However, a December 1995 investigative report prepared for the Speaker of the Council and the Council's Youth Services Committee concerning the availability of beer and cigarettes to New York City those under age, entitled Easy Access, found that only fifteen stores, or twenty-three percent of the total of stores visited, displayed any kind of poster or sign prohibiting the sale of alcohol to those under twenty-one. 7  Council investigators visited sixty-five food stores throughout the city and found that on sixty-three occasions or ninety-seven percent of the time, persons below legal age successfully purchased beer.8\\par\n\\tab Young people in New York City are exposed to a significant number of billboards and other outdoor advertisements promoting the use of alcoholic beverages.  The Council of the City of New York finds that restricting the placement of advertisements for alcoholic beverages in publicly visible locations within the City of New York is reasonable and necessary for the promotion of the health, safety, welfare, and temperance of young people exposed to such advertisements.  Such restrictions would only limit the \"time, place and manner\" of certain advertisements and will not unduly burden legitimate business activities of persons licensed by the State of New York to sell alcoholic beverages on a retail basis.\\par\n\\tab In light of the foregoing evidence that alcoholic beverages are advertised and promoted to young people and that under-age drinking continues to be a problem despite laws banning the sale or distribution of alcoholic beverages to persons under the age of twenty-one, the Council of the City of New York finds and declares that affirmative, reasonable and constitutionally permissible restrictions on alcoholic beverage advertising and promotion may and must be enacted.\\par\n\\tab The purpose of this legislation is to promote enforcement of the aforementioned laws banning the sale or distribution of alcoholic beverages to young people and to thereby protect them.  The Council is cognizant of the necessity of acting within the protections afforded by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and has, therefore, narrowly tailored the scope and effect of this legislation to impose reasonable time, place and manner restrictions on alcoholic beverage advertising aimed at or regularly seen by young people while not directly affecting advertising and promotions directed at adults.  Indeed, the Council to narrow the scope of the prohibition on alcoholic beverage advertisements to ensure that such advertisements are restricted only in those locations closest to where young people congregate, and that alcoholic beverage promotions are not given to young people but are otherwise freely available to the adult population.\\par\n\\tab It is well settled law that the First Amendment protects commercial speech but to a lesser degree than the protection afforded other, \"fully protected speech.\"  In analyzing the constitutionality of commercial speech regulation, the United States Supreme Court prescribed a four-prong test in Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corporation v. Public Service Commission of New York, 447 U.S. 557 (1980).  The Central Hudson test, which subsequent decisions have ratified and clarified, provides that government restrictions on commercial speech are lawful where:  (1) the commercial speech at issue concerns a lawful activity and is not misleading; (2) the asserted governmental interest in restricting the commercial speech is substantial; (3) the restriction directly advances the governmental interest asserted; and (4) the restrictions are not more extensive than necessary to serve that governmental interest.  The latter two requirements involve a determination that there is a reasonable \"fit\" between the government's ends and the means chosen to accomplish these ends.  Board of Trustees of State Univ. of New York v. Fox, 492 U.S. 469, 480 (1989); see also, United States v. Edge Broadcasting Co., 509 U.S. 418 (1993).\\par\n\\tab The restrictions on commercial speech contained in this Council legislation are permissible under the Central Hudson four-prong test.  The commercial speech at issue concerns a lawful activity and is not misleading, at least as it applies to consenting adults.  The governmental interest in restricting the commercial speech at issue is one grounded in the pre-existing prohibition on the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages to persons under the age of twenty-one and is geared directly towards countering the adverse impacts of an industry strategy.  By restricting the locations for advertisements that are more likely to be addressed to and most likely to be seen by young people, specifically to a 1,000 feet from schools, child day care centers and the like, while still permitting alcoholic beverage sellers to notify their customers that such products are available for purchase with a single tombstone advertisement which may be written in any language, this Council legislation directly advances the governmental interest in enforcing the ban on the sale or distribution of alcoholic beverages to young people.  Similarly, by permitting alcoholic beverage promotions to be offered and/or given to anyone of lawful age to purchase alcoholic beverages, this Council legislation restricts only promotions designed to induce young people to purchase those products.  Finally, as the restrictions in this Council legislation focus on modes and locations of communication that are most likely to have a direct impact upon young people, the restrictions contained in this Council legislation strike a balance between the commercial interest in selling alcoholic beverages to persons of lawful age and the need to limit inducements to young people who cannot lawfully purchase such products but are nonetheless doing so.  Thus, the Council legislation is not more extensive than necessary to serve the governmental interests asserted herein.  Other forms of advertising including newspapers, magazines, audio and video media, that are less likely to have a direct impact on young people, and all promotions directed to adults are not affected by this Council legislation.  Moreover, street advertisements not within 1,000 feet of a school, child day care center, youth center, amusement arcade or playground, which can readily reach an adult population, are not affected by this Council legislation.\\par\n\\tab Ruling on a Baltimore ordinance that closely parallels this legislation the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in November 1996 upheld against First Amendment attack legislation prohibiting placement of stationary outdoor advertising of alcoholic beverages in areas where it was likely to be encountered by minors traveling to school or play.  The Baltimore ordinance targeted individuals who could not legally purchase alcoholic beverages.\\par\n\\tab This Council's legislation similarly targets persons who may not legally purchase those products.  Neither this legislation nor the Baltimore ordinance were directed toward or intended to affect adults who may legally purchase alcoholic beverages.  Neither this legislation nor the Baltimore ordinance bans all outdoor advertising of alcoholic beverages.  Instead, as did the Baltimore ordinance, this legislation merely restricts the time, place and manner of such advertisements.\\par\n\\tab The Council is also aware of the argument that this legislation is or may be preempted under Federal and/or State law but believes that such arguments are not well-taken and that any challenge to this legislation on that basis would not be sustained in a judicial proceeding.\\par\n \\tab\\'a72.\\tab Subchapter 7 of chapter 1 of title 27 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 3 for the year 1998, is amended by adding thereto a new article seventeen-B, to follow article seventeen-A, to read as follows:\\par\n\\pard\\ltrpar\\sl480\\slmult1\\qc ARTICLE 17-B\\par\nYOUTH PROTECTION AGAINST ALCOHOL ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION ACT\\par\n\\pard\\ltrpar\\sl480\\slmult1\\tab\\'a727-508.8 Short title.
