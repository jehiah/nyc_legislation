  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n      Section 1. Legislative findings and intent. The council finds that food vendors and general vendors play an important role in the economic life of New York City by providing a livelihood for many New Yorkers and by making available meals, snacks and merchandise that are relatively inexpensive and may be purchased and consumed quickly. It is also found that street vending activities present to the City an opportunity to obtain significant revenues, not only from the income and business taxes generated by the vendors and other related businesses, such as suppliers of the food and merchandise sold, but also from fees for the use of the City's public spaces and streets. Consequently, it is important that the system by which food and general vendors are authorized to conduct their businesses, and the methods by which these businesses are operated, assures fairness to consumers and effectively protects their health, is fair to the vendors, respects the concerns of other merchants and brings to the City the maximum amount of revenue. One mechanism for achieving the latter is altering the licensing and permitting structure to allocate vending locations in designated zones through a competitive bidding process.\n      However, the council remains aware that street vending is never appropriate on certain City thoroughfares and is inappropriate during certain days and times of day on other streets. Any scheme for the regulation of street vendors must also accommodate these concerns but must at the same time not allow restrictions of this nature, and the method of establishing those restrictions, to be used as a mechanism for sanitizing the cityscape.   \n   \t�2. Section 17-306 of the administrative code of the city of New York, is amended by amending subdivision i and by adding thereto a new subdivision q to read as follows:\n      i.  \"Person\". A natural person, partnership, corporation or other [association] business entity.\n      q.  \"Blockface\".  The area of a sidewalk on each side of a street spanning from one intersection to the next. \n      �3. Paragraph 2 and subparagraphs a and b of paragraph 3 of subdivision b of section 17-307 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 15 for the year 1995 and subparagraph c of paragraph 3 of subdivision b of section 17-307, as amended by local law 27 of 1997, are amended to read as follows:\n      2. (a)  (i) On and after [July thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty-three] March twenty-fourth, nineteen hundred ninety-eight, [no new full-term] permits shall be issued until the number of such permits which are in effect is [less than] three thousand. Thereafter, the maximum number of such permits which may be in effect shall be three thousand and no new permits shall be issued in excess of such maximum number, except that the number of permits shall be increased by the number of permits that were issued as temporary permits or are subject to renewal as temporary permits as of March twenty-fourth, nineteen hundred ninety-eight. Thereafter, the number of permits shall be reduced as permits that were issued as temporary permits are not renewed.\n        Notwithstanding the limitations on the issuance of new [full-term] permits, a permit issued prior to [July thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty-three] March twenty-fourth, nineteen hundred ninety-eight which is in effect shall be renewable by the licensee to whom the permit was issued subject to the provisions of subparagraph (f) of this paragraph and provided that all other requirements for renewal under the provisions of this subchapter and any rules promulgated pursuant thereto are complied with, the license of the person to whom the permit was issued or the permit has not been revoked or suspended and the licensee has not committed a violation or violations which could be a basis for permit or license revocation or suspension.\n      (ii)  No more than two hundred fifty permits and no fewer than one hundred twenty-five permits shall be issued within the midtown east food vending zone, no more than one hundred fifty permits and no fewer than seventy-five permits shall be issued within the midtown west food vending zone, no more than one hundred fifty permits and no fewer than seventy-five permits shall be issued within the midtown south food vending zone, no more than one hundred fifty permits and no fewer than one hundred fifty permits shall be issued within the downtown food vending zone, no more than one hundred fifty permits and no fewer than seventy-five permits shall be issued within the westside food vending zone and no more than one hundred fifty permits and no fewer than seventy-five permits shall be issued within the eastside food vending zone. Furthermore, within any of such zones no more than two permits may be issued for any blockface, no more than two permits may be issued for any corner and no more than four permits may be issued for any intersection. \n      (b)(i) On and after March [fifteenth, nineteen hundred ninety-five] twenty-fourth, nineteen hundred ninety-eight, without increasing the number of [full-term] permits which may be in effect in accordance with subparagraph (a) of this paragraph, two hundred [full-term] permits shall be designated for use exclusively in specified boroughs as follows:\n      (A) fifty of such [full-term] permits shall authorize the holders thereof to vend food from any vehicle or pushcart in any public place in the borough of the Bronx where food vendors are not prohibited from vending;\n      (B) fifty of such [full-term] permits shall authorize the holders thereof to vend food from any vehicle or pushcart in any public place in the borough of Brooklyn where food vendors are not prohibited from vending;\n      (C) fifty of such [full-term] permits shall authorize the holders thereof to vend food from any vehicle or pushcart in any public place in the borough of Queens where food vendors are not prohibited from vending; and\n      (D) fifty of such [full-term] permits shall authorize the holders thereof to vend food from any vehicle or pushcart in any public place in the borough of Staten Island where food vendors are not prohibited from vending.\n      (ii) After the initial issuance of such permits, the commissioner shall establish a separate waiting list for each of the relevant boroughs to be administered in accordance with procedures to be established by rules of the commissioner.  The commissioner may by rule limit the number of places on each such waiting list.\n      (c) On and after [January first, nineteen hundred ninety-five] March twenty-fourth [VGC1][VGC2], nineteen hundred ninety-eight, [full-term] permits shall be issued only to persons who at the time of application for a permit have not had a [full-term] permit revoked or suspended and who satisfy the commissioner that they are fit and able to conduct, maintain or operate a food vending business. Except as otherwise provided in item (B) of clause (ii) of subparagraph (a) of paragraph three of subdivision f of this section, no person shall be issued more than one permit[, whether full-term or temporary].\n      (d) The issuance or renewal of a [full-term] permit pursuant to this subchapter shall be subject to the permittee [within three months after the certification of a complete application therefor] presenting a pushcart or vehicle for inspection by the department and [within six months after such certification,] passing such inspection.\n      (e) The commissioner shall establish a separate waiting list for the issuance of [full-term] permits pursuant to this subchapter to be administered in accordance with requirements to be established by rules of the commissioner.  The commissioner may by rule limit the number of places the permit has not been revoked or suspended and such person has not committed a violation or violations which could be a basis for permit or license suspension or revocation.\n      (f) Except as otherwise provided in item (B) of clause (ii) of subparagraph (a) of paragraph three of subdivision f of this section, on and after [January first, nineteen hundred ninety-six] March twenty-fourth, nineteen hundred ninety-eight, and on every renewal date thereafter, a permit holder may not renew more than one permit [whether full-time or temporary]. Such permit shall be renewed provided that all other requirements for renewal under the provisions of this subchapter and any rules promulgated pursuant thereto are complied with, the license of the person to whom the permit was issued or the permit has not been revoked or suspended and such person has not committed a violation or violations which could be a basis for permit or license suspension or renewal.\n      3.

No person shall be issued more than one permit.  Such permits shall be issued in the order in which applications for such permits are received in accordance with the preferences specified in subparagraph (b) of this paragraph and the procedures established by the commissioner.  The issuance or renewal of a [full-term] permit pursuant to this paragraph shall be subject to the permittee [within three months after the certification of a complete application therefor] presenting a pushcart or vehicle for inspection by the department and[, within six months after such certification,] passing such inspection.  After the initial issuance of such permits, the commissioner shall establish a waiting list, not to exceed four hundred in number, to be administered in accordance with procedures to be established by rules of the commissioner.\n      (b) Preferences shall be given in the issuance of permits pursuant to this paragraph and in the placement on such waiting list to the following categories of persons in the following order:\n      (i) Veterans who on August second, nineteen hundred ninety-one held a valid general vendor's license issued by the department of consumer affairs pursuant to subchapter twenty-seven of chapter two of title twenty of the code by virtue of having claimed a disability.\n      (ii) Disabled veterans.\n      (iii) Disabled persons.\n      (iv) Veterans.\n      (c) A person who has been issued a permit pursuant to this paragraph shall not be eligible to obtain a [full-term] permit authorized by paragraph two of this subdivision if at the time of application for a [full-term] permit authorized by such paragraph two such person is a holder of a [full-term] permit issued pursuant to this paragraph or such person has had a [full-term] permit issued.\n      �4.  Subparagraph a of paragraph three of subdivision f of section 17-307 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 15 for the year 1995, is amended to read as follows:\n      3.

Subdivisions c and d of section 17-314.1 of subchapter 2 of chapter 3 of title 17 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as enacted by local law number fifteen for the year nineteen hundred ninety-five, is amended to read as follows: \n      c. A transfer in violation of this section shall be deemed to have occurred where, if a corporation is the permittee, there has been a change in fifty percent or more of the ownership interest in such corporation from the ownership interest existing on the date the permit was issued, or where the permittee is a limited liability company, where there has been the addition of any member, and where the permittee is a partnership, where there has been the addition of any partner. Furthermore, any such transfer in an exclusive distributor or a manufacturer who has been issued more than one [temporary] permit pursuant to item (B) of clause (ii) of subparagraph (a) of paragraph three of subdivision f of section 17-307 of this subchapter shall result in the automatic revocation of all such additional [temporary] permits issued to such persons pursuant to such provision.\n      �13.  Paragraph 2 of subdivision d of section 17-314.1 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as enacted by local law number fifteen for the year nineteen hundred ninety-five, is amended to read as follows: \n\n      2. an exclusive distributor or a manufacturer who has been issued more than one [temporary] permit pursuant to item (B) of clause (ii) of subparagraph (a) of paragraph three of subdivision f of section 17-307 of this subchapter may lease a vehicle or pushcart owned by such exclusive distributor or manufacturer with such exclusive distributor's or manufacturer's [temporary] permit attached thereto to a person licensed as a food vendor pursuant to this subchapter if (a) such exclusive distributor or manufacturer files with the department the bill of sale or other proof of ownership for such vehicle or pushcart with a duly issued sales tax receipt attached thereto; b) such lease agreement sets forth the food product which may be primarily sold using such vehicle or pushcart; and (c) such lease agreement is approved by the department, provided, however, that if such lease agreement is not approved or disapproved within thirty calendar days after such lease agreement is filed with the department, such lease agreement shall be deemed to be approved by the department.  The commissioner shall promulgate rules establishing the standards by which the department shall evaluate such lease agreements and such standards shall include, but not be limited to, requirements that such lease agreements contain fair and reasonable terms based upon such factors as the cost of purchasing and maintaining such pushcart or vehicle and that the terms of such lease agreement are the result of an arm's length negotiation between the parties thereto.

Authorized officers and employees of the department of business services and the department of investigation may assist the commissioner and the department in effectuating the provisions of this paragraph.  Any violation or violations of the provisions of this paragraph or any rules promulgated hereunder by an exclusive distributor or a manufacturer who has been issued more than one [temporary] permit pursuant to item (B) of clause (ii) of subparagraph (a) of paragraph three of subdivision f of section 17-307 of this subchapter may be the basis for suspension or revocation of all of the permits issued to such exclusive distributor or manufacturer pursuant to this subchapter.\n      �14.

Legislative findings and intent. The council finds that food vendors and general vendors play an important role in the economic life of New York City by providing a livelihood for many New Yorkers and by making available meals, snacks and merchandise that are relatively inexpensive and may be purchased and consumed quickly. It is also found that street vending activities present to the City an opportunity to obtain significant revenues, not only from the income and business taxes generated by the vendors and other related businesses, such as suppliers of the food and merchandise sold, but also from fees for the use of the City\\rquote s public spaces and streets. Consequently, it is important that the system by which food and general vendors are authorized to conduct their businesses, and the methods by which these businesses are operated, assures fairness to consumers and effectively protects their health, is fair to the vendors, respects the concerns of other merchants and brings to the City the maximum amount of revenue. One mechanism for achieving the latter is altering the licensing and permitting structure to allocate vending locations in designated zones through a competitive bidding process.\\par\nHowever, the council remains aware that street vending is never appropriate on certain City thoroughfares and is inappropriate during certain days and times of day on other streets. Any scheme for the regulation of street vendors must also accommodate these concerns but must at the same time not allow restrictions of this nature, and the method of establishing those restrictions, to be used as a mechanism for sanitizing the cityscape.   \\par\n\\pard\\ltrpar\\nowidctlpar\\sl480\\slmult1\\qj\\tx720    \\tab\\'a72.
