The commissioner[, in his or her discretion, may] shall permit any such premises [licensed hereunder] to be open to the public between such hours on special occasions provided that the occupant of such premises demonstrates that the nature and duration of the occasion are such that the occasion will not create unreasonable noise, crowd control or traffic congestion problems in the community in which such premises are located.\n    \t    \tb.  If it appears to the commissioner after due notice and an opportunity for a hearing that the [place for which a license is sought will be frequented by minors, or if there is in the opinion of the commissioner any other good and sufficient reason therefor] operation at or after one ante meridian of premises that are not required to be licensed by the state liquor authority creates unreasonable noise, crowd control or traffic congestion problems in the community in which such premises are located, he or she may [grant] deny renewal or may suspend or revoke a license [upon] issued under this subchapter unless the licensee agrees to the condition that the licensed premises shall [not] be [open] closed for business between one ante meridian and eight ante meridian.\n    \t�20-368 Rules [and regulations].

The commissioner may suspend or revoke a license for conduct of the licensee, its officers, principals, directors, agents or employees or in a closely held corporation, stockholders that would constitute grounds for denying the issuance of renewal of a license pursuant to section 20-361 of this subchapter.\n    \t    \t(b) \tUpon application to the commissioner and prior to the reinstatement or reissuance of a suspended or revoked license, the licensee, with the commissioner's approval, shall, upon payment of the fee as specified in section 20-362 of this code, be permitted to operate for six months on a probationary license. At the end of such six month period, the license shall be reinstated or reissued unless the commissioner finds that the licensee, its officers, principals, directors, agents or employees or, in a closely held corporation, stockholders, have engaged in conduct that would constitute grounds for denying the issuance or renewal of a license pursuant to section 20-361 of this code. Upon a finding of such conduct the probationary license shall be revoked and shall not be reissued for a period of one year.]\n    \t[20-370 permit for a public, masquerade or fancy dress dance or ball; fee.

It shall be unlawful for a licensee to permit the licensed premises to be used for such a dance or ball unless the person holding such dance or ball has secured a permit from the commissioner to hold such dance or ball.  Such permit shall be issued only upon condition that the dance or ball shall be held in accordance with the rules and regulations adopted by the commissioner.  The commissioner is authorized to adopt reasonable rules and regulations for the holding of such dances and balls for the purpose of preventing thereat any fraudulent solicitation of monies or any disorderly or immoral behavior or conduct calculated to disturb the public peace or safety.  Application for such permit shall be made to the commissioner upon such forms as he or she may prescribe.  A fee of ten dollars shall be paid for each such permit.  Such permit may at any time be revoked by the commissioner in case it appears probable that the dance or ball for which the permit has been issued will not be conducted in accordance with such rules and regulations.  A permit issued pursuant to this section, in the discretion of the commissioner, may provide that such dance or ball may be continued between four ante meridian and eight ante meridian; and in such case the license issued for the premises in which such dance or ball is to be conducted shall not be deemed violated by reason of the fact that such premises are open to the public between such hours.  No such dance or ball can be held in a premises licensed only as a catering establishment.]\n    \t�3.  Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of law, any public dance hall license issued by the commissioner of consumer affairs prior to the effective date of this local law which is in effect on such effective date shall continue in effect as if it constituted a patron dancing establishment license issued by the commissioner of consumer affairs pursuant to section 20-360 of the administrative code of the city of New York as amended by section two of this local law, provided that the establishment for which the public dance hall license had been issued constitutes a patron dancing establishment as such term is defined in section 20-359 of such code as amended by section two of this local law, and provided further that the holder of such public dance hall license files an application for a patron dancing establishment license with the department of consumer affairs within 60 days after such effective date.
