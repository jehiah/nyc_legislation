  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n     \tSection 1.  Declaration of legislative findings and intent.\n \tIt is hereby declared and found that the health, safety, and welfare of the people of the city of New York require that the administration of multiple dwellings be adequate and proper, and that the quality of such housing is related to the calibre of training and experience of the persons owning and managing such multiple dwellings.  This article establishes standards of education, training, and experience and provides for the examination and licensing of multiple dwelling owners, landlords, managing agents, managers, developers, sponsors, and principals.\n     \tLicensing is essential in protecting the public against unlawful, dishonest, and harmful practices by the owners, landlords, managing agents, managers, developers, sponsors, and principals of multiple dwellings.  Licensing will also minimize incompetent practices, decrease the number of existing and recurring housing code violations, and promote higher standards of efficiency in the housing industry.  The city council finds that the enactment of a comprehensive licensing requirement for owners, landlords, managing agents, managers, developers, sponsors, and principals of multiple dwellings will best protect the citizens of New York City and that the provisions of this local law are necessary and designed to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare.\n     \t�2. \tSubchapter 4 of chapter 2 of article 27 of the administrative code of the city of New York is hereby amended by adding a new article 3 to read as follows:\n\tArticle 3\n\tMultiple Dwelling Owner, Landlord, Managing\n\tAgent, Manager, Developer, Sponsor, and \n\t Principal License\n     \t�27-2109.1  Definitions.
