  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection one. Declaration and legislative findings. The City Council finds that many multiple dwellings in the City of New York do not provide consistent designations so that visitors, in particular emergency service personnel, can enter a multiple dwelling and be able to quickly and accurately determine which apartment they desire and where it is located. Many directories or buzzer systems in multiple dwellings display different numbers and letters than that which appear on apartment doors. This lack of uniformity has led to delays in responding to emergency situations. The Council has determined that it is necessary to enact legislation which requires owners of multiple dwellings to conform designations within each building.\n\t�2. Article 12 of subchapter one of chapter two of title twenty-seven of the administrative code of the City of New York is hereby amended by adding a new section 27-2048.1 to read as follows:\n\t�27-2048.1. Apartment designations. a. For the purpose of the section, the term \"multiple dwelling unit\" shall mean an apartment, a rooming unit or a dwelling unit as such are defined in the housing maintenance code.\n\tb. All references to a multiple dwelling unit designation shall be uniformly stated on the multiple dwelling unit, the building directory, the building's intercommunication system, any bell/buzzer system including one which permits the occupant of a unit to release the locking mechanism on the door to the main entrance hall lobby, and the appropriate mailbox, and shall be consistent with any number assigned to the floor on which the multiple dwelling unit is situated and which is posted within a staircase enclosure or appears on elevator floor buttons. For purposes of this section, \"designation\" shall mean any number and any letter assigned to a multiple dwelling unit, apartment, rooming unit or dwelling unit.\n\t�3.
