  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n \tSection 1.  Subdivision h of section 27-2013 of the administrative code of the city of New York is REPEALED.\n      \t�2. \tSubchapter 2 of chapter 2 of title 27 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new article 14 to read as follows:\n\tArticle 14\n\tLead Poisoning Prevention and Control\n�27-2056.1 \tStatement of Findings and Purposes.\n�27-2056.2\tDefinitions.\n�27-2056.3\tOwners' Duty to Correct.\n�27-2056.4\tOwners' Duty to Notify Tenants and Investigate.\n\n�27-2056.5\tPresumption.\n�27-2056.6\tViolation in a Dwelling Unit.\n�27-2056.7\tViolation in Common Areas of a Multiple Dwelling.\n�27-2056.8\tViolation in a Dwelling Unit Upon Vacancy or by Rule of the Department.\n�27-2056.9 \tDepartment Inspections.\n�27-2056.10\tDepartment Implementation and Enforcement.\n�27-2056.11\tWork Practices.\n�27-2056.12\tReporting.\n�27-2056.13\tTransmittal of Violations to the Department of Health.\n�27-2056.14\tRequest to the Department from the Department of Health to Execute an Order Pursuant to � 17-147 of the Administrative Code.\n�27-2056.15\tWaiver of Benefit Void.\n�27-2056.16\tCompliance by the Department.\n\n \t�27-2056.1 Statement of findings and purposes.  The council finds that lead poisoning from paint containing lead is a preventable childhood disease and that the response to the public health crisis caused by lead poisoning of children has remained inadequate despite the enactment of local law number 1 for the year 1982, which was intended to eliminate hazardous housing conditions before a child becomes lead poisoned.  The council further finds that the hazard in multiple dwellings that may occur from paint containing lead is subject to many factors, such as the age of a building and its maintenance.  The council therefore recognizes that it cannot legislate a single maintenance standard for all multiple dwellings to eliminate this hazard.  Instead, the council by enacting this article makes it the duty of every owner of a multiple dwelling to investigate dwelling units for lead-based paint hazards and to address such hazards on a case-by-case basis as the conditions may warrant, taking such actions that are necessary to prevent a child from becoming lead poisoned.  Having established this duty, the council finds that sufficient information exists to guide owners in making determinations about the existence of lead-based paint hazards.  See, e.g., United States environmental protection agency, \"Guidance on Identification of Lead-Based Paint Hazards,\" Federal Register, Vol. 60, No. 175 ( September 11, 1995); United States department of housing and urban development, \"Guidelines for the Evaluation and Control of Lead-Based Paint Hazards in Housing\" (June 1995).\n \tThe council further finds that in any dwelling unit where a child under the age of six resides, or in the common areas of such dwelling, the existence of lead-based paint constitutes an immediately hazardous condition when it is peeling or located on a deteriorated subsurface.  The council further finds that any deficiency in the maintenance of a dwelling or dwelling unit that, if uncorrected, may cause paint to peel or a painted subsurface to deteriorate is also an immediately hazardous condition.\n \tIn order that the department of housing preservation and development may secure the appropriate correction of these immediately hazardous conditions, this article makes the conditions stated herein, or established by rules pursuant to this article, a class C immediately hazardous violation under the code.  The council declares that it is reasonable and necessary for the department to diligently perform its duties so that the hazardous conditions identified in this article shall be eradicated from all applicable housing to the maximum extent possible.\n \tAccording to the federal centers for disease control and prevention, a child whose blood-lead level is equal to or exceeds 20 micrograms per deciliter is seriously lead poisoned, requiring immediate hospitalization or clinical evaluation and treatment.  In fiscal year 1996, the New York city department of health identified 1,621 children whose blood-lead level was equal to or exceeded 20 micrograms per deciliter and the department projected it would identify 2,370 more cases in fiscal year 1997.  In every case of a lead poisoned child at this blood-lead level, the city is required under its health code to conduct an environmental investigation for the source of a child s lead poisoning.  The city must incur the expense of this investigation as well as other costs, including a child s medical treatment and remedial education.  In addition, the New York state department of health has reported a blood-lead testing rate for children residing in the city of New York of only 63%, even though the testing of all children under the age of six is mandatory under state law.  The council finds this high incidence of lead poisoning and low rate of blood-lead testing to constitute a public health crisis.\n \tThe council declares that it is reasonable and necessary to increase the rate of blood-lead testing in fiscal years 2000 and 2002 to 75% and 90%, respectively, and to reduce the number of children who become lead poisoned to less than 1,000 and 750, respectively.  In the event that any of these goals are not achieved, this local law requires the department of health to make recommendations to the council to amend the law as necessary to achieve such goal.\n \tThe council further finds that the administration and enforcement of local law number 1 for the year 1982 is unnecessarily divided among several agencies of the city, causing confusion and inefficiency.  While it is intended that the department of housing preservation and development remain the agency responsible for the implementation and enforcement of this article, it is also intended that the department of health shall have the primary responsibility for promulgating and interpreting  rules, regulations, and procedures as well as  monitoring pursuant to this article.\n \t�27-2056.2 Definitions.  Whenever used in this article:\n \t(1)   \"Deteriorated subsurface\" shall mean an unstable or unsound subsurface, including but not limited to, rotted or decayed wood, or wood or plaster that has been subject to moisture or disturbance.\n \t(2) \t\"Lead-based paint hazard\" shall mean any condition in a multiple dwelling that causes exposure to lead from lead-contaminated dust, lead-contaminated soil, or lead-based paint that is peeling or present in accessible surfaces, friction surfaces, or impact surfaces that would result in adverse human health effects.\n \t(3) \t\"Lead-based paint\" shall mean  paint or other similar surface coating material containing 1.0 milligram of lead per square centimeter (mg/cm*) or greater, as determined by laboratory analysis, or by an x-ray fluorescence (XRF) analyzer. If an XRF analyzer is used, readings shall be corrected for substrate bias when necessary as specified by the performance characteristic sheets (PCS) published by the United States environmental protection agency (EPA) for the specific XRF instrument used.  XRF readings shall be classified as positive, negative or inconclusive in accordance with the United States department of housing and urban development (HUD) \"Guidelines for the Evaluation and Control of Lead-Based Paint Hazards in Housing\" (June 1995) and the PCS published by the EPA and HUD for the specific XRF instrument used. XRF readings that fall within the inconclusive zone, as determined by the PCS, shall be confirmed by laboratory analysis of paint chips, results shall be reported in mg/cm* and the measure of such laboratory analysis shall be definitive.  If laboratory analysis is used to determine lead content, results shall be reported in mg/cm*. Where the surface area of a paint chip sample cannot be accurately measured or if an accurately measured paint chip sample cannot be removed, laboratory analysis may be reported in percent by weight. In such case, lead-based paint shall mean any paint or other similar surface-coating material containing more than 0.5% of metallic lead, based on the non-volatile content of the paint or other similar surface-coating material.\n \t(4) \t\"Peeling\" shall mean that the paint or other surface-coating material is curling, cracking, scaling, flaking, blistering, chipping, chalking or loose in any manner, such that a space or pocket of air is behind a portion thereof or such that the paint is not completely adhered to the underlying surface, or that such paint or other surface-coating material is on an unstable or unsound surface including, but not limited to, rotted or decayed wood or wood or plaster that has been subjected to moisture.\n \t(5) \t\"Rule\" or \"rules\" shall mean a rule or rules promulgated pursuant to section 1043 of the New York city charter.\n \t(6) \t\"Underlying defect\" shall mean any condition in a dwelling or dwelling unit, the existence of which constitutes a violation of the housing maintenance code, the building code, the multiple dwelling law, the health code, or any other applicable law,  rule or  regulation, that if uncorrected may cause paint to peel or deteriorate, or a painted subsurface to deteriorate or fail. When correcting an underlying defect, the repair shall eliminate the source of such condition.\n \t(7) \t\"Window\" shall mean the non-glass parts of a window, including but not limited to any window sash, window well, window jamb, window sill, or window molding.\n \t�27-2056.3 Owners' Duty to Correct. The existence of a lead-based paint hazard in any multiple dwelling where a child under six years of age resides is hereby declared to constitute a condition dangerous to life and health.  An owner shall take action to prevent the occurrence of such a condition and shall expeditiously correct such a condition when it exists.  If the lead-based paint hazard is caused in whole or in part by an underlying defect, an owner shall correct the underlying defect to prevent a further lead-based paint hazard.\n \t�27-2056.4.  Owners' Duty to Notify Tenants and to Investigate.\n \ta.  \tIn any multiple dwelling unit where a child under six years of age resides, and in common areas, as defined in section 27-2056.7 of this article, the owner shall cause an investigation to be made for lead-based paint hazards at least once a year and more often if necessary, such as when an owner knows or should have known of a condition that may cause a lead-based paint hazard, a tenant makes a complaint of a lead-based paint hazard or requests an inspection, or the department issues a notice of violation or orders the correction of a violation.  It shall be the duty of each owner to ascertain whether such a child resides therein.\n \tb.  \tNo tenant in a dwelling unit shall refuse or unreasonably fail to provide accurate and truthful information regarding the residency of a child under six years of age therein, nor shall refuse access to the owner at a reasonable time to any part of the premises for the purpose of investigation and repair of lead-based paint hazards.\n \tc.  \tAll leases offered to tenants in multiple dwellings must contain a notice, conspicuously set forth therein, which advises tenants of the obligation of the owner as set forth in subdivision a of this section and of the obligation of the tenant as set forth in subdivision b of this section.  The owner shall provide the tenant with the pamphlet described in subdivision e of section 27-2056.9 of this article.\n \td.  \tEach year, an owner shall deliver to each residential unit a notice inquiring as to whether a child under six years of age resides therein.  If, subsequent to delivery of such notice, the owner does not have a written response from the tenant, and does not otherwise have actual knowledge as to whether a child under six years of age resides therein, then the owner at reasonable times shall inspect the dwelling unit to ascertain the residency of a child under six years of age and, when necessary, conduct an investigation pursuant to subdivision a of this section.\n \te.  \tThe owner shall inform the tenant in writing of the results of an investigation pursuant to this section and shall provide a copy of any such report received or generated by an investigation.  The owner shall retain a copy of each investigation report, and such report shall be made available to the department on request and to the owner's successor in title.\n \tf.  \tAny owner who violates the provisions of this section, or the rules promulgated hereunder, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to five hundred dollars or imprisonment for up to six months or both.  In addition, any violation of this section shall constitute a civil violation subject to a penalty of not more than one thousand five hundred dollars per violation.\n \t�27-2056.5 Presumption. \tIn any multiple dwelling erected prior to January 1, 1960, it shall be presumed that the paint or other similar surface-coating material in the interior of the dwelling or dwelling unit is lead-based paint.  The presumption established in this section may be rebutted by the owner of the multiple dwelling.  An owner may rebut such presumption by submitting to the department a sworn written statement, supported by lead-based paint testing or sampling results, a sworn written statement by the person who performed the testing if performed by an employee or agent of the owner, and such other proof that the department may require.\n \t�27-2056.6 Violation in a Dwelling Unit.  The existence of lead-based paint in any dwelling unit where a child under six years of age resides shall constitute a class C immediately hazardous violation if such paint is peeling or is on a deteriorated subsurface.\n \t�27-2056.7 Violation in Common Areas of a Multiple Dwelling.  The existence of lead-based paint in any portion of a multiple dwelling that is generally accessible to all occupants, including, but not limited to, a public hall, stair, lobby or window, shall constitute a class C immediately hazardous violation if such paint is peeling or is on a deteriorated subsurface.\n \t�27-2056.8 Violation in a Dwelling Unit Upon Vacancy or by Rule of the Department.  a.  When any dwelling unit becomes vacant, or on such earlier date as may be established by rule pursuant to subdivision b of this section in a dwelling unit in which a child under six years of age resides, the owner of a multiple dwelling erected prior to January 1, 1960 shall have the duty to:\n \t(1) \teliminate all peeling paint and repair all deteriorated subsurfaces and underlying defects using work practices that will minimize and contain the generation of lead-contaminated dust;\n \t(2) \tprovide for the permanent removal or covering of all lead-based paint on all friction surfaces of windows and on the friction surfaces of doors and door frames;\n \t(3) \tprovide smooth and cleanable horizontal surfaces, including floors, window sills and window wells, so that dust can be removed by normal cleaning without special equipment;\n \t(4) \trepaint all areas where work was performed pursuant to this section;\n \t(5) \tprior to reoccupancy, perform specialized cleaning to remove lead-contaminated dust in all affected areas in accordance with procedures issued by the department of health; and\n \t(6) \tany additional actions that the department of health by rule shall establish.\n \tb.  \tThe commissioner of the department of health in conjunction with the department shall establish a schedule for compliance with this section prior to vacancy in dwelling units in which a child under six years of age resides.  In establishing such schedule, the commissioner shall consider the age of a multiple dwelling and other factors relevant to the prevalence of lead-based paint hazards, including but not limited to outstanding violations, emergency repair charges, tax arrears and mortgage debt.  Such schedule shall also require compliance in all such dwelling units by July 1, 2005.\n \tc.  \tAny person who fails to comply with the provisions of subdivision a or b of this section in accordance with the rules of the department of health or the department shall be liable for a class C immediately hazardous violation.\n \t�27-2056.9    \tDepartment Inspections. \ta.  \tWhen entering a dwelling unit in a dwelling constructed prior to January 1, 1960, for the purpose of investigating the existence of any violation of this code, the department shall make diligent efforts to ascertain whether a child under the age of six resides therein.  Whenever a child under the age of six resides in a dwelling unit, the department shall immediately inspect all painted surfaces in the dwelling unit and record in a report of such inspection whether the paint or other similar surface-coating material on each surface inspected is peeling or intact, and shall inspect the entire dwelling unit for evidence of any underlying defect and record in a report the existence or absence of such condition. In determining whether lead-based paint is present in a dwelling unit, the department may use the presumption set forth in section  27-2056.5 of this article.  At the time of the inspection, the department shall provide the occupants of the dwelling unit with the pamphlet described in subdivision e of this section.\n \tb.  \tNotwithstanding the above, when the intended purpose of the inspection is to investigate a complaint concerning a condition under  article eight of subchapter two of this chapter, the department also shall conduct an inspection pursuant to subdivision a of this section either during the course of such inspection or no later than five business days thereafter when the department observes peeling paint in the dwelling unit.\n \tc.  \tIn any dwelling unit in a multiple dwelling where a child under six years of age resides, the department shall conduct an inspection pursuant to subdivision a of this section no later than five business days after the department's receipt of a complaint describing peeling paint, a deteriorated subsurface or an underlying defect in the dwelling unit.  The department shall make diligent efforts to ascertain whether a child under the age of six resides therein.  When a complaint is made about lead-based paint, the department shall inquire as to the condition of the paint throughout the dwelling unit to determine whether an inspection pursuant to this subdivision is required.  Where, upon conducting an inspection, the department determines the existence of a condition constituting a violation of this article, the department shall serve a notice of violation within five additional business days.\n \td.  \tThe department shall establish an inspection program to identify dwellings where children are at risk of lead poisoning from peeling paint or underlying defects in order that inspections may be conducted without the receipt of a complaint, and the department of health in conjunction with the department shall develop interim and permanent strategies to prevent exposure to lead paint and lead-contaminated dust in these dwellings.  A sufficient number of the department's code enforcement personnel shall be dedicated to this inspection program.\n \te.  \tThe department of health shall develop a pamphlet explaining the hazards associated with lead-based paint and describing the procedures to be used when a violation of this article shall be corrected.  The pamphlet shall include appropriate telephone numbers to obtain lead poisoning screening, diagnosis and treatment information  and to report unsafe lead-based paint work practices, and shall in prominent type advise the occupants of the dwelling unit that they are not required to consent to a rent increase for work relating to the correction of a violation of this article.\n \t�27-2056.10 Department Implementation and Enforcement.\n \ta.  \tThe department of health in conjunction with the department shall provide appropriate training for lead-based paint inspection and supervisory personnel and insure that they are well trained.  After December  31, 1998, no department personnel shall conduct an inspection pursuant to this article unless that individual has received such training.  At a minimum, such training shall (1) be equivalent to the training required under regulations issued by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for the certification of inspectors and supervisors, (2) include background information pertaining to applicable state and local lead-based paint laws and guidance on identifying violations in a multiple dwelling, and (3) require that the individual has successfully demonstrated knowledge of the requirements of a certified inspector or certified supervisor, as the case may be, the requirements of this article, and the requirements of section 173.14 of the health code.

Unless specifically stated herein to the contrary, the responsibilities and duties under this article are mandatory.\n      \t�3. \tSection 27-2115 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new subdivision l to read as follows:\n \t(l)(1)   \tNotwithstanding any other provision of law, when the department shall serve a notice of violation to correct a condition that constitutes a violation of article 14 of subchapter 2 of this chapter, the notice of violation shall specify the date by which the violation shall be corrected, which shall be twenty-one days after service of the notice of violation, and the procedure by which the owner, for good cause shown pursuant to this subdivision, may request a postponement.  The notice of violation shall be served by personal delivery to a person in charge of the premises or to the person last registered with the city as the owner or agent, or, by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the person in charge of the premises or to the person last registered with the department as the owner or agent; provided that where a managing agent has registered with the department, such notice of violation shall be served on the managing agent.  Service of the notice of violation shall be deemed completed three days from the date of mailing.   A copy of such notice of violation shall be sent simultaneously by regular mail to the occupant of the dwelling unit that is the subject of such notice of violation.  The department may postpone the date by which a violation shall be corrected upon a showing, made within the time set for correction in the notice, that prompt action to correct the violation has been taken but that full correction cannot be completed within the time provided because of serious technical difficulties, inability to obtain necessary materials, funds or labor, inability to gain access to the dwelling unit wherein the violation exists or such other part of the building as may be necessary to make the required repair.  Such postponement shall not exceed a total of sixty days from the date of service of the notice of violation.  The department may condition such postponement upon the applicant's written agreement to correct all violations placed against the premises by the department or other appropriate governmental agency and to satisfy within an appropriate period of time, all sums owing to the department for repairs made to said premises.  The department may require such other conditions as are deemed necessary to insure correction of the violations within the time set by the postponement.  The department shall provide to the owner and the tenant  a written statement signed and dated by the person making such decision setting forth the reasons for the postponement of the date by which a violation shall be corrected or the reason for the denial of such application for postponement.  Said written statement shall be part of the record of the department.\n \t(2) \tNotwithstanding any other provision of law, the notice of violation shall direct that the correction of each violation cited therein shall be certified to the department.  Such certification shall be made in writing, under oath by the registered owner, a registered officer or director of a corporate owner or by the registered managing agent, supported by copies of surface lead dust clearance tests whenever such tests are required by applicable law, rule or regulation.  Such certification shall be delivered to the department and acknowledgment of receipt therefor obtained or shall be mailed to the department by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, no later than three days after the date set for correction, and shall include the date when each violation was corrected.  Such certification of correction shall be supported by a sworn statement by the person who performed the work if performed by an employee or agent of the owner.  A copy of such certification shall then be mailed not more than twelve calendar days from the date of receipt of notification to the tenant by the department.\n \t(3) \tWhenever the department shall issue a notice of violation to correct a condition that constitutes a violation of article 14 of subchapter 2 of this chapter, the department shall within ten days after the date set for the correction of such violation conduct a final inspection to verify that the violation has been corrected.  Where, upon conducting an inspection, the department determines that a violation has not been corrected, the department within fourteen additional days shall correct such violation.\n \t(4) \tNotwithstanding any other provision of law, except when the department removes a violation from its records pursuant to section 27-2056.5 of this code, the department shall not remove a violation it has recorded nor shall it be deemed that such condition has been corrected unless the records of the department contain written verification that the department has conducted a final inspection of the premises and that such inspection verifies that the condition has been corrected, as well as copies of surface lead dust clearance tests whenever such tests are required by applicable law, rule or regulation.  A copy of the report of the final inspection of a dwelling unit and the status of the violation shall be mailed to the occupants and the owner.\n \t(5) \tNotwithstanding any other provision of law, a person wilfully making a false certification of correction with regard to a notice of violation issued pursuant to article 14 of subchapter 2 of this chapter, in addition to any other civil penalty, shall be subject to a civil penalty of  not less than one thousand dollars nor more than three thousand dollars for each false certification wilfully made, recoverable by the department in a civil action brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, and shall, whenever appropriate, be punished under the provisions of article three of subchapter five of this chapter.\n \t(6) \tNotwithstanding any other provision of law, a person who violates article 14 of subchapter 2 of this chapter shall be subject to a civil penalty of two hundred fifty dollars per day for each violation from the date set for correction in the notice of violation until the date the violation is corrected and certified to the department, and in addition to any civil penalty shall, whenever appropriate, be punished under the provisions of article three of subchapter five of this code.  There shall be a presumption that the condition constituting a violation continues after the service of the notice of violation.  The owner shall be responsible for the correction of all violations placed pursuant to article 14 of subchapter 2 of this chapter, but in an action for civil penalties pursuant to this subdivision may in defense or mitigation of such owner's liability for civil penalties show:\n \t (i) That the condition which constitutes the violation did not exist at the time the violation was placed; or\n \t(ii)  That he or she began to correct the condition which constitutes the violation promptly upon discovering it but that full correction could not be completed expeditiously because of serious technical difficulties, inability to obtain necessary materials, funds or labor, or inability to gain access to the dwelling unit wherein the violation occurs, or such other portion of the building as might be necessary to make the repair, provided that a postponement was made pursuant to this subdivision; or\n \t(iii)  That he or she was unable to obtain a permit or license necessary to correct the violation, provided that diligent and prompt application was made therefor; or\n \t(iv)  That the violation giving rise to the action was caused by the act of negligence, neglect or abuse of another not in the employ or subject to the direction of the owner, except that the owner shall be precluded from showing in defense or mitigation of such owner's liability for civil penalties evidence of any acts occurring, undertaken, or performed by any predecessor in title prior to the owner taking control of the premises.\n \tWhere the aforesaid allegations are made by way of mitigation of penalties, the owner shall show, by competent proof, pertinent financial data and efforts made to obtain necessary materials, funds or labor or to gain access, or to obtain a permit or license and such other evidence as the court may require.\n \tIf the court finds that sufficient mitigating circumstances exist, it may remit all or part of any penalties arising from the violations, but may condition such remission upon a correction of the violation within a time period fixed by the court.\n \t� 4.\tSection 27-2126 of the administrative code of the city of New York is hereby REPEALED.\n \t� 5.\tTitle 17 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 17-179 to read as follows:\n \t�17-179 Department Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment.

Childhood lead poisoning is the number one environmental health hazard facing children today.  Environmental exposure to even low levels of lead increases children's risk of developing permanent reading and learning disabilities, reduced concentration and attention span, hyperactivity and other behavior problems, impaired hearing and lower intelligence quotients.  These problems may persist and adversely affect children's ability to learn and succeed in life.\n \tChildhood lead poisoning is caused by environmental exposure to lead.  The most significant sources of environmental lead are lead-based paint and dust and soil contaminated by lead-based paint.  In school facilities, the danger posed can be controlled by abating lead-based paint hazards and imposing strict requirements to minimize exposure when lead-based paint is disturbed during maintenance work and renovations.\n \tThe Council finds that the board of education of the city of New York currently does not have a formal comprehensive strategy for preventing childhood lead poisoning and controlling exposure to lead-based paint hazards in the public schools.  It is the purpose of this local law to identify the conditions in the public schools where the risk of lead poisoning is the greatest and to set forth what is reasonable and necessary to be performed by the board of education and the department of health to remove that risk to the maximum extent possible.\n \tThe Council furthermore declares that the failure to control lead-based paint hazards pursuant to this local law is a public nuisance and a condition dangerous to the life and health of children who are exposed in the public schools to lead-based paint and dust contaminated by lead-based paint.\n \t�17-811 Presumption.  a.  All paint or similar surface-coating material on the interior and exterior of any school facility erected before January 1, 1985, shall be presumed to be lead-based paint.\n \tb.  \tThe board of education may rebut such presumption of lead-based paint by submitting to the department a sworn written statement, supported by lead-based paint testing or sampling results in a form approved by the department, a sworn written statement by the person who performed the testing, and such other proof that the department may require; notwithstanding, a member of the public shall be provided access to a school to conduct lead-based paint testing or sampling.\n \t�17-812  Worksite Plans and Supervision.  a.  When the expected cost of a lead-based paint project is two thousand five hundred dollars or more, the board of education shall not commence such work before implementing a lead-based paint hazard reduction plan appropriate to a worksite, and all work shall be performed pursuant to such plan.  Such plan shall be available for inspection by the department and by the public.\n \tb.  \tWhen the expected cost of a lead-based paint project is less than two thousand five hundred dollars, the board of education may commence such work without implementing a lead-based paint hazard reduction plan; however, such work shall be completed in a manner required by the department and shall ensure that children and adults are not exposed to lead-based paint or dust contaminated by lead-based paint through its release within or from a worksite.\n \tc.  \tWhen a lead-based paint project is commenced pursuant to subdivision a of this section:\n \t    \t(1) \tall work shall be properly supervised and inspected by an individual who has received certification as a \"certified supervisor\" pursuant to part 745 of title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations; and\n \t    \t(2) \tthe department shall conduct periodic inspections of sufficient frequency and scope during the course of work and final clean-up to ensure that children and adults are not exposed to lead-based paint or dust contaminated by lead-based paint through its release from a worksite and that there is compliance with department regulations.\n \t�17-813  Abatement.  a.  There shall be no peeling lead-based paint in any portion of any school facility where children in special education, pre-kindergarten, kindergarten, or first grade regularly spend time.\n \tb.  \tPeeling lead-based paint and peeling paint of unknown lead content shall be immediately abated in a manner required by the department. \n \tc.  \tEffective September 1, 2000, various surfaces covered with lead-based paint and paint of unknown lead content shall be abated, including interior window sills and window wells accessible to children, other window friction and impact surfaces, and other surfaces in special education, kindergarten and first grade classes determined by the department.  For purposes of this section \"window well\" shall mean the horizontal structure of the window frame that receives the window sash or the trough in which the lower part of the window fits or rests.\n \td.  \tPainted equipment shall have lead-free paint.\n \te.  \tWhenever a condition prohibited by this section is found to exist, the department shall immediately serve an order on the board of education to abate the condition.  In the event such order is not complied with within thirty days of service thereof, the department shall execute such order within thirty days.\n \tf.  \tNothing herein shall limit the department from promulgating rules requiring the abatement of any lead-based paint or paint of unknown lead content on any interior or exterior surface whether peeling or not.\n \tg.  \tThe board of education shall take all feasible and prudent actions to abate lead-based paint when carrying out a lead-based paint project.\n \t�17-814  Department Rules.  The department shall promulgate rules in accordance with the provisions contained in this chapter and such other rules and regulations as may be necessary for the purpose of implementing and carrying out the provisions of this chapter.  Such rules and regulations shall include the following provisions:\n \t    \t(1) \tthe requirement of appropriate written notification to all parents and school employees of the affected school prior to the commencement of work in the school;\n \t    \t(2) \tthe board of education and its contractors shall comply with safety and clean-up procedures to govern a lead-based paint project commenced, as the case may be, pursuant to subdivision (a) or (b) of section 17-812 of this chapter.  Such procedures shall ensure that children and adults are not exposed to lead-based paint or dust contaminated by lead-based paint through its release within or from a worksite;\n \t    \t(3) \texposure to lead-based paint shall be minimized until a hazard is repaired.  Children shall not be present and shall not have access to any room undergoing a lead-based paint project or an abatement until completion of a final clean-up and lead dust clearance testing has been conducted pursuant to department regulations.   Whenever possible, work shall be done during non-class hours, such as evenings, weekends and vacation periods;\n \t    \t(4) \tthe board of education shall establish procedures for continuing maintenance, including regular clean-up of accumulated dust;\n \t    \t(5) \tthe board of education shall develop a school-based and central reporting system for recording all complaints about lead-based paint hazards and the response to such complaints, which shall be made available for public inspection during regular business hours; and\n \t    \t(6) \twhenever the board of education conducts lead-based paint testing at a school facility, the results of such testing shall be placed on file in the office of the principal of such school and shall be made available for public inspection.\n \t�17-815 Semi-annual Survey for Lead-based Paint Hazards.  The board of education shall conduct a semi-annual survey in every school facility to determine the existence of peeling lead-based paint in areas where children in special education, pre-kindergarten, kindergarten, or first grade regularly spend time and shall provide a copy of the survey results to the department.\n \t�17-816 Reporting. \tNot later than fifteen months after the effective date of this local law, and every year thereafter, the board of education shall submit a report to the mayor and the council concerning the administration and enforcement of this subchapter.\n \t�17-817  Compliance by Department.  An action or proceeding may be brought against the department to compel promulgation of the rules required under this subchapter, and to compel compliance by the department or the board of education with this subchapter and the rules promulgated pursuant thereto.

Declaration of legislative findings and intent. Childhood lead poisoning, the number one environmental health hazard facing children today, is caused by environmental exposure to lead.  The most significant sources of environmental lead are lead-based paint and dust and soil contaminated by lead-based paint.  Because lead-based paint was frequently utilized in the past to protect equipment exposed to the elements from corrosion, the paint on outdoor playground equipment is likely to have a much higher lead content than that found on interior building surfaces.\n \tInvestigations have disclosed high levels of lead in the soil of playgrounds as a result of the release of lead paint chips and dust from such playground equipment.  Small children may ingest lead by getting paint chips or dust on their hands and then putting their hands in their mouths, may mouth equipment or otherwise may inhale lead dust. \n \tThe United States consumer product safety commission (CPSC) has concluded that lead-painted public playground equipment with chipping and peeling lead paint is hazardous to children age six years and younger.  In coming to that conclusion, the CPSC tested paint from 26 playgrounds in 13 cities, and found that 16 playgrounds in 11 cities had levels of lead in the paint on playground equipment high enough to be recognized as a federal priority for lead hazard control measures.  In addition, while the CPSC concluded that playground equipment with intact lead paint is not a hazard, it noted that such paint will deteriorate from exposure to sunlight, heat, moisture and normal wear and tear to form chips and dust that would present a hazard.\n \tIn addition to CPSC's own findings, CPSC reported that paint on equipment in 223 playgrounds in 19 additional cities was tested for lead by state and local authorities or television stations doing news stories on lead hazards. Of those playgrounds, 125 of them in 11 cities were reported to have lead paint ranging from 0.09 percent to 29 percent lead by weight.  In February 1978 the CPSC banned the sale of public playground equipment with paint containing lead in excess of 0.06 percent by weight because it poses a risk of lead poisoning in children.\n \tThe council therefore declares that the failure to control lead-based paint hazards pursuant to this local law is a public nuisance and a condition dangerous to the life and health of children who are exposed on playgrounds to lead-based paint and soil contaminated by lead-based paint.\n \t(b) \t  For the purpose of this section, the following terms shall have the following meanings:\n \t(1) \t\"Lead-based paint\" shall mean any paint or other similar surface-coating material containing lead as defined in subdivision b of section 173.13 of the health code.\n \t(2) \t\"Public playground equipment\" shall mean any device, structure, or implement, fixed or portable, not including buildings, used or intended to be used by children under the age of six for recreational or athletic purposes, such as, but not limited to, swings, slides, sandboxes, see-saws, climbing bars, wading pools or obstacle courses located on any premises or grounds under the control of, or operated by or on behalf of, the board of education, the department of parks and recreation, or any private or public school or child day care facility.\n \tc.  \tEffective September 1, 2005, all public playground equipment with lead-based paint and paint of unknown lead content shall be replaced with playground equipment free of lead-based paint.  All paint or similar surface-coating material on any public playground equipment manufactured before March 1, 1978 shall be presumed to be lead-based paint.\n \td.  \tThere shall be no peeling or chipping lead-based paint on any portion of any public playground equipment or fencing.  Peeling lead-based paint and peeling paint of unknown lead content on public playground equipment shall be immediately abated in a manner required by the department.  Whenever a condition prohibited by this section is found to exist, the department shall immediately serve an order on the owner and operator of such public playground to abate the condition.  Nothing herein shall limit the department from issuing an order in any individual case requiring the abatement of any lead-based paint or paint of unknown lead content on any public playground equipment, whether peeling or not.\n \te.  \tThe department shall promulgate rules as may be necessary for the purpose of implementing the provisions of this section.  Such rules and regulations shall include the provision that (1) owners or operators of public playgrounds and playground equipment shall comply with safety and clean-up procedures to govern the abatement of lead-based paint pursuant to this section and such procedures shall ensure that children and adults are not exposed to lead-based paint or dust contaminated by lead-based paint through its release within or from a worksite, and (2) exposure to lead-based paint shall be minimized until a hazard is repaired.\n \tf.  \tNot later than fifteen months after the effective date of this section, and every six years thereafter, the department shall submit a report to the mayor and the council concerning the administration and enforcement of this section. \n    \n \t�10.\tThis local law shall take effect ninety days after its enactment, except that the department of health and the department of housing preservation and development shall promulgate rules and take all actions necessary to implement this local law on or before the date upon which it shall take effect.\n\n \t    \tRefeerred to the Committee on Environmental Protection.\n\n\nLS#4717 \nInt. 956",

The council\\ulnone  \\ul finds that lead poisoning from paint containing lead is a\\ulnone  \\ul preventable childhood disease and that the response to the public\\ulnone  \\ul health crisis caused by lead poisoning of children has remained\\ulnone  \\ul inadequate despite the enactment of local law number 1 for the\\ulnone  \\ul year 1982, which was intended to eliminate hazardous housing\\ulnone  \\ul conditions before a child becomes lead poisoned.  The council\\ulnone  \\ul further finds that the hazard in multiple dwellings that may occur\\ulnone  \\ul from paint containing lead is subject to many factors, such as the\\ulnone  \\ul age of a building and its maintenance.  The council therefore\\ulnone  \\ul recognizes that it cannot legislate a single maintenance standard\\ulnone  \\ul for all multiple dwellings to eliminate this hazard.  Instead, the\\ulnone  \\ul council by enacting this article makes it the duty of every owner\\ulnone  \\ul of a multiple dwelling to investigate dwelling units for\\ulnone  \\ul lead-based paint hazards and to address such hazards on a\\ulnone  \\ul case-by-case basis as the conditions may warrant, taking such\\ulnone  \\ul actions that are necessary to prevent a child from becoming lead\\ulnone  \\ul poisoned.  Having established this duty, the council finds that\\ulnone  \\ul sufficient information exists to guide owners in making\\ulnone  \\ul determinations about the existence of lead-based paint hazards. \\ulnone  \\ul See, e.g., United States environmental protection agency,\\ulnone  \\ul \"Guidance on Identification of Lead-Based Paint Hazards,\" Federal\\ulnone  \\ul Register, Vol. 60, No. 175 ( September 11, 1995); United States\\ulnone  \\ul department of housing and urban development, \"Guidelines for the\\ulnone  \\ul Evaluation and Control of Lead-Based Paint Hazards in Housing\"\\ulnone  \\ul (June 1995).\\ulnone\\par\n\\ul  \\ulnone\\tab\\ul The council further finds that in any dwelling unit where a\\ulnone  \\ul child under the age of six resides, or in the common areas of such\\ulnone  \\ul dwelling, the existence of lead-based paint constitutes an\\ulnone  \\ul immediately hazardous condition when it is peeling or located on a\\ulnone  \\ul deteriorated subsurface.  The council further finds that any\\ulnone  \\ul deficiency in the maintenance of a dwelling or dwelling unit that,\\ulnone  \\ul if uncorrected, may cause paint to peel or a painted subsurface to\\ulnone  \\ul deteriorate is also an immediately hazardous condition.\\ulnone\\par\n\\ul  \\ulnone\\tab\\ul In order that the department of housing preservation and\\ulnone  \\ul development may secure the appropriate correction of these\\ulnone  \\ul immediately hazardous conditions, this article makes the\\ulnone  \\ul conditions stated herein, or established by rules pursuant to this\\ulnone  \\ul article, a class C immediately hazardous violation under the code.\\ulnone  \\ul  The council declares that it is reasonable and necessary for the\\ulnone  \\ul department to diligently perform its duties so that the hazardous\\ulnone  \\ul conditions identified in this article shall be eradicated from all\\ulnone  \\ul applicable housing to the maximum extent possible.\\ulnone\\par\n\\ul  \\ulnone\\tab\\ul According to the federal centers for disease control and\\ulnone  \\ul prevention, a child whose blood-lead level is equal to or exceeds\\ulnone  \\ul 20 micrograms per deciliter is seriously lead poisoned, requiring\\ulnone  \\ul immediate hospitalization or clinical evaluation and treatment. \\ulnone  \\ul In fiscal year 1996, the New York city department of health\\ulnone  \\ul identified 1,621 children whose blood-lead level was equal to or\\ulnone  \\ul exceeded 20 micrograms per deciliter and the department projected\\ulnone  \\ul it would identify 2,370 more cases in fiscal year 1997.  In every\\ulnone  \\ul case of a lead poisoned child at this blood-lead level, the city\\ulnone  \\ul is required under its health code to conduct an environmental\\ulnone  \\ul investigation for the source of a child s lead poisoning.  The\\ulnone  \\ul city must incur the expense of this investigation as well as other\\ulnone  \\ul costs, including a child s medical treatment and remedial\\ulnone  \\ul education.  In addition, the New York state department of health\\ulnone  \\ul has reported a blood-lead testing rate for children residing in\\ulnone  \\ul the city of New York of only 63%, even though the testing of all\\ulnone  \\ul children under the age of six is mandatory under state law.  The\\ulnone  \\ul council finds this high incidence of lead poisoning and low rate\\ulnone  \\ul of blood-lead testing to constitute a public health crisis.\\ulnone\\par\n\\ul  \\ulnone\\tab\\ul The council declares that it is reasonable and necessary to\\ulnone  \\ul increase the rate of blood-lead testing in fiscal years 2000 and\\ulnone  \\ul 2002 to 75% and 90%, respectively, and to reduce the number of\\ulnone  \\ul children who become lead poisoned to less than 1,000 and 750,\\ulnone  \\ul respectively.  In the event that any of these goals are not\\ulnone  \\ul achieved, this local law requires the department of health to make\\ulnone  \\ul recommendations to the council to amend the law as necessary to\\ulnone  \\ul achieve such goal.\\ulnone\\par\n\\ul  \\ulnone\\tab\\ul The council further finds that the administration and\\ulnone  \\ul enforcement of local law number 1 for the year 1982 is\\ulnone  \\ul unnecessarily divided among several agencies of the city, causing\\ulnone  \\ul confusion and inefficiency.  While it is intended that the\\ulnone  \\ul department of housing preservation and development remain the\\ulnone  \\ul agency responsible for the implementation and enforcement of this\\ulnone  \\ul article, it is also intended that the department of health shall\\ulnone  \\ul have the primary responsibility for promulgating and interpreting\\ulnone  \\ul  rules, regulations, and procedures as well as  monitoring\\ulnone  \\ul pursuant to this article.\\ulnone\\par\n\\ul  \\ulnone\\tab\\ul\\'a727-2056.2 Definitions.

Declaration of legislative findings and intent. Childhood lead\\ulnone  \\ul poisoning, the number one environmental health hazard facing\\ulnone  \\ul children today, is caused by environmental exposure to lead.  The\\ulnone  \\ul most significant sources of environmental lead are lead-based\\ulnone  \\ul paint and dust and soil contaminated by lead-based paint.  Because\\ulnone  \\ul lead-based paint was frequently utilized in the past to protect\\ulnone  \\ul equipment exposed to the elements from corrosion, the paint on\\ulnone  \\ul outdoor playground equipment is likely to have a much higher lead\\ulnone  \\ul content than that found on interior building surfaces.\\ulnone\\par\n\\ul  \\ulnone\\tab\\ul Investigations have disclosed high levels of lead in the soil of\\ulnone  \\ul playgrounds as a result of the release of lead paint chips and\\ulnone  \\ul dust from such playground equipment.  Small children may ingest\\ulnone  \\ul lead by getting paint chips or dust on their hands and then\\ulnone  \\ul putting their hands in their mouths, may mouth equipment or\\ulnone  \\ul otherwise may inhale lead dust. \\ulnone\\par\n\\ul  \\ulnone\\tab\\ul The United States consumer product safety commission (CPSC) has\\ulnone  \\ul concluded that lead-painted public playground equipment with\\ulnone  \\ul chipping and peeling lead paint is hazardous to children age six\\ulnone  \\ul years and younger.  In coming to that conclusion, the CPSC tested\\ulnone  \\ul paint from 26 playgrounds in 13 cities, and found that 16\\ulnone  \\ul playgrounds in 11 cities had levels of lead in the paint on\\ulnone  \\ul playground equipment high enough to be recognized as a federal\\ulnone  \\ul priority for lead hazard control measures.  In addition, while the\\ulnone  \\ul CPSC concluded that playground equipment with intact lead paint is\\ulnone  \\ul not a hazard, it noted that such paint will deteriorate from\\ulnone  \\ul exposure to sunlight, heat, moisture and normal wear and tear to\\ulnone  \\ul form chips and dust that would present a hazard.\\ulnone\\par\n\\ul  \\ulnone\\tab\\ul In addition to CPSC's own findings, CPSC reported that paint on\\ulnone  \\ul equipment in 223 playgrounds in 19 additional cities was tested\\ulnone  \\ul for lead by state and local authorities or television stations\\ulnone  \\ul doing news stories on lead hazards. Of those playgrounds, 125 of\\ulnone  \\ul them in 11 cities were reported to have lead paint ranging from\\ulnone  \\ul 0.09 percent to 29 percent lead by weight.  In February 1978 the\\ulnone  \\ul CPSC banned the sale of public playground equipment with paint\\ulnone  \\ul containing lead in excess of 0.06 percent by weight because it\\ulnone  \\ul poses a risk of lead poisoning in children.\\ulnone\\par\n\\ul  \\ulnone\\tab\\ul The council therefore declares that the failure to control\\ulnone  \\ul lead-based paint hazards pursuant to this local law is a public\\ulnone  \\ul nuisance and a condition dangerous to the life and health of\\ulnone  \\ul children who are exposed on playgrounds to lead-based paint and\\ulnone  \\ul soil contaminated by lead-based paint.\\ulnone\\par\n\\ul  \\ulnone\\tab\\ul (b) \\ulnone\\tab\\ul   For the purpose of this section, the following terms\\ulnone  \\ul shall have the following meanings:\\ulnone\\par\n\\ul  \\ulnone\\tab\\ul (1) \\ulnone\\tab\\ul \"Lead-based paint\" shall mean any paint or other similar\\ulnone  \\ul surface-coating material containing lead as defined in subdivision\\ulnone  \\ul b of section 173.13 of the health code.\\ulnone\\par\n\\ul  \\ulnone\\tab\\ul (2) \\ulnone\\tab\\ul \"Public playground equipment\" shall mean any device,\\ulnone  \\ul structure, or implement, fixed or portable, not including\\ulnone  \\ul buildings, used or intended to be used by children under the age\\ulnone  \\ul of six for recreational or athletic purposes, such as, but not\\ulnone  \\ul limited to, swings, slides, sandboxes, see-saws, climbing bars,\\ulnone  \\ul wading pools or obstacle courses located on any premises or\\ulnone  \\ul grounds under the control of, or operated by or on behalf of, the\\ulnone  \\ul board of education, the department of parks and recreation, or any\\ulnone  \\ul private or public school or child day care facility.\\ulnone\\par\n\\ul  \\ulnone\\tab\\ul c.  \\ulnone\\tab\\ul Effective September 1, 2005, all public playground\\ulnone  \\ul equipment with lead-based paint and paint of unknown lead content\\ulnone  \\ul shall be replaced with playground equipment free of lead-based\\ulnone  \\ul paint.
