  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n     \tSection 1. Legislative intent. The Council of the City of New York finds that the current method of awarding property tax exemptions to promote development achieves inconsistent and unreliable results.  The Council further finds that different commercial or industrial projects are likely to have different employment and income impacts under different market conditions. Consequently, in awarding subsidies based on property investment, there is no guarantee that  local job or income creation will result, especially during current exemption periods as long as twenty-two years.  Therefore, the Council finds that the current method of awarding property tax exemptions constitutes an excessively costly, risky and speculative approach to promoting job and income growth in the city.\n     \tTo address this problem, the Council finds it appropriate to enact reforms that would directly link and continually adjust the amount of incentives provided by the city to the number of new jobs a firm generates.  Therefore, the Council finds it appropriate to enact legislation to change the basis of incentive awards from property investment to new job creation in the city.\n     \t�2. Chapter 2 of title 11 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding thereto a new part 5, to follow part 4, to read as follows:\n\nPart 5\nTax Credit for Private Sector Job Creation\n     \t�11-268.
