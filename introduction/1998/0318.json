This local law shall be effective immediately and shall be deemed in full force and effect on September 6, 1995; provided, however, that section 21-125 of the administrative code of the city of New York as added by section three of this local law and the department of homeless services as established by chapter 24-A of the New York city charter and chapter 3 of title 21 of the administrative code of the city of New York as amended by sections one and two of this local law shall expire on [July 1, 1998] December 31, 1998 and the functions, powers and duties of the department of homeless services set forth in chapter 24-A of the New York city charter and chapter 3 of title 21 of  the administrative code of the city of New York as amended by sections one and two of this local law, including section 21-309 prohibiting referrals to non-compliant hotel units, shall devolve upon the department of social services; provided, however, that if the commissioner of the department of homeless services fails to eliminate the use of all non-compliant hotel units for the purposes of housing homeless families with children by September 30, 1996, then section 21-125 of the administrative code of the city of New York as added by section 3 of this local law and the department of homeless services as established by chapter 24-A of the New York city charter and chapter 3 of title 21 of the administrative code of the city of New York as amended by sections one and two of this local law shall expire on October 1, 1996 and the functions, powers and duties of the department of homeless services set forth in chapter 24-A of the New York city charter and chapter three of title 21 of the administrative code of the city of New York as amended by sections one and two of this local law, including section 21-309 prohibiting referrals to non-compliant hotel units, shall devolve upon the department of social services.  Notwithstanding the foregoing requirement to eliminate the use of all non-compliant hotel units for the purposes of housing homeless families with children by September 30, 1996, if such use is necessary to comply with a court order as authorized pursuant to section 21-309 of the administrative code of the city of New York as added by this local law, then section 21-125 of the administrative code of the city of New York as added by section three of this local law and the department of homeless services as established by chapter 24-A of the New York city charter and chapter 3 of title 21 of the administrative code of the city of New York as amended by sections one and two of this local law shall not expire on October 1, 1996.\n\t�2. Nothing contained in this local law shall affect or impair the rights or privileges of officers or employees of the city or of any agency existing at the time when this local law takes effect, or any provision of law in force at the time when this local law takes effect and not inconsistent with the provisions of this local law, in relation to the personnel, appointment, ranks, grades, tenure of office, promotion, removal, pension and retirement rights, civil rights or any other rights or privileges of officers or employees of the city generally or officers or employees of any agency.\n\t�3. Officers and employees in the classified municipal services who are transferred to the department of homeless services pursuant to local law 51 for the year 1993 shall be transferred without examination and without affecting existing compensation or pension or retirement rights, or other privileges or obligations of such officers and employees. \n\t�4. It is the intent of this local law to protect those rights enumerated in sections two and three as they apply to officers and employees of the classified municipal services of the department of homeless services who were transferred to the department of homeless services during the initial staffing period, as defined in an addendum to the memorandum of agreement dated June 15, 1994 between the city of New York and district council 37, AFSCME, AFL-CIO. Such employees shall have the right to exercise contractual transfer procedures; the right in case of layoff from the department of homeless services to be returned to the human resources administration without loss in benefits; the right in case of the restructuring or abolition of the department of homeless services to be returned to the human resources administration without loss in benefits; and the right that service in either the human resources administration or the department of homeless services shall be deemed as service in the other agency.\n\t�5. This local law shall take effect immediately, except that, if this local law is enacted subsequent to June 30, 1998 it shall be deemed to have been in full force and effect on such date.\n\t\n\t\n\t5/18/98\n\tsl: extender",
