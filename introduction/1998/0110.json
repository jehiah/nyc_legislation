  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n      Section 1. Legislative Findings and Intent. As an integral part of New York s rich economic history, street vending continues to provide a desirable economic opportunity for many New Yorkers.  It also, however, competes with many other important uses for limited sidewalk space, creating a pervasive public safety hazard.  Accordingly, careful placement and regulation of street vendors is essential to maintaining public safety and promoting a time-honored business.\n      \n      The inadequacies of the current regulatory system, compounded by conflicting case law, have led to confusing and convoluted regulations lacking any comprehensive placement mechanism for street vendors.  As a result, street vendors are left without any clear and concise direction as to where, when and how to operate.  Moreover, the complexities and inconsistencies of the current system diminish the ability to effectively enforce the laws and ensure public safety.  This problem has, in recent years, spread beyond the midtown Manhattan core and has adversely affected commercial areas citywide.\n      Consistent with recent court rulings, the following local law will systematically place street vendors in logical and reasonable locations which will provide them with access to their customers while maintaining the free flow of  pedestrian traffic and, thereby, promoting public safety.  The local law will create a user-friendly \"warrant system\" which will identify both vendor and location, thus assuring proper compliance by the single vendor allowable per intersection.  Moreover, vendors will have increased opportunities to do business because the local law codifies additional vending locations in the five boroughs. The council does not intend to establish by action of this local law any property right to a particular location. \n      The local law promotes freedom of expression by allowing vendors of first amendment protected material to vend without a license and anywhere they wish, so long as they are vending from their person.  If they wish to use a free standing display, they will participate in the warrant system described above.\n      Finally, the local law eases the administrative burden of vendor licensing and regulation by consolidating the process under one agency with the appropriate enforcement power.  Most importantly, the local law ensures fairness in both the license issuance and placement processes.  In sum, this local law will consolidate, simplify and standardize the entire process for the regulation of vendors for the benefit of both the vendor and the public.\n      �2. Subchapter 27 of chapter 2 of title 20 of the administrative code of the city of New York is REPEALED.\n      �3. Subchapter 2 of chapter 3 of title 17 of the administrative code of the city of New York is REPEALED.\n      �4.

Legislative Findings and Intent. As an integral part of New York s rich economic history, street vending continues to provide a desirable economic opportunity for many New Yorkers.  It also, however, competes with many other important uses for limited sidewalk space, creating a pervasive public safety hazard.  Accordingly, careful placement and regulation of street vendors is essential to maintaining public safety and promoting a time-honored business.\\par\nThe inadequacies of the current regulatory system, compounded by conflicting case law, have led to confusing and convoluted regulations lacking any comprehensive placement mechanism for street vendors.  As a result, street vendors are left without any clear and concise direction as to where, when and how to operate.  Moreover, the complexities and inconsistencies of the current system diminish the ability to effectively enforce the laws and ensure public safety.  This problem has, in recent years, spread beyond the midtown Manhattan core and has adversely affected commercial areas citywide.\\par\nConsistent with recent court rulings, the following local law will systematically place street vendors in logical and reasonable locations which will provide them with access to their customers while maintaining the free flow of  pedestrian traffic and, thereby, promoting public safety.  The local law will create a user-friendly \"warrant system\" which will identify both vendor and location, thus assuring proper compliance by the single vendor allowable per intersection.  Moreover, vendors will have increased opportunities to do business because the local law codifies additional vending locations in the five boroughs. The council does not intend to establish by action of this local law any property right to a particular location. \\par\nThe local law promotes freedom of expression by allowing vendors of first amendment protected material to vend without a license and anywhere they wish, so long as they are vending from their person.  If they wish to use a free standing display, they will participate in the warrant system described above.\\par\n\\pard\\ltrpar\\nowidctlpar\\fi720\\sl480\\slmult1\\qj\\tx720\\tx1440\\tx2160\\tx2880\\tx3600\\tx4320\\tx5040\\tx5760\\tx6480\\tx7344\\tx8064\\tx8784 Finally, the local law eases the administrative burden of vendor licensing and regulation by consolidating the process under one agency with the appropriate enforcement power.  Most importantly, the local law ensures fairness in both the license issuance and placement processes.  In sum, this local law will consolidate, simplify and standardize the entire process for the regulation of vendors for the benefit of both the vendor and the public.\\par\n\\'a72.
