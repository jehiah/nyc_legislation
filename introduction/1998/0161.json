Section 19-162 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\n     \tï¿½19-162 Permissible parking for certain purposes. 1. Notwithstanding any local law or regulation to the contrary, but subject to the provisions of the vehicle and traffic law, it shall be permissible for a bus owned, used or hired by public or nonpublic schools to park at any time, including overnight, upon any street or roadway, provided said bus occupies a parking spot in front of and within the building lines of the premises of the said public school or nonpublic school.\n\t2. Notwithstanding any local law, rule or regulation to the contrary, it shall be permissible for a faculty member of a public school to park a motor vehicle other than a bus or, a commercial vehicle, on any street adjacent to the public school to which such faculty member is assigned during the days and hours that such public school is in session, provided, however, that such faculty member shall prominently display in the front window of the motor vehicle an authorized, valid parking permit. In order to implement the provisions of this paragraph, the department shall post official signs indicating that faculty parking shall be permissible during school hours along the perimeter of all public schools.\n\t[2.] 3. Notwithstanding the department of transportation regulation prohibiting parking in front of private driveways, it shall be permissible for the owner or lessor of the lot accessed by such driveway to park a passenger vehicle registered to him or her at that address in front of such driveway, provided that such lot does not contain more that two dwelling units and, further provided that such parking does not violate any other provision of the vehicle and traffic law or local law, rule or regulation concerning the parking, stopping or standing of motor vehicles. The hearing officer shall dismiss any notice of violation issued to the owner of such passenger vehicle upon receipt from the owner, in person or by mail, of a copy of the vehicle registration containing the same address as that at which the ticket was given or other suitable evidence showing compliance with the law. The director of the bureau shall set forth the proof required in the case of lots where confusion may arise including, but not limited to, corner lots or lots with dual addresses.\n\n     \tReferred to the Committee on Transportation.\nLS #2873\n07/15/96\nJJ:ts\nInt. 829\n\n\n\n                           --",
