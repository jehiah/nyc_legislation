  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      Section 1.  Declaration of Legislative Findings and Intent.  The Council finds that certain recipients of public subsidies under the Family Assistance and Safety Net Assistance programs assigned by the city of New York to its Work Experience Program (\"WEP\") are required to work a specified number of hours each week in order to maintain their eligibility for continued public assistance.  The Council further finds that WEP participants have not consistently been provided with appropriate terms and conditions of work.  For example, participants have not consistently been provided with proper equipment and appropriate gear, such as, but not limited to:  gloves, safety goggles, and proper clothing to protect them from the elements.  In addition, participants have not consistently been given the opportunity to informally resolve disputes with the sponsoring agency prior to the reporting of alleged failure or refusal to comply with program requirements to the local social services district.  The Council therefore believes that a grievance procedure must be codified to ensure that WEP participants are permitted to address grievances that may arise out of their work assignments and to provide the opportunity to have these grievances resolved within the sponsoring agency in an expeditious and just manner.\n      The Council finds that the conciliation provision of New York State Social Services Law and its implementing regulations do not address efforts by participants and sponsoring agencies to resolve disputes at the level of the sponsoring agency prior to involvement of the social services district.  The Council further finds that the State Social Services Law expresses no need for state-wide uniformity in the administration of local Public Assistance Employment Programs.  Rather, by omitting direct regulation of local sponsoring agencies, the State Legislature recognized the strong local interest in designing alternatives not specifically provided by state law, in order to meet the needs of the local community.  The purpose of this local law is therefore to meet the legitimate local interest of the city of New York in providing a mechanism for its residents who are participants in WEP to informally resolve disputes that may arise with local sponsoring agencies, prior to the involvement of the local social services district. \n      \n      The Council recognizes that, pursuant to New York State Social Services Law �341, the New York City Human Resources Administration (\"HRA\") has established a conciliation procedure for individuals who are alleged to have violated work activities requirements and a procedure to resolve other disputes related to participation in work activities.  However, the Council finds that the state-mandated procedure for individuals who are alleged to have violated work activities requirements does not provide a means for participants and sponsoring agencies to resolve such disputes at the level of the sponsoring agency prior to involvement of the social services district.  The Council further finds that the HRA procedure to resolve disputes related to participation in work activities, to the extent it provides for sponsoring agency participation, is not enforceable by participants, and was not established pursuant to any powers or duties assigned or delegated to the HRA by the State of New York.  Thus, the grievance procedure established by this local law neither overlaps with nor directly affects the procedures established by HRA pursuant to New York State law and regulations. \n      For all the foregoing reasons, the Council finds that the grievance procedure established by this local law is well within the powers of the Council under New York State Municipal Home Rule Law and the Charter of the City of New York.\n      2. Title 21 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to add a new chapter 5 to read as follows:\n\tChapter 5\nWork Experience Program Grievance Procedure\n\t�21-501 Definitions.  As used in this chapter:\na.\t\"Participant\" means an applicant for or recipient of  family assistance or safety net assistance who volunteers for or who has been required to participate in the work experience program.\n\nb.\t\" Sponsoring agency\" means a public agency or a private non-profit or for-profit organization providing an employment related activity(ies) or service(s) to a social services district or the department of social services through contract or agreement.\nc.\t\"Terms and conditions of work\" shall encompass hours of work, transportation, training, health, safety, alleged failure to comply with program or work activities requirements, and any and all other terms and conditions of work for participants.\nd.\t\"Grievance\" means:\ni.\ta dispute between a sponsoring agency and one or more WEP participants concerning any terms and conditions of work; or\nii.\ta claimed violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of the rules or regulations of a sponsoring agency affecting the terms and conditions of work.\ne.\t\"Work Experience Program\" or \"WEP\" shall mean the program established by New York City pursuant to and governed by Title 9-B of the New York State social services law section 336-c and implementing regulations, under which individuals receiving family assistance or safety net assistance who are assigned to the work experience program are required to work for a specified number of hours per week in a government or private not-for-profit or for-profit agency in order to maintain their eligibility for continued public assistance.\nf.   \"Step 1 supervisor\" means the participants immediate supervisor, unless the\nparticipant's immediate supervisor is represented for purposes of collective bargaining, in which case the sponsoring agency shall designate a supervisor who is not represented for purposes of collective bargaining to hear and resolve Step 1 grievances. \n\t�21-502 Applicability.  This chapter shall apply to all sponsoring agencies and WEP participants. \n\t�21-503 Grievance Procedure.\n\na.\tThe following procedure shall be established in order to allow for the timely resolution of grievances.

The Council further finds that WEP participants have not consistently been provided with appropriate terms and conditions of work.  For example, participants have not consistently been provided with proper equipment and appropriate gear, such as, but not limited to:  gloves, safety goggles, and proper clothing to protect them from the elements.  In addition, participants have not consistently been given the opportunity to informally resolve disputes with the sponsoring agency prior to the reporting of alleged failure or refusal to comply with program requirements to the local social services district.  The Council therefore believes that a grievance procedure must be codified to ensure that WEP participants are permitted to address grievances that may arise out of their work assignments and to provide the opportunity to have these grievances resolved within the sponsoring agency in an expeditious and just manner.\\par\nThe Council finds that the conciliation provision of New York State Social Services Law and its implementing regulations do not address efforts by participants and sponsoring agencies to resolve disputes at the level of the sponsoring agency prior to involvement of the social services district.  The Council further finds that the State Social Services Law expresses no need for state-wide uniformity in the administration of local Public Assistance Employment Programs.  Rather, by omitting direct regulation of local sponsoring agencies, the State Legislature recognized the strong local interest in designing alternatives not specifically provided by state law, in order to meet the needs of the local community.  The purpose of this local law is therefore to meet the legitimate local interest of the city of New York in providing a mechanism for its residents who are participants in WEP to informally resolve disputes that may arise with local sponsoring agencies, prior to the involvement of the local social services district. \\par\nThe Council recognizes that, pursuant to New York State Social Services Law \\expndtw-3\\f1\\fs24\\'a7\\expndtw0\\f0\\fs26 341, the New York City Human Resources Administration (\\rdblquote HRA\\rdblquote ) has established a conciliation procedure for individuals who are alleged to have violated work activities requirements and a procedure to resolve other disputes related to participation in work activities.  However, the Council finds that the state-mandated procedure for individuals who are alleged to have violated work activities requirements does not provide a means for participants and sponsoring agencies to resolve such disputes at the level of the sponsoring agency prior to involvement of the social services district.  The Council further finds that the HRA procedure to resolve disputes related to participation in work activities, to the extent it provides for sponsoring agency participation, is not enforceable by participants, and was not established pursuant to any powers or duties assigned or delegated to the HRA by the State of New York.  Thus, the grievance procedure established by this local law neither overlaps with nor directly affects the procedures established by HRA pursuant to New York State law and regulations. \\par\nFor all the foregoing reasons, the Council finds that the grievance procedure established by this local law is well within the powers of the Council under New York State Municipal Home Rule Law and the Charter of the City of New York.\\par\n2. Title 21 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to add a new chapter 5 to read as follows:\\par\n\\pard\\ltrpar\\sl480\\slmult1\\qj\\tqc\\tx4500\\tx5040\\tx5760\\tx6480\\tx7200\\tx7920\\tx8640\\tab\\ul Chapter 5\\ulnone\\par\n\\pard\\ltrpar\\keepn\\s1\\sl480\\slmult1\\qj\\tx0\\tx720\\tx1260\\tx1800\\tx2880\\tx3600\\tx4320\\tx5040\\tx5760\\tx6480\\tx7200\\tx7920\\tx8640\\ul Work Experience Program Grievance Procedure\\b\\par\n\\pard\\ltrpar\\sl480\\slmult1\\qj\\tx0\\tx720\\tx1260\\tx1800\\tx2880\\tx3600\\tx4320\\tx5040\\tx5760\\tx6480\\tx7200\\tx7920\\tx8640\\expndtw-3\\ulnone\\b0\\f1\\fs24\\tab\\'a7\\expndtw0\\ul\\b\\f0\\fs26 21-501 Definitions.\\b0   As used in this chapter\\ulnone :\\par\n\\pard\\ltrpar\\fi-720\\li720\\sl480\\slmult1\\qj\\tx0\\tx720\\tx1260\\tx1800\\tx2880\\tx3600\\tx4320\\tx5040\\tx5760\\tx6480\\tx7200\\tx7920\\tx8640\\ul a.\\ulnone\\tab\\ul \"Participant\" means an applicant for or recipient of  family assistance or safety net assistance who volunteers for or who has been required to participate in the work experience program\\ulnone .\\par\n\\ul b.\\ulnone\\tab\\ul \" Sponsoring agency\" means a public agency or a private non-profit or for-profit\\ulnone  \\ul organization providing an employment related activity(ies) or service(s) to a social services district or the department of social services through contract or agreement\\ulnone .\\par\n\\ul c.\\ulnone\\tab\\ul \"Terms and conditions of work\" shall encompass hours of work, transportation, training, health, safety, alleged failure to comply with program or work activities requirements, and any and all other terms and conditions of work for participants\\ulnone .\\par\n\\pard\\ltrpar\\sl480\\slmult1\\qj\\tx0\\tx720\\tx1260\\tx1800\\tx2880\\tx3600\\tx4320\\tx5040\\tx5760\\tx6480\\tx7200\\tx7920\\tx8640\\ul d.\\ulnone\\tab\\ul \"Grievance\" means\\ulnone :\\par\n\\pard\\ltrpar\\fi-540\\li1260\\sl480\\slmult1\\qj\\tx0\\tx720\\tx1260\\tx1800\\tx2880\\tx3600\\tx4320\\tx5040\\tx5760\\tx6480\\tx7200\\tx7920\\tx8640\\ul i.\\ulnone\\tab\\ul a dispute between a sponsoring agency and one or more WEP\\ulnone  \\ul participants concerning any terms and conditions of work; or\\ulnone\\par\n\\ul ii.\\ulnone\\tab\\ul a claimed violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of the rules or\\ulnone  \\ul regulations of a sponsoring agency affecting the terms and conditions of work\\ulnone .\\par\n\\pard{\\pntext\\f0 f.\\tab}{\\*\\pn\\pnlvlbody\\pnf0\\pnindent360\\pnstart6\\pnlcltr{\\pntxta.}}\n\\ltrpar\\fi-540\\li540\\sl480\\slmult1\\qj\\tx0\\tx540\\tx1260\\tx1800\\tx2880\\tx3600\\tx4320\\tx5040\\tx5760\\tx6480\\tx7200\\tx7920\\tx8640\\ul e.\\ulnone\\tab\\ul \"Work Experience Program\" or \"WEP\" shall mean the program established by New York City pursuant to and governed by Title 9-B of the New York State social services law section 336-c and implementing regulations, under which individuals receiving family assistance or safety net assistance who are assigned to the work experience program are required to work for a specified number of hours per week in a government or private not-for-profit or for-profit agency in order to maintain their eligibility for continued public assistance.\\ulnone   \\ul\\ldblquote Step 1 supervisor\\rdblquote  means the participants immediate supervisor, unless the\\par\n\\pard\\ltrpar\\li720\\sl480\\slmult1\\qj\\tx0\\tx1260\\tx1800\\tx2880\\tx3600\\tx4320\\tx5040\\tx5760\\tx6480\\tx7200\\tx7920\\tx8640 participant\\rquote s immediate supervisor is represented for purposes of collective bargaining, in which case the sponsoring agency shall designate a supervisor who is not represented for purposes of collective bargaining to hear and resolve Step 1 grievances\\ulnone .\\expndtw-3\\f1\\fs24  \\par\n\\pard\\ltrpar\\sl480\\slmult1\\qj\\tx0\\tx720\\tx1260\\tx1800\\tx2880\\tx3600\\tx4320\\tx5040\\tx5760\\tx6480\\tx7200\\tx7920\\tx8640\\tab\\'a7\\expndtw0\\ul\\b\\f0\\fs26 21-502 Applicability.\\b0   This chapter shall apply to all sponsoring agencies and WEP participants\\ulnone .\\expndtw-3\\f1\\fs24  \\par\n\\tab\\'a7\\expndtw0\\ul\\b\\f0\\fs26 21-503 Grievance Procedure\\ulnone .\\b0\\par\n\\pard\\ltrpar\\fi-720\\li720\\sl480\\slmult1\\qj\\tx0\\tx720\\tx1260\\tx1800\\tx2880\\tx3600\\tx4320\\tx5040\\tx5760\\tx6480\\tx7200\\tx7920\\tx8640\\ul a.\\ulnone\\tab\\ul The following procedure shall be established in order to allow for the timely resolution of grievances.
