Such panel shall also include a member appointed by the mayor upon nomination by the speaker of the council.  The commissioner of the department of business services or his or her designee shall serve as the chairperson.  The departments of business services, city planning and transportation shall provide such assistance as the street vendor review panel deems necessary and appropriate to enable such panel to carry out its responsibilities.] In the same manner as provided in section 1043 of the city charter, the [street vendor review panel] department of transportation shall promulgate, and may from time to time amend, rules prohibiting the operation of any general vending business or food vending business, as defined in chapter three of title seventeen of this code, or both, on any street, at any time, after making a determination that such vending business would constitute a serious and immediate threat to the health, safety and well-being of the public on the ground that such street at such time is regularly too congested by pedestrian or vehicular traffic to permit the operation of such business.  The determination of whether a street is regularly too congested by pedestrian or vehicular traffic to permit the operation of such business shall be based solely on specific objective and quantitative criteria that the Department of Transportation shall adopt pursuant to section 1043 of the city charter within 120 days of enactment of this local law.  If the Department makes such a determination,  [No] no general vendor, or food vendor as defined in chapter three of title seventeen of this code, shall vend on any such streets at any such times.\n    \tb.  \tRequests for the adoption or amendment of rules prohibiting the operation of any general vending business or food vending business, as defined in chapter three of title seventeen of this code, or both, on any street, at any time, may be submitted to the commissioner of the department of [business services] transportation [or his or her designee].

In making such a recommendation, such commissioner [or his or her designee] shall consider (a) whether such obstructions are intrinsic to the operation of businesses within such areas and such businesses constitute an essential part of the unique historical and commercial nature of such area and (b) the measures which shall be taken to ameliorate the danger to the public health, safety and welfare in such areas which may be caused  in whole or in part, by the maintenance of such obstructions. [Such] The commissioner may from time to time review, modify or revoke such recommendations. A recommendation by the commissioner [or his or her designee] pursuant to this paragraph shall be effective upon the report of such recommendation to the council and the approval of such recommendation by the council pursuant to local law.  Notice of any recommendation made by the commissioner [or his or her designee] shall be published in the City Record and mailed to each community board not less than thirty days prior to such commissioner's report to the council.   \n    \t�3. \tThe opening paragraph of paragraph four of subdivision c of section 19-136 of the administrative code of the city of New York, is amended to read as follows:\n    \t4.  \tOn the following streets where general vending has been prohibited by the [street vendor review panel] commissioner of the department of transportation pursuant to section 20-465.1 of this code and any rules promulgated thereunder, the provisions of paragraph one of this subdivision shall not apply:\n    \t�4. \tSubdivision g of section 20-465 of the administrative code of the city of New York, is amended to read as follows:\n    \tg.  \tNo general vendor shall vend on any street which is in a C4, C5, or C6 zoning district, or in the area bounded on the east by Second Avenue, on the south by Thirtieth Street, on the west by Ninth Avenue and Columbus Avenue and on the north by Sixty-fifth Street, except that [as chairperson of the street vendor review panel established] pursuant to section 20-465.1 of this subchapter, the commissioner of the department of [business services] transportation [or his or her designee] may receive applications from any person, group, organization or other entity to permit general vendors on any street within said area or said zones, or to prohibit general vendors on any other street.
