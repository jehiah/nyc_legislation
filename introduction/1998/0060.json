The children's defense and development fund.  a. The mayor shall direct the comptroller to establish and maintain a fund, separate and apart from the general fund, for a period of ten fiscal years following the effective date of the local law that added this section to expand children's services, which shall be called the \"children's defense and development fund\" (hereinafter \"the fund\"). Monies shall be set aside for the fund from the revenue of the tax levy on real property in the city of New York, in an amount equal to three-fourths of one cent of each one dollar ($1.00) of real property taxes collected for the first fiscal year; revenues in an amount equal to one and one half cents for each one dollar ($1.00) of real property taxes collected in the second fiscal year; revenues in an amount equal to three and one-eighth cents for each one dollar ($1.00) of real property taxes collected in the third fiscal year, and revenues in an amount equal to six and one quarter cents for each one dollar ($1.00) of real property taxes collected for each of the remaining fiscal year of the fund.  The fund shall be used exclusively to supplement, and not to supplant, funds for services already provided for children and educational services to children less than twenty-one years of age. The fund shall not be used for services that only benefit children incidentally, or as members of a larger population of children and adults, nor shall it be used for functions and services provided by the judiciary, the department of correction, police department or other law enforcement agencies, such as youth detention and probation services.\n     \tb. During the term of the fund the spending for children's services shall not be reduced below the higher of the fiscal year 1993 or fiscal year 1994 levels of spending for such services.\n     \tc. During each fiscal year in which the fund shall be in effect, a minimum of forty percent (40%) of the money deposited into the fund shall be expended to plan and implement a phased-in reduction of class size in public schools until the following teacher-student ratios are achieved in every subject class: primary grades, one classroom teacher to every fifteen to twenty students; secondary grades, one classroom teacher to every twenty to twenty-four students.  No funds transferred to the board of education pursuant to this subdivision may be used for purposes other than class size reduction. Any funds not used for that purpose, or any funds the board of education refuses to accept, shall be used by the fund for other purposes in accordance with the annual plan.\n     \td. During the first four years of the fund, a minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the money deposited into the fund shall be used for day care; a minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the money deposited into the fund shall be used for health and social services, including child protective services; a minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the money deposited into the fund shall be used for youth employment and training and youth development and diversion programs and opportunities for entrepreneur training programs, including but not limited to recreation, performing arts, and visual arts (to the extent possible these services shall be provided by not-for-profit community-based service providers); a minimum of five percent (5%) of the money deposited into the fund shall be used to increase and improve support services to public school students, including but not limited guidance counselors, paraprofessionals and family paraprofessionals; and a minimum of four percent (4%) of the money deposited into the fund shall be used for community service programs for college students domiciled in New York city.  Community service programs shall be defined as programs that provide experimental internships in the areas of education, public health, environmental rededication, public works and mentoring of children and adolescents.\n     \te. The mayor shall prepare and present to the speaker of the city council a children's services plan pursuant to section 103 of this charter; such children's services plan shall propose goals and objectives for the fund for the fiscal year immediately following the effective date of the local law that added this section.\n     \t     \t�3023. Duties and powers of the children's service planning commission. a. There shall be a children's service planning commission that shall annually prepare, submit and propose to the mayor, city council, each borough president and the board of education, a children's service plan in time to be reviewed, evaluated, adopted and revised by the mayor, and included in the preliminary expense budget, executive expense budget and financial plan submitted pursuant to chapter six of this charter.

The commission may request and shall receive from such city agencies which provide services to children, such information, other than information required by law to be kept confidential or which is privileged as attorney-client communications, attorney work products or material prepared for litigation, and such assistance as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter.\n     \t�2. Section one hundred and three of the New York city charter  is\nhereby amended by adding a new paragraph (h) to read as follows: \t\n\t(h) \tthe children's services plan pursuant to chapter seventy-five of the charter.\n     \t�3.
