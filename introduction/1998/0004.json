The board shall complete its investigation within 10 days of receipt of the allegations.  During that period, the non-participating candidate shall have the opportunity to appear before the board and/or file with the board any written response to the allegations and any supporting documents.\n\tIf upon review of the documents and the completion of its own investigation, the board finds that there is clear and convincing evidence of overspending by the non-participating candidate, the board shall issue a written decision to that effect before granting the requisite matching funds to the participating candidate.
