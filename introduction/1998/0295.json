The commissioner shall deposit all moneys which shall come into the commissioner's  hands on account of the city on the day of receipt thereof, or on the business day next succeeding, in such banks, credit unions and trust companies as shall have been designated as deposit banks, but no amount shall be on deposit at any one time in any one bank, credit union or trust company exceeding one-half of the amount of the capital and net surplus of such bank, credit union or trust company.  The moneys so deposited shall be placed to the account of the commissioner who shall keep a record in which shall be entered the commissioner's accounts of deposits in, and moneys drawn from, the banks, credit unions and trust companies in which the deposits shall be made.
