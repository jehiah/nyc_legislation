[The department of citywide administrative services] All city mayoral and non-mayoral agencies, upon consultation with the department and the department of citywide administrative services, shall, in the development of new procurement specifications and for contracts that are either new or relet on or after the effective date of the local law which added this amendment review the such newly developed or existing procurement specifications [and practices it currently uses] to determine whether such [require that] specifications would exclude, eliminate or otherwise discourage the purchase of:\n      1.  recycled products or packaging made from post-consumer materials;\n      2. products or packaging [be] manufactured from [virgin] recyclable materials [or exclude products manufactured from secondary materials and shall make such changes as may be necessary to ensure that:\n   1. where such specifications and practices exclude the use of products manufactured from secondary materials or require that products be manufactured from virgin materials only, such exclusions or requirements be eliminated; provided, however, that specifications need not be revised if the department of citywide administrative services determines that for a particular end use a product containing secondary materials would not meet necessary performance standards;\n   2. performance standards, specifications and a product's intended end use are related, and clearly identified when feasible;\n 3. specifications are not overly stringent for a particular end use or performance standard; and\n   4. specifications incorporate or require the use of secondary materials to the maximum extent practicable without jeopardizing the performance or intended end use of the product; provided, however, where the department of citywide administrative services determines that for a particular end use a product containing secondary materials would not meet necessary performance standards, such specifications need not incorporate or require the use of secondary materials.\n   When used in this subdivision \"practicable\" means capable of being used without violating the following criteria: performance, availability at a reasonable price, availability within a reasonable period of time and maintenance of a satisfactory level of competition]; \n   3. products, packaging or equipment that have been remanufactured; or \n   4. products or packaging that facilitate waste prevention, including rechargeable batteries. \n\n\tb.  [In purchasing paper products made with and without significant recycled content, recovered from materials otherwise destined for disposal, the department of citywide administrative services shall, wherever the price is reasonably competitive and the quality adequate for the purpose intended, purchase the recycled product.

For the purpose of this subdivision, the department of citywide administrative services shall promulgate regulations establishing standards for the \"minimum amount of secondary material\" from which a product shall be manufactured. If, however, a bid is submitted for a product that is manufactured from secondary material but the department of citywide administrative services has not established a standard for the minimum amount of secondary material in such product the bid shall be submitted to the mayor in accordance with the requirements of this subdivision regardless of the amount of the secondary material from which such product is manufactured. Notwithstanding the above, the department of citywide administrative services may amend an existing standard or promulgate a new standard for the minimum amount of secondary material from which a product shall be manufactured.] Pursuant to section 104-a of the general municipal law, all mayoral and non-mayoral agencies shall, wherever recycled products meet contract specifications and the price of such products is reasonably competitive, purchase such products.  For the purposes of this subdivision, \"recycled product\" shall mean, any product which is manufactured from secondary materials as defined in subdivision one section two hundred sixty-one of the economic development law, and which meets the requirements of subdivision two of section 27-0717 environmental conservation law and regulations promulgated thereto.

When purchasing paper products and other products pursuant to this section, the department of citywide administrative services shall utilize the United States environmental protection agency minimum content standards for recycled materials content promulgated pursuant to 42 U.S.C. �6901 et seq.\n      e. Should the state authorize the city's use of a price preference for the purchase of any products manufactured from secondary materials, the commissioner shall propose appropriate legislation to mandate the use of this price preference.]\n      c. The review conducted pursuant to subdivision a of this section shall be utilized by all city mayoral and non-mayoral agencies to make any necessary change in such procurement specifications to ensure that:\n  \t1. such specifications do not exclude, eliminate or otherwise discourage the purchase of products, materials and equipment set forth in paragraphs one through three of subdivision a of this section;\n\t2. specifications for recycled products are in accordance with the standards provided in subdivision j-1 of section 16-303 of this chapter;\n\t3. waste prevention measures are considered in specifications for the procurement of products, packaging and equipment; and\n\t4. to the maximum extent feasible, products and packaging made from recyclable materials are used and excess packaging is eliminated; and\n \t5. performance standards, specifications and a product's intended use are related and clearly identified, when feasible.\n      All necessary changes required by paragraphs (1) through (5) of this subdivision shall be made to the maximum extent practicable, provided, however, that where a city mayoral or non-mayoral agency determines that the necessary changes required by paragraph (2) are not practicable, such agency must submit written documentation of such a determination to the mayor's office of contracts.
