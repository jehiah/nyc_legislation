Paragraph 1 of subdivision a of section 27-607 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 65 for the year 1990, is amended to read as follows:\n\t(1) STRENGTH TESTS. Strength tests shall be performed on all structural concrete. The provisions of reference standard RS 10-3 shall apply. A licensed concrete testing laboratory shall, in compliance with reference standards RS 10-17, RS 10-51 and RS 10-52, sample the concrete, make and cure the test specimens at the job site, transport the specimens to the laboratory and test the specimens for compressive strength. Written reports of the results shall be furnished to the architect or engineer designated for controlled inspection and to the concrete producer immediately, but not more than five days following the conclusion of the compression strength tests. Whenever a test specimen fails to meet the specified minimum strength requirements a copy of the written reports of the results for such test specimen shall be furnished to the department not more than five days following the conclusion of the compression strength test. Test specimens shall be stored on the job site in an insulated curing box of sufficient size and strength to contain all the specimens made in any four consecutive working days and to protect the specimens from falling over, being jarred or otherwise disturbed during the period of initial curing. The box shall be erected, furnished and maintained by the concrete contractor. Such box shall be equipped to provide the moisture and to regulate the temperature necessary to maintain the proper curing conditions required by reference standards RS 10-52. Such box shall be located in an area free from vibration such as pile driving and traffic of all kinds. No concrete requiring inspection shall be delivered to the site until such storage curing box has been provided. Specimens shall remain undisturbed in the curing box until ready for delivery to the testing laboratory but not less than sixteen hours. Specimens delivered to the laboratory prior to an age of forty-eight hours shall not be demolded prior to delivery. All specimens shall be carefully removed from the box and transported to the laboratory by the licensed concrete testing laboratory in accordance with the provisions of reference standard RS 10-52. All specimens shall be delivered to the laboratory before the laboratory closes at the end of the second working day following the day the specimens were molded. The date of arrival at the laboratory shall be recorded on the specimen test reports. All concrete failing to meet the specified minimum strength requirements shall be rejected by the architect or engineer designated for controlled inspection pending verification of the adequacy of the construction as described in section 27-598 of article three of this subchapter.\n\tï¿½2. This local law shall take effect ninety days after its enactment.\n\n\n_______\nNote: Matter in italics is new; matter in brackets [ ] to be omitted.",
