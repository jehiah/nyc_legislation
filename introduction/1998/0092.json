The maximum contributions set forth in this paragraph shall be adjusted in accordance with subdivision seven of this section. Any contribution made prior to the effective date of this chapter shall not be deemed a matchable contribution for purposes of this chapter for any election held in the year nineteen hundred ninety or thereafter;\n   \t�2.
