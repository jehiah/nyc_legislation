  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\n\tSection 1.  Declaration of Legislative Findings and Intent.  The Council finds that the city of New York must spend its public funds in a manner that serves the best interest of all New Yorkers and that all residents should have a voice in deciding if, a new stadium or facility should be constructed for the New York Yankees baseball franchise to be relocated from the Borough of the Bronx to the Borough of Manhattan. Construction of a new stadium raises many quality of life issues and would have an impact on the daily life of those who reside in the vicinity in which any new stadium might be located.  Additionally, any relocation of Yankee Stadium from the Borough of the Bronx would impact the community surrounding the existing Yankee Stadium and the economic viability of the Borough of the Bronx.  The Council therefore believes that it is not appropriate for the City to expend taxpayer dollars for the construction of a stadium for the New York Yankees to be relocated from the Borough of the Bronx to the Borough of Manhattan.  \n\t�2.  Section 227 of the charter of the city of New York is amended to add a new subdivision b and to re-letter the existing subdivision b as subdivision c to read as follows:\n\tb.\tYankee Stadium.
