  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\t Section one.  Legislative intent.  For many years, the New York State Attorney General has required, by regulation, sponsors of cooperative and condominium conversions to correct all hazardous violations prior to its formal acceptance of an offering plan. That regulation was recently been struck down by the New York Court of Appeals in 1988 as being beyond the scope of the Attorney General's statutory authority.\n\tMany buildings in this City that are in the throes of a conversion have suffered neglect at the hands of the sponsor or predecessors in title resulting in the existence of hazardous violations. It is unfair to saddle purchasers of apartments in these buildings with what may be large repair bills in order to correct these conditions.  Such purchasers of apartments in those buildings should be protected by local legislation imposing the obligation.\n\tAlthough current law imposes upon a sponsor of a cooperative or condominium conversion in New York City the obligation to establish a reserve fund, the size of that fund is set, not by its relationship to the cost of repairs, but by the sales price of the apartments.  The public interest warrants requiring the reserve fund to be at least equal to the cost of correcting hazardous violations of record existing at the time sales are made.\n\t�2.\tSection 26-702 of the administrative code of the city of New York is hereby amended by adding a new subdivision (e) to read as follows:\n\t(e)\t\"Hazardous violation of record\" - any violation of record at the time of the closing of a conversion that is classified by any governmental agency as either hazardous or immediately hazardous, any violation written by the Fire Department and any violation reflecting similar physical conditions and that is set forth in the offering plan or any succeeding amendments.\n\t�3.\tSubdivision (a) of Section 26-703 of such code, as enacted by local law seventy of nineteen hundred eighty-two, is hereby amended to read as follows:\n\t�26-703 Establishment of reserve fund.  a.  Within thirty days after the closing of a conversion pursuant to an offering plan the offeror shall establish and transfer to the cooperative corporation or condominium board of managers, a reserve fund to be used exclusively for correcting hazardous violations of record, for making capital repairs, replacements and improvements necessary for the health and safety of the residents of such buildings.  Such reserve fund shall be exclusive of any other funds required to be reserved under the plan or applicable law or regulation of the state attorney general, except a fund for correcting hazardous violations of record, and for making capital repairs, replacements and improvements substantially similar in purpose to an in an amount not less than the reserve fund mandated by this section.  Such reserve fund also shall be exclusive of any working capital fund and shall not be subject to reduction for closing apportionments.\n\t�4.\tSection 26-703 of such code hereby amended by relettering subdivisions (c) and (d) as subdivisions (d) and (e), respectively, and by adding thereto a new subdivision (c), to read as follows:\n\tc.\tNotwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (b) of this section, the offeror shall contribute to the reserve fund an additional amount which shall not be less than the cost of correcting all hazardous violations of record.\n\t�5.\tThis local law shall take effect immediately upon its enactment and shall apply to all cooperative and condominium conversion plans not yet accepted for filing by the New York State department of law pursuant to sections 352-e and 352-eeee of the general business law.\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2",
