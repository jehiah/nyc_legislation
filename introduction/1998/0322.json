Such appeal or a request for an extension of time within which to file an appeal, must be received by the commissioner no later than thirty days after the day of notice denying or rejecting the business enterprise's application for certification or recertification.  In the event that a request for an appeal is not made within the thirty day period, the director's determination shall be deemed final and the applicant may not reapply for certification for two years from the date of the written notice denying certification, provided, however, that if the facts and circumstances forming the basis of the denial decision have changed significantly, the applicant, may write to the director requesting permission to reapply, and the director may grant such permission by letter to the applicant.\n    \tb.  The appeal shall state the grounds upon which the denial of certification is being appealed.\n    \tc. The commissioner may extend the period in which to initiate an appeal for good cause shown.  Such appeal shall include, at a minimum, a description of the reasons why the decision to deny certification or recertification is in error and provide evidence to support its appeal.  Such persons shall provide such other documentation or information as is requested by the commissioner.

A certified business must notify the department within forty-two days of any material change in the information contained in the original application for certification or any subsequent material otherwise provided to the department.  A material change may include, but is not limited to, a change in any of the following: ownership; business address; officers or partners, where applicable; or services provided by the certified business.  If a material change occurs, a review may be conducted by the department and certification may be revoked. If a minority-owned business enterprises or woman-owned business enterprise's certification is revoked, such business enterprise may reapply for certification at any time following revocation. If a certified business fails to notify the director of such material change, the director may in his or her discretion, revoke or suspend , the certification of a minority-owned business enterprise or woman-owned business enterprise for a period to be proscribed by the commissioner.\n    \tb.  When the director or commissioner, has reason to believe or upon receiving allegations indicating that a certified business enterprise was not eligible for certification as a minority-owned business enterprise or woman-owned business enterprise or is no longer eligible for such certification, the director or commissioner may meet with minority group members or women claiming ownership and control of the certified business and may also conduct an audit of such business enterprise.  The director or commissioner shall thereafter take the following actions:\n    \t1.  Determine whether any allegation of can be substantiated;\n    \t2.  Obtain in writing, if possible, the basis of any allegation from the person or persons making the allegation;\n    \t3.

The minority group members or women claiming ownership and control of a certified business which has had its certification revoked, may appeal this decision within thirty days of the date of the notice of revocation.  Such appeal shall be conducted in accordance with procedures set forth in section 22-805 of this chapter.  If a request for an appeal is not made within that thirty day period, the director's determination shall be final and the business enterprise may not reapply for certification for two years from the date of the notice of revocation provided, however, that if the facts and circumstances forming the basis for the revocation change significantly, the business enterprise may, at the discretion of the director, be granted permission to reapply sooner.\n    \te. If at any time the department has reason to believe that an applicant or certified business has willfully and knowingly provided incorrect information or made false statements, it shall refer the matter to the department of investigation. Falsification of any document by an applicant or a certified business may lead to the imposition of civil and criminal penalties as provided by law, revocation of certification as a minority-owned business enterprise or woman-owned business enterprise and debarment from city contracts.\n    \t�22-807  City wide minority and woman-owned business enterprise utilization goals. a.  The goals which follow in this subdivision are citywide goals to be used by agencies in setting goals for their agency minority and woman-owned business enterprise utilization plans.  Agencies shall seek to ensure substantial progress toward the attainment of these goals.  The citywide goals are not to be summarily adopted as goals for individual procurements.  Goals for procurements by individual agencies may be set at levels higher, lower, or the same as the citywide goals, as the market circumstances warrant, based on factors described in section 22-812 of this chapter.  The goals for participation by certified minority-owned business enterprises and woman-owned business enterprises in procurements by the city of New York shall be as follows:\n    \t1.  For certified minority-owned business enterprises:\n    \ti) 8 percent of the city's total expenditures for goods;\n    \t(ii) 14 percent of the city's total expenditures for services; and\n    \t(iii) 14 percent of the city's total expenditures for construction.\n    \t2.  For certified woman-owned business enterprises:\n    \t(i) 8 percent of the city's total expenditures for goods;\n    \t(ii) 9 percent of the city's total expenditures for services; and\n    \t(iii) 9 percent of the city's total expenditures for construction.\n    \tb.  The commissioner shall periodically review the availability of certified minority-owned business enterprises and woman-owned business enterprises for participation in city contracts, and the city's utilization of such firms, and determine on the basis of such review and any other relevant information whether it is appropriate to initiate a rulemaking procedure for revising the goals set forth in subdivision a of this section.  In making such determination, the commissioner shall consider the extent to which discrimination continues to have an impact on the ability of minorities and women to compete for city contracts. The first such review shall occur within two years of the effective date of this chapter, and subsequent reviews shall occur at least once every two years thereafter.\n    \tc.\tBy December 31 of each year, beginning on the effective date of this chapter, the Commissioner shall publish an annual report for the fiscal year that ended on June 30 of such year.  Such report shall state, for each agency, and for the city:\n    \t1.  the number of contracts awarded, and the total dollars paid or to be paid pursuant to such contracts, as well as the total number of contracts awarded by the city and agencies with their dollar amount;\n    \t2.  the number of contracts awarded to each type of minority group member of certified minority-owned business enterprises and woman-owned business enterprises, the total dollars paid or to be paid pursuant to such contracts and a breakdown for each ethnic category on whether such dollars were for goods, services or construction;\n    \t3.  the number of contracts awarded which include a contractor utilization plan for participation by certified minority-owned business enterprises and/or woman-owned business enterprises, and the total payments made to such minority-owned business enterprises and woman-owned business enterprises pursuant to such plans; and\n    \t4. the fiscal year's original and any amended agency utilization plan with an explanation of why such plan was amended.\n    \tSuch report shall also indicate the extent to which agencies have met the goals set forth in their individual agency minority and woman-owned business enterprise utilization plans, as described in section 22-816 of this chapter.\n    \t(d) The department shall also keep a record of all contracts awarded to minority and women owned business enterprises with the contract award amount.  This record shall be kept on a quarterly basis and shall be available upon request to any member of the council or the public.\n    \t�22-808  Determining credit for participation in contracts by certified minority-owned business enterprises and woman-owned business enterprises. a. Agency credit.  For purposes of determining how participation by certified minority-owned business enterprises and woman-owned business enterprises in an agency's contracts shall be credited toward that agency's achievement of its annual goals:\n    \t1.  The total dollar amount that an agency has paid or is obligated to pay to a contractor which is a certified minority-owned business enterprise or woman-owned business enterprise shall be credited toward the relevant goal.\n    \t2.  The total dollar amount that a contractor which is not a certified business has paid or is obligated to pay to a subcontractor which is a certified minority-owned business enterprise or woman-owned business enterprise shall be counted toward the relevant goal.\n    \t3.  The total dollar amount paid or to be paid by a contractor which is not a certified business to obtain supplies or services from a certified minority-owned business enterprise or woman-owned business enterprise may be counted toward utilization goals, but only if the supplies or services are of the class of supplies or services identified by the contracting agency in its solicitation of bids or proposals as eligible for such purpose. Contracting agencies shall take and allow credit only for supplies or services that are specifically identifiable to the contract.\n    \t4.  The total dollar amount paid or to be paid to minority and woman-owned business enterprises may be credited either toward the goal for minority-owned business enterprises or the goal for woman-owned business enterprises, or apportioned between the goals for both.\n    \t5.  Where one or more certified minority-owned business enterprise or woman-owned business enterprise is participating in a joint venture, the percentage of the total dollar amount of the contract which is proportionate to the percentage of the net profit from the contract to which the certified minority-owned business enterprises or woman-owned business enterprises are entitled, as stated in the joint venture agreement, shall be credited toward the relevant goal.\n    \t6.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no credit shall be given for participation in a contract by any certified minority-owned business enterprise or woman-owned business enterprise that does not perform a commercially useful function, as defined in section 22-801 of this chapter.  The contractor shall have the burden of showing that a certified minority-owned business enterprise or woman-owned business enterprise is performing a commercially useful function.\n    \t7.  No credit shall be given for the participation in a contract\nby any firm that has not been certified in accordance with this chapter.  However, if a firm has been certified within thirty days of the end of the fiscal year in which it was awarded a contract or subcontract or used as a supplier or service provider, the contracting agency may count the participation of the firm toward its achievement of the relevant goal.\n    \tb.  Contractor credit.  For purposes of determining how participation by certified minority-owned business enterprises and woman-owned business enterprises shall be credited toward a contractor's achievement of a requirement for utilization of certified businesses in a contract, the provisions of paragraphs two through seven of subdivision a of this section shall apply.\n    \t1.  No credit shall be given in the evaluation of a bid or proposal for the participation of any firm that has not been certified in accordance with this chapter before the date that bids are opened, or the date that proposals are due.\n    \t2.  In the case of a contract that is awarded subject to a requirement that contractor identify after the date of award the certified businesses that will participate in the contract, no credit shall be given to the contractor for the participation of a minority-owned business enterprise or woman-owned business enterprise that is not certified before the date that such firms must be identified, as specified in the contract.\n    \t3.  In the case of a requirements contract:\n    \t(i)  for the purpose of evaluating bids, the \"dollar amount\" under the contract shall be determined on the basis of the bid price per item multiplied by the estimated number of items to be furnished to the city pursuant to the contract; and\n    \t(ii)  for the purpose of determining whether the contractor has achieved the utilization requirements set forth in the contract, credit shall be given to the contractor for the actual dollar amount paid or obligated to be paid to a certified business for its participation in the contract.\n    \t4.  In the case of a contract for which the contractor is paid on a commission basis, the \"dollar amount\" under the contract shall be determined on the basis of the commission earned or anticipated to be earned under the contract.\n    \t5.  In the case of a procurement in which the contractor pays money to the city in exchange for something of value which the contractor will obtain for performing the contract, the \"dollar amount\" of the contract shall be determined by subtracting the amount of money paid to the city from the estimated value of goods or services which the contractor receives or retains.\n    \t�22-809 Responsibilities of the division of economic and financial opportunity.  a. The division of economic and financial opportunity of the department shall prepare and regularly update a directory.  The division of economic and financial opportunity shall send copies of such directory to all agencies and maintain copies available for public inspection at its offices and other locations within each borough.\n    \tb. The division of economic and financial opportunity shall make its resources available to assist agencies and contractors in (i) determining the availability of certified minority-owned business enterprises and woman-owned business enterprises to participate in their contracts as contractors, subcontractors or suppliers; and (ii) identifying opportunities appropriate for participation by certified minority-owned business enterprises and woman-owned business enterprises in contracts.\n    \tc.

The Agency Chief Contracting Officer or an individual who shall work with the Agency Chief Contracting Officer shall be designated as the agency minority and woman-owned business enterprise officer and shall be directly accountable to the agency head concerning the activities of the agency in carrying out its responsibilities pursuant to this chapter.  If the minority and woman-owned business enterprise officer is not the Agency Chief Contracting Officer, then he or she shall work closely with the Agency Chief Contracting Officer to ensure that all agency procurement activity is conducted in a manner consistent with this chapter.  The responsibilities of such officer shall include, but not be limited to:\n    \ta. Implementing the agency's minority and woman-owned business enterprise program;\n    \tb.

Monitoring the agency's procurement activities to ensure that they are in compliance with this chapter;\n    \ti. Preparing plans and reports required by this chapter.\n    \t�22-811  Achieving agency minority and woman-owned business enterprise utilization goals - general provisions. a.  Each agency head is directly accountable for achieving the goals set forth in his or her agency's minority and woman-owned business enterprise utilization plan.\n    \tb.  In planning its procurement activities over the course of the fiscal year, each agency shall consider how it will achieve the goals set forth in its approved minority and woman-owned business enterprise utilization plan.  In planning how it will make individual procurements, each agency shall consider whether it  is appropriate to utilize any of the techniques described in this chapter in order to obtain or encourage participation of certified minority-owned business enterprises and/or woman-owned business enterprises.  This determination should be guided by the agency's knowledge of the market involved in the procurement, and the level of progress it has made during the year toward meeting its goal for the relevant category of procurement.\n    \tc.  Agencies shall seek to utilize certified minority-owned business enterprises and woman-owned business enterprises in all facets of their procurement activities, including contracts awarded by negotiated acquisition, and emergency contracts. Agencies shall seek to utilize certified businesses for all types of goods, services and construction they procure.\n    \td.  Agencies shall encourage eligible businesses to apply for certification as minority-owned business enterprises and woman-owned business enterprises pursuant to this chapter. Agencies shall also encourage certified minority-owned business enterprises and woman-owned business enterprises to have their names included on their bidders lists, seek Prequalification where applicable, and compete for city business as contractors, subcontractors and suppliers.  Agencies are encouraged to advertise procurement opportunities in general circulation media, trade and professional association publications and small business media, and publications of minority and women's business organizations; and send written notice of specific procurement opportunities to minority and women's business organizations.\n    \te.  Agency solicitations for bids and proposals shall include information identifying certified minority-owned business enterprises and woman-owned business enterprises engaged in businesses relevant to the contract, and/or advise prospective bidders and proposers where they may obtain such information.\n    \tf.  In planning procurements, agencies shall, to the extent practical and in accordance with the rules of the procurement policy board, shape the scope, specifications and size of a contract so as to enhance opportunities for certified minority-owned business enterprises and woman-owned business enterprises to participate.\n    \tg.  In addition to encouraging participation of certified minority-owned business enterprises and woman-owned business enterprises in its contracts by taking the steps described in subdivisions a through f of this section, the following techniques may be used by an agency, as appropriate, to achieve the goals set forth in its approved agency minority and woman-owned business enterprise utilization plan:\n    \t1.  Establishing a utilization requirement for participation of certified minority-owned business enterprises or woman-owned business enterprises in a contract, in accordance with section 22-812 of this chapter.\n    \t2.  Assigning credit for participation of certified minority-owned business enterprises or woman-owned business enterprises in evaluating proposals for contracts to be awarded through a competitive sealed proposal procedure, as described in section 22-813 of this chapter.  This technique may be used alone or in combination with the utilization requirements described in section 22-812 of this chapter.\n    \t3.  Utilizing targeted solicitations for purchases above the small purchase level, as described in section 22-814 of this chapter, in soliciting bids or proposals for contracts for goods and services for an amount of $10,000 or more, or for construction for an amount of $15,000 or more.\n    \t4.  Utilizing targeted solicitations for small purchases as described in subdivision b of section 22-815 of this chapter for contracts for goods and services for an amount under $10,000, or construction for an amount under $15,000.\n    \t�22-812  Contracts subject to minority-owned business enterprise and/or woman-owned business enterprise utilization requirements. a.  Agencies may establish utilization requirements for certified minority-owned business enterprises and/or woman-owned business enterprises in individual contracts.  The utilization requirements established for an individual contract may be less than, the same as, or greater than the relevant citywide goal or goals set forth in section 22-807 of this chapter.  In determining the level of minority-owned business enterprise or woman-owned business enterprise utilization that is to be required for a particular contract, agencies shall consider the following factors:\n    \t1.  the scope of work;\n    \t2.  the number and types of certified minority-owned business enterprises and woman-owned business enterprises available to perform such work, or portions of it, as indicated in the directory;\n    \t3.  whether the agency has structured the contract to create potential opportunities for certified minority-owned business enterprises and woman-owned business enterprises to act as participants in a joint venture, as subcontractors, service providers or suppliers, and the percentage of the dollar amount of the contract such opportunities should represent;\n    \t4.  the level of participation of certified minority-owned business enterprises and woman-owned business enterprises in similar contracts awarded by the agency, other city agencies, and on local projects awarded by the State and federal governments in the previous and current fiscal years; and\n    \t5.  the agency's progress to date toward meeting its annual goals for the participation of certified minority-owned business enterprises and/or woman-owned business enterprises, and the agency's expectations as to how future contracts will be used toward meeting such goals.\n    \tb.  A contractor may meet the utilization requirements for the contract in one or more of the following ways:\n    \t1.  The contractor may subcontract work to certified businesses, in which case the dollar amount of work to be paid to the certified businesses shall be credited toward the contractor's attainment of the relevant requirement.\n    \t2.  The contractor may enter into a joint venture agreement with one or more certified businesses, in which case the percentage of the total dollar amount of the contract which is proportionate to the percentage of the total profit from the contract to which the certified businesses are entitled, as stated in the joint venture agreement, shall be credited toward the contractor's attainment of the relevant requirement.\n    \t3.  If the contracting agency has indicated in the solicitation of bids or proposals that the purchase of classes of supplies or services from a certified business may be used for this purpose, the dollar amount a contractor pays to purchase such supplies or services from a certified business shall be credited toward attainment of the requirement.\n    \tA prime contractor which is itself a certified business may not count its own participation in the contract toward the attainment of a utilization requirement.  A contracting agency may use the techniques described in section 22-813 through section 22-815 of this chapter to encourage participation of certified businesses as contractors.\n    \tc.  When advertising to solicit bids or proposals for a contract for which a utilization requirement has been established, agencies shall include in the advertisement a general statement that the contract will be subject to utilization requirements for participation of certified minority-owned business enterprises and/or woman-owned business enterprises.  Agencies shall notify bidders and proposers in bid documents or requests for proposals of the specific utilization requirements established for individual contracts.\n    \td.  Agencies shall determine prior to issuing an invitation to bid or a request for proposals, and shall state in the invitation to bid or request for proposals, whether bidders or proposers shall be required to meet the utilization requirements set forth in the solicitation as a material term of the contract. In addition, the invitation or request shall state whether bidders or proposers:\n    \t1.  shall be required to identify in their bids or proposals the certified businesses that shall be engaged to achieve the utilization requirements; or\n    \t2.  shall be required to identify, by a date to be established in the contract, the certified businesses that shall be engaged to achieve the utilization requirements.\n    \te.  In the case of contracts for which the contracting agency has determined that bidders or proposers must identify in their bids or proposals the certified businesses that shall be engaged to achieve the requirements established for the contract:\n    \t1.  Within the period established for such purpose by the bid documents, request for proposals or other information provided to bidders and proposers by the contracting agency, bidders or proposers shall submit a contractor utilization plan indicating:\n    \t(i)   the type of work to be performed by certified businesses, and the amounts each is to be paid for such work;\n    \t(ii)   the name and employer identification number or the social security number of each certified business that will perform such work;\n    \t(iii)   verification letters from each such certified business evidencing that it has agreed to enter into a formal agreement for the work, and indicating the price agreed upon for such work; and\n    \t(iv)   where required by the contracting agency, the time frames when work to be performed by each such certified business is scheduled to begin and end.\n    \t2.  A bid or proposal which does not meet the utilization requirements established for the contract shall be rejected as non-responsive.\n    \tf.  In the case of contracts for which the contracting agency has determined that bidders or proposers shall be required to identify, by a date to be established in the contract, the certified businesses that shall be utilized to achieve the utilization requirements:\n    \t1.  Within the period established for such purpose by the bid documents, request for proposals or other information provided to bidders or proposers by the contracting agency, bidders or proposers shall submit a contractor utilization plan indicating:\n    \t(i)  a description of the type and dollar value of work to be performed by certified businesses.  With regard to this requirement, the plan may identify in the alternative parts of the work that may be used to fulfill the requirements for participation by certified businesses;\n    \t(ii)  where required by the contracting agency, the time when work to be performed by certified businesses is scheduled to begin and end; and\n    \t(iii) the manner in which the bidder or proposer intends to secure certified businesses to perform such work.\n    \t2.  A bid or proposal that fails to designate portions of the work in which there will be participation by certified businesses sufficient to meet the utilization requirements established for the contract shall be rejected as non-responsive.\n    \t3.  Within the time period established for such purpose in the contract, the contractor shall identify to the contracting agency the names and employer identification numbers or social security numbers of the certified businesses that will be participating in the contract, and the amounts each is be paid for such work.\n    \tg.  A contractor that fails to meet the utilization requirements set forth in its contractor utilization plan shall be subject to revocation, unless the contracting agency has granted a modification of such requirements pursuant to the procedure set forth in section 22-820 of this chapter.\n    \t�22-813  Competitive sealed proposals - minority and woman-owned business enterprise participation as an evaluation criterion. a.  A contracting agency may state in a request for proposals that participation by certified businesses or qualified joint business ventures as contractors will be one of the criteria used to evaluate a proposal.  The weight to be given this criterion for each contract shall be determined by the contracting agency.  A graduate minority-owned business enterprise or woman-owned business enterprise shall be ineligible to receive any points awarded in an evaluation pursuant to this subdivision.\n    \tb.  A contracting agency may state in a request for proposals that the level of participation by certified businesses as subcontractors, suppliers or service providers in a contract shall be one of its proposal evaluation criteria.  In evaluating proposals for such a contract the agency shall establish a weighted criterion for participation by certified minority-owned business enterprises and/or woman-owned business enterprises, and shall calculate the points to be given to each proposer for that criterion based upon the percentage of the total contract price to be paid to certified minority-owned business enterprises and/or woman-owned business enterprises.  The weight to be given the criterion described in this subdivision relative to other criteria used to evaluate the proposals shall be determined by the contracting agency for each contract, on a case by case basis.\n    \tc. The technique described in this section may be used together with the technique described in section 22-812 of this chapter concerning the establishment of utilization requirements, in order to provide proposers an incentive for exceeding the utilization requirements established for the contract.  The two techniques shall work together as follows:\n    \t1.  An agency shall state in its solicitation of proposals that all proposers must meet the utilization requirements established for the contract.  A proposer must show how it will meet such requirements, as specified in section 22-812 of this chapter, or its proposal shall be rejected as non-responsive.\n    \t2.  The agency shall also state in the solicitation that points shall be given in evaluating the proposals received for any participation of certified minority-owned business enterprises and/or woman-owned business enterprises at a level exceeding the utilization requirements.  As set forth in section 22-812 of this chapter, a certified contractor's participation in the contract shall not be considered in determining whether its proposals satisfies the utilization requirements.\n    \td.  Where a proposer seeks to earn evaluation points pursuant to subdivision b or c of this section, it shall include in its proposal a contractor utilization plan which shall indicate:\n    \t1.  the type and dollar value of work to be performed by certified minority-owned business enterprises and/or woman-owned business enterprises (including the prime contractor, if it is a certified business), and the amounts to be paid for such work;\n    \t2.  the name and employer identification number or the social security number of each certified minority-owned business enterprise and woman-owned business enterprise that will perform such work;\n    \t3.  verification letters from each such minority-owned business enterprise and woman-owned business enterprise that has agreed to enter into a formal agreement for the work; and\n    \t4.  where required by the contracting agency, the dates when work to be performed by each minority-owned business enterprise and woman-owned business enterprise is scheduled to begin and end.\n    \tSuch proposer's utilization plan shall be incorporated in any contract awarded to it pursuant to such subdivision.\n    \t�22-814  Targeted solicitations for contracts above the small purchase level. a. An agency head may designate individual procurements or categories of procurements of goods or services in an amount of $10,000 or more, or of construction in an amount of $15,000 or more, as procurements for which bids or proposals shall be solicited only from certified businesses, and qualified joint ventures which include certified businesses.  Agencies may solicit bids or proposals only from certified businesses that are on a list of prequalified vendors, and qualified joint ventures that include certified businesses that are on such prequalified vendor lists.\n    \tb.  When using this technique, the agency chief contracting officer shall establish a list of prequalified certified businesses in the following manner:\n    \t1.  The agency chief contracting officer may determine that the need for advance screening of  qualifications outweighs the benefits of a broader search for competition pursuant to section 3-11(d) of the rules of the procurement policy board, on the basis of a finding that a targeted solicitation to certified minority-owned business enterprises and/or woman-owned business enterprises and qualified joint ventures which include certified minority-owned business enterprises and/or woman-owned business enterprises is necessary to enable the agency to discharge its responsibility to secure the meaningful participation of certified businesses in the agency's procurements, as prescribed by section 1304 of the charter and this chapter.  The agency chief contracting officer's determination must be supported by findings that on at least two prior occasions the contracting agency has attempted unsuccessfully to involve certified minority-owned business enterprises and/or woman-owned business enterprises as contractors on contracts for the category of goods, services or construction involved in the subject contract, using other techniques described in the rules of the procurement policy board and this chapter, and by a finding that, based on the agency chief contracting officer's knowledge of the market, the targeted solicitation will generate adequate competition for the procurement.\n    \t2.  In establishing the list of prequalified vendors for the procurement, the agency chief contracting officer shall consider whether the firm has been certified by the division of economic and financial opportunity pursuant to this chapter (or in the case of a joint venture, whether such a certified business has an interest of 25 percent or more in the venture, as described in section 22-801 of this chapter), and such other general criteria set forth in section 3-11(e) of the rules of the procurement policy board as are appropriate.\n    \tc.

Such request shall be made in writing to the agency's minority and woman-owned business enterprise officer and shall be accompanied by supporting documentation.  The invitation for bids or request for proposals shall establish deadlines for the making of such a waiver request and for the agency's determination of the request.

A request for a post-award modification shall not be granted or denied without the approval of the city chief procurement officer.\n    \t3.

The contractor shall identify in writing the certified businesses from which it solicited bids or proposals.

The minority and woman-owned business enterprise officer shall provide the division of economic and financial opportunity and the city chief procurement officer written notice of the request for a post-award modification.

If, after having considered the contractor's efforts to achieve the requirement, and any other efforts that could be used to achieve the requirement in accordance with the original contractor utilization plan or a revised contractor utilization plan, the minority and woman-owned business enterprise officer finds merit in the request for a post-award modification, and the city chief procurement officer approves such determination, the minority and woman-owned business enterprise Officer shall reduce the requirement established for the contract consistent with the basis upon which the modification was granted.\n    \t7.  The contracting agency shall make a determination with respect to a request for a post-award modification within the time set forth for such purpose in the contract; provided that if the contracting agency officer has not made a determination within such time and the parties have not agreed to extend the time for making such determination, the contracting agency shall be deemed to have denied the request.

The commissioner, upon making a determination that women and/or any minority group as a class have not been discriminated against in their ownership and operation of a business in a particular trade, industry, service, or commodity market within the geographic market of the city, or are no longer disadvantaged in that geographic market by the effects of any such discrimination in the past, may promulgate a rule excluding procurements involving goods, services or construction in such trade, industry, service or commodity market from the\napplication .  The commissioner may make such a determination upon his or her own initiative, or upon a petition from any member of the public.\n    \t�22-828 Graduate minority and woman-owned business enterprise provision. a.

Except as provided in subdivision (c) of this section, a certified minority-owned business enterprise or woman-owned business enterprise shall be deemed to be a graduate minority-owned business enterprise or woman-owned business enterprise if it has maintained annual gross receipts for two consecutive years that are in excess of $17 million dollars.\n    \tc.  The commissioner, in his or her discretion, may by rule set a higher threshold of annual gross receipts for deeming certified minority-owned business enterprises and/or woman-owned business enterprises in a particular trade, industry, service, or commodity market to be graduate minority-owned business enterprises and/or woman-owned business enterprises.

When advertising to solicit bids or proposals for a contract for which a utilization requirement has been established, agencies shall include in the advertisement a general statement that the contract will be subject to utilization requirements for participation of certified minority-owned business enterprises and/or woman-owned business enterprises.  Agencies shall notify bidders and proposers in bid documents or requests for proposals of the specific utilization requirements established for individual contracts.\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul d.  Agencies shall determine prior to issuing an invitation to bid or a request for proposals, and shall state in the invitation to bid or request for proposals, whether bidders or proposers shall be required to meet the utilization requirements set forth in the solicitation as a material term of the contract. In addition, the invitation or request shall state whether bidders or proposers:\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul 1.  shall be required to identify in their bids or proposals the certified businesses that shall be engaged to achieve the utilization requirements; or\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul 2.  shall be required to identify, by a date to be established in the contract, the certified businesses that shall be engaged to achieve the utilization requirements.\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul e.

Within the period established for such purpose by the bid documents, request for proposals or other information provided to bidders or proposers by the contracting agency, bidders or proposers shall submit a contractor utilization plan indicating:\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul (i)  a description of the type and dollar value of work to be performed by certified businesses.  With regard to this requirement, the plan may identify in the alternative parts of the work that may be used to fulfill the requirements for participation by certified businesses;\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul (ii)  where required by the contracting agency, the time when work to be performed by certified businesses is scheduled to begin and end; and\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul (iii) the manner in which the bidder or proposer intends to secure certified businesses to perform such work.\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul 2.

A contracting agency may state in a request for proposals that participation by certified businesses or qualified joint business ventures as contractors will be one of the criteria used to evaluate a proposal.  The weight to be given this criterion for each contract shall be determined by the contracting agency.  A graduate minority-owned business enterprise or woman-owned business enterprise shall be ineligible to receive any points awarded in an evaluation pursuant to this subdivision.\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul b.  A contracting agency may state in a request for proposals that the level of participation by certified businesses as subcontractors, suppliers or service providers in a contract shall be one of its proposal evaluation criteria.  In evaluating proposals for such a contract the agency shall establish a weighted criterion for participation by certified minority-owned business enterprises and/or woman-owned business enterprises, and shall calculate the points to be given to each proposer for that criterion based upon the percentage of the total contract price to be paid to certified minority-owned business enterprises and/or woman-owned business enterprises.  The weight to be given the criterion described in this subdivision relative to other criteria used to evaluate the proposals shall be determined by the contracting agency for each contract, on a case by case basis.\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul c. The technique described in this section may be used together with the technique described in section 22-812 of this chapter concerning the establishment of utilization requirements, in order to provide proposers an incentive for exceeding the utilization requirements established for the contract.  The two techniques shall work together as follows:\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul 1.  An agency shall state in its solicitation of proposals that all proposers must meet the utilization requirements established for the contract.  A proposer must show how it will meet such requirements, as specified in section 22-812 of this chapter, or its proposal shall be rejected as non-responsive.\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul 2.  The agency shall also state in the solicitation that points shall be given in evaluating the proposals received for any participation of certified minority-owned business enterprises and/or woman-owned business enterprises at a level exceeding the utilization requirements.  As set forth in section 22-812 of this chapter, a certified contractor's participation in the contract shall not be considered in determining whether its proposals satisfies the utilization requirements.\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul d.  Where a proposer seeks to earn evaluation points pursuant to subdivision b or c of this section, it shall include in its proposal a contractor utilization plan which shall indicate:\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul 1.  the type and dollar value of work to be performed by certified minority-owned business enterprises and/or woman-owned business enterprises (including the prime contractor, if it is a certified business), and the amounts to be paid for such work;\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul 2.  the name and employer identification number or the social security number of each certified minority-owned business enterprise and woman-owned business enterprise that will perform such work;\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul 3.  verification letters from each such minority-owned business enterprise and woman-owned business enterprise that has agreed to enter into a formal agreement for the work; and\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul 4.  where required by the contracting agency, the dates when work to be performed by each minority-owned business enterprise and woman-owned business enterprise is scheduled to begin and end.\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul Such proposer's utilization plan shall be incorporated in any contract awarded to it pursuant to such subdivision.\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul\\b\\'a722-814  Targeted solicitations for contracts above the small purchase level.\\b0  a. An agency head may designate individual procurements or categories of procurements of goods or services in an amount of $10,000 or more, or of construction in an amount of $15,000 or more, as procurements for which bids or proposals shall be solicited only from certified businesses, and qualified joint ventures which include certified businesses.  Agencies may solicit bids or proposals only from certified businesses that are on a list of prequalified vendors, and qualified joint ventures that include certified businesses that are on such prequalified vendor lists.\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul b.  When using this technique, the agency chief contracting officer shall establish a list of prequalified certified businesses in the following manner:\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul 1.  The agency chief contracting officer may determine that the need for advance screening of  qualifications outweighs the benefits of a broader search for competition pursuant to section 3-11(d) of the rules of the procurement policy board, on the basis of a finding that a targeted solicitation to certified minority-owned business enterprises and/or woman-owned business enterprises and qualified joint ventures which include certified minority-owned business enterprises and/or woman-owned business enterprises is necessary to enable the agency to discharge its responsibility to secure the meaningful participation of certified businesses in the agency's procurements, as prescribed by section 1304 of the charter and this chapter.  The agency chief contracting officer's determination must be supported by findings that on at least two prior occasions the contracting agency has attempted unsuccessfully to involve certified minority-owned business enterprises and/or woman-owned business enterprises as contractors on contracts for the category of goods, services or construction involved in the subject contract, using other techniques described in the rules of the procurement policy board and this chapter, and by a finding that, based on the agency chief contracting officer's knowledge of the market, the targeted solicitation will generate adequate competition for the procurement.\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul 2.  In establishing the list of prequalified vendors for the procurement, the agency chief contracting officer shall consider whether the firm has been certified by the division of economic and financial opportunity pursuant to this chapter (or in the case of a joint venture, whether such a certified business has an interest of 25 percent or more in the venture, as described in section 22-801 of this chapter), and such other general criteria set forth in section 3-11(e) of the rules of the procurement policy board as are appropriate.\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul c.  The determination to employ this technique for a particular procurement or category of procurement, including the findings supporting the determination, shall be made in writing by the Agency Chief Contracting Officer, and must be approved in writing by the city Chief Procurement Officer.  The determination shall be valid for a period of two years from the date the determination was made; at that time, the agency shall review the need to continue to use this technique and advise the division of economic and financial opportunity of the results of such determination.\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul d.  If the contracting agency does not receive at least three responsive bids from certified business that were solicited pursuant to this section, it shall reject all bids and relet the contract.  Any certified business that submitted bids shall have the opportunity to submit new bids if the contract is relet.\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul e.  The technique described in this section shall not be used for contracts in excess of five million dollars unless such use has been approved in writing by the city Chief Procurement Officer.\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul f.  A graduate minority-owned business enterprise or woman-owned business enterprise shall be ineligible to compete for a targeted solicitation pursuant to this section.\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul\\b\\'a722-815  Small purchases.\\b0  a. Whenever an agency is soliciting bids for a contract for goods or services in an amount between $500 and $10,000 or a contract for construction in an amount between $500 and $15,000, and the agency is not using the small purchase targeted solicitation technique described in subdivision b of this section, the agency shall invite a number of certified minority-owned business enterprises and/or woman-owned business enterprises to bid that is equal to or greater than the number of non-certified business invited to bid, provided that if the agency has solicited bids from all certified minority-owned business enterprises and woman-owned business enterprises engaged in the business involved in the contract that are known to the agency, the agency may solicit bids from any number of non-certified business.  In circumstances where the rules of the procurement policy board require that solicitations for bids be done on a random basis, firms to be solicited for such contracts shall be selected from a list of certified businesses and a list of non-certified businesses.  Such selections from these lists shall be made at random.\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul b.  Targeted solicitations for small purchases.  1.  An agency head may designate individual procurements of goods or services for amounts under $10,000, or of construction for amounts under $15,000, as procurements for which bids shall be solicited only from certified minority-owned business enterprises and/or woman-owned business enterprises.  Where applicable rules of the procurement policy board require random selection of bidders for a contract, the firms to be solicited shall be selected at random from the list of available certified businesses.\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul 2. The technique described in this subdivision shall be used only when the agency minority and woman-owned business enterprise officer has made a determination, which shall be documented in writing, that on at least two prior occasions he contracting agency has attempted unsuccessfully to obtain participation of certified minority-owned business enterprises and/or woman-owned business enterprises as prime contractor, in contracts for the category of goods, services or construction involved in the subject contract, using other techniques described in this chapter and the rules of the procurement policy board.  The agency minority and woman-owned business enterprise officer shall notify the division of economic and financial opportunity of the agency determination to employ this technique.  Such determination shall be valid for a period of two years from the date it was made; at that time, the agency shall review the need to continue the use of this technique and advise the division of economic and financial opportunity of the results of such determination.\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul 3.  If the contracting agency does not receive at least two responsive bids from certified business that were solicited pursuant to this section, it shall solicit bids from at least three other firms before it makes the determination  as to which firm will be awarded the contract.\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul 4.  A graduate minority-owned business enterprise or woman-owned business enterprise shall be ineligible to compete for a targeted solicitation pursuant to this section.\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul\\b\\'a722-816  Agency minority and woman-owned business enterprise utilization plans.\\b0  (a) Each agency shall prepare an annual minority and woman-owned business enterprise utilization plan for that agency's procurement which shall be submitted to the commissioner.  In preparing its plan, each agency shall consider how certified minority-owned business enterprises and woman-owned business enterprises can be used in all facets of its procurements.  The agency minority and woman-owned business enterprise utilization plans shall be submitted by a date to be determined by the commissioner, which shall take into account the city's budget adoption process.

For purposes of complying with this statute, the contracting agency shall have the right to disapprove a contractor's selection of subcontractors.  The contracting agency shall allow a contractor a reasonable time to propose alternate subcontractors.\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul b.  A contractor shall not make any change in the participation by certified minority-owned business enterprises and/or woman-owned business enterprises set forth in its contractor utilization plan, unless it has obtained prior written approval from the contracting agency.  The contracting agency shall send written notice to the division of economic and financial opportunity of any such approval involving a reduction in utilization of certified minority-owned business enterprises or woman-owned business enterprises.  Application to the contracting agency for permission to make any change or substitution in a contractor utilization plan shall be made in writing and shall provide an explanation for such request.  The contractor shall certify that a copy of such request has been provided to any certified minority-owned business enterprise or woman-owned business enterprise identified in the approved contractor utilization plan for which it is requesting permission to award less work than was indicated in such plan.  The contracting agency shall make its determination with respect to such request within the time period established for such purpose in the contract, provided that if the contracting agency has failed to make a determination within such time and the parties have not agreed to extend the time allowed for such purpose, the contractor's request shall be deemed to have been denied.

If payments made to, or work performed by, certified business identified in the approved contractor utilization plan are less than the amount specified in the plan, the agency may impose sanctions as provided in section 22-823 of this chapter, unless the contractor has justified to the satisfaction of the contracting agency its failure to adhere to the contractor utilization plan.\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul\\b\\'a722-820  Waiver and modification of minority and woman-owned business enterprise utilization requirements.\\b0  a.  Petitions for waiver prior to the deadline for submission of bids or proposals.\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul 1.  Prior to the deadline for submission of bids or proposals, a potential bidder or proposer may request the contracting agency to grant a full or partial waiver of the minority-owned business enterprise and/or woman-owned business enterprise utilization requirements established for a contract, upon the grounds that the reasonable and necessary requirements of the contract render subcontracting or other participation of businesses other than the bidder or proposer infeasible, or infeasible at the levels required by the utilization requirements established for the contract.  Such request shall be made in writing to the agency's minority and woman-owned business enterprise officer and shall be accompanied by supporting documentation.  The invitation for bids or request for proposals shall establish deadlines for the making of such a waiver request and for the agency's determination of the request.  The deadline for the agency's determination of the request shall be no later than three business days prior to the bid opening date.  If the agency fails to act on such request before such deadline, it shall issue a notice to bidders or proposers extending the deadline for submission of bids or proposals until a reasonable time after such determination has been made.\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul 2.

If the contracting agency finds merit in the request for a waiver, it shall reduce the utilization requirement to the extent warranted.\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul 4.  When a contracting agency waives a utilization requirement, it shall provide notice to bidders or proposers of such determination in the same manner as was used originally to provide notice of the opportunity to bid or submit a proposal, prior to the date that bids or proposals are due.  The agency shall provide written notice of such determination and the reasons therefor to the division of economic and financial opportunity and the city chief procurement officer.  In the case of procurements of construction, the agency shall also provide such notice to a person designated by the mayor to receive such notification.\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul b.  Post-award modification.  1. Post-award modifications shall not be granted absent clear and convincing evidence that the contractor has made all reasonable efforts to obtain the participation of certified minority-owned business enterprises and woman-owned business enterprises to meet the utilization requirements set forth in its contractor utilization plan.\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul 2.  A request for a post-award modification shall not be granted or denied without the approval of the city chief procurement officer.\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul 3.  A contractor may request the contracting agency to grant a post-award modification of the utilization requirements established in its contractor utilization plan, upon the following grounds:\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul (i)   The contractor could not, after having made all reasonable efforts, as described in subdivision (c) of this section, and submitting documentation of such efforts to the agency, identify sufficient certified minority-owned business enterprises and/or woman-owned business enterprises to meet the requirement; or\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul (ii) The contractor has demonstrated that the prices offered by all certified minority-owned business enterprises and/or woman-owned business enterprises were exploitative, in that they significantly exceed prices offered by businesses which are not certified of comparable size thereby indicating that the certified businesses are attempting to earn a profit that exceeds the level typical in the particular industry.  The contractor shall identify in writing the certified businesses from which it solicited bids or proposals.  In determining whether the price offered by a certified business is exploitative, the minority and woman-owned business enterprise officer shall consider the nature of the product or service offered by the certified business; the geographic location of the site where the work is to be performed and the principal business address of the certified business; prices of similar products or services in the market area; whether the price offered by the certified business reflects the certified business's cost of doing business and evidence that discrimination affects minority and woman-owned business enterprises' cost of doing business in the market involved.\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul 4.  The minority and woman-owned business enterprise officer shall provide the division of economic and financial opportunity and the city chief procurement officer written notice of the request for a post-award modification.  In the case of a contract for construction or professional services related to construction, the minority and woman-owned business enterprise officer shall also provide such notice to director of the mayor's office of contracts to receive such notification.  The division of economic and financial opportunity and the minority and woman-owned business enterprise officer shall consult with appropriate contractor organizations, including organizations for minority and women contractors, and provide advice to the contracting agency as to the merits of the request.\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul 5.  In reviewing a request for a post-award modification, the contracting agency's minority and woman-owned business enterprise officer shall consider whether it is feasible for the contractor to achieve the utilization requirement established for the contract by substituting portions of the scope of work intended to be used for such purpose.\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul 6.  If, after having considered the contractor's efforts to achieve the requirement, and any other efforts that could be used to achieve the requirement in accordance with the original contractor utilization plan or a revised contractor utilization plan, the minority and woman-owned business enterprise officer finds merit in the request for a post-award modification, and the city chief procurement officer approves such determination, the minority and woman-owned business enterprise Officer shall reduce the requirement established for the contract consistent with the basis upon which the modification was granted.\\ulnone\\par\n    \\tab\\ul 7.  The contracting agency shall make a determination with respect to a request for a post-award modification within the time set forth for such purpose in the contract; provided that if the contracting agency officer has not made a determination within such time and the parties have not agreed to extend the time for making such determination, the contracting agency shall be deemed to have denied the request.  The minority and woman-owned business enterprise officer shall provide written notice to the contractor of the determination with respect to its request for a post-award modification.
