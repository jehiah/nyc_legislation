Section 27-210 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\n    \t�27-210  Final inspection.  a.  For purposes of this section, the term \"authorized representative of the owner\" shall mean a registered architect or professional engineer licensed under the New York State education law who may perform final inspections in accordance with this section for work other than for any which he or she has supervised or superintended or made an application for a work permit, including the preparation of any papers or plans which accompany such work permit. \n    \tb. Upon completion of the work, and before the issuance of any certificate of occupancy or equipment use permit, a final inspection of the work shall be made by the department or by an authorized representative of the owner, at which the architect, engineer, or other person who supervised or superintended the construction, \n\ninstallation or alteration work shall be present; and any and all failures to comply with the provisions of this code or other applicable laws and regulations shall be noted and the owner or lessee promptly notified thereof in writing.  Where the final inspection is made by an authorized representative of the owner a copy of such written notification shall be filed with the department.\n    \t�2.  Section 27-997 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\n    \t�27-997  Acceptance tests.  No new, relocated or altered equipment shall be placed in operation until it has been tested and an equipment use permit has been issued by the commissioner. [Such] Notwithstanding the provisions of section 27-210 of this code, such tests shall be made as required in section 27-999 of this article and shall be conducted by the person or firm installing, relocating or altering the equipment and all such tests, except those that are performed on an elevator by a private inspection company acceptable to the commissioner, shall be witnessed by a representative of the commissioner.\n    \t�3.  Subdivision a of section 27-1000 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\n    \t�27-1000  Inspection agencies and elevator repair services. (a) The required periodic inspections [shall] may, be made [by the department except that two of the five inspections required every two years for elevators and escalators shall be made] on behalf of the owner by an insurance company, elevator maintenance company, elevator manufacturer, elevator inspection company, or other person, each of which must be acceptable to the commissioner.  The department shall promulgate rules [and regulations] establishing criteria as to the qualifications of such companies or persons and a schedule for when inspections by an authorized representative of the owner may be made.  [Such owner shall cause such inspections to be performed between January first and September fifteenth of each year.]  Reports by private inspection agencies shall be on such forms and in such manner as required by the commissioner. Such reports shall be delivered to the owner of each elevator or escalator inspected listing all violations of any provisions of this subchapter within five days of the inspection, and a signed copy of the report of each inspection shall be filed with the commissioner.  The failure to have such inspection performed within the prescribed period and to file a copy of the report with the department [on or before September thirtieth of each year] shall be a violation of this section, which shall be punishable pursuant to the provisions of section 26-125 of title twenty-six of the administrative code.  After such violation is placed the owner may file such report and the department shall enter a notation in its records of the date on which such report was received by the department.  \n    \t�4.  This local law shall take effect one hundred eighty days from the date of its enactment.   \n\n    \tReferred to the Committee on Housing and Building.",
