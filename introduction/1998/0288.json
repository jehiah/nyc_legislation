No permit shall be issued until such agreement shall have been entered into with the department, and all such permits hereafter issued shall include therein a copy of this provision.\n      b. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of section 19-103 of this subchapter, where a permittee which is a franchisee of the city, a public utility company, a public utility corporation or the employer of the workers who are performing or have performed an activity on behalf of such permittee and for which work a permit to open a street was issued, has failed to pay the prevailing scale of union wages to those workers, such permittee and employer shall be liable for payment of the unpaid wages, interest thereon at a rate then in effect pursuant to section 14-a of the banking law and the civil penalties provided for in section 19-150 of this chapter and may also be subject to:\n      1. revocation of all outstanding permits issued by the commissioner to  such permittee and employer;\n      2. a prohibition on the issuance by the commissioner of any permits to  such permittee and employer for a period of six months for a first violation, for a period of one year for a second violation and for a period of five years for a third and each subsequent violation;\n      3. a debarment proceeding against such permittee and employer in accordance with chapter thirteen of the charter and the rules of the procurement policy board; and\n      4. a setoff against any payments due the employer and the permittee pursuant to any contract or other agreement with any city agency equal to the sum of the wages that should have been paid, the costs to the commissioner and the comptroller of enforcing the provisions of this section and any civil penalties imposed.\n      c. (1) Whenever the commissioner or the comptroller has reason to believe that a violation of this section has occurred, or upon receipt of a notarized written complaint alleging a violation of this section, the commissioner or the comptroller shall conduct an investigation to determine the validity of such belief or allegation and issue a preliminary determination within ten business days after the conclusion of such investigation.

A copy of such final determination shall be sent immediately thereafter by certified mail, return receipt requested, to, each complainant, if any, the permittee on whose behalf the employer was acting and the employer. Such final determination may be entered as a judgment in favor of the workers and the city.\n      (2) When a hearing is requested to contest the preliminary determination, such hearing shall be held within a reasonable time after the request and a final determination shall be issued within ten business days after the conclusion of the hearing.

The provisions of this section shall not in any way impair or impede  any other rights, duties, obligations or responsibilities of the comptroller pursuant to the charter, this code or any other provision of law.\n      �2.  The table of civil penalties set forth in paragraph one of subdivision b of section 19-150 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as renumbered and added by local law number 104 for the year 1993, is amended by adding a new line to follow the line beginning \"19-141\", to read as follows:\n      19-142 \t\t\t\t\t\t\t  5000\n      �3.
