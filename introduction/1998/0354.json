  "Summary": "",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection 1.  Legislative findings and intent. The City Council finds and declares that in the aftermath of federal welfare reform, thousands of new jobs are needed in New York City in order to employ those welfare recipients now required to work.  Since New York City has a large number of people seeking new jobs, and since the City's communities need additional services that these job-seekers can provide, a welfare-to-work program that will create new, temporary jobs in the public sector and in community-based organizations, and provide individuals with education and training, career counseling, and related services will represent both an investment in human capital and in the vitality of this City.\n\tMany individuals who need to make the transition from welfare to the work force face serious barriers to securing and maintaining successful employment, including a lack of marketable skills, education, work experience, and affordable childcare.  A welfare-to-work program that offers a real work experience, pays a living wage, and provides health and childcare benefits, along with meaningful education and training, can be instrumental in successfully moving people from welfare to the work force in a manner that increases their long-term employability and self-sufficiency.\n\tAccordingly, the City Council finds that a welfare-to-work program known as the transitional jobs program should be established in New York City.  The transitional jobs program will create temporary jobs in the public sector and in community-based organizations, and will provide participants of the program with education and training, career counseling, and related services.  The provision of support services will significantly increase a participant's chances of securing and maintaining permanent employment after his or her participation in the program.  In addition, the creation of new jobs in the public sector and in community-based organizations will help address the unmet needs of many communities throughout the City.\n\t�2. Title 21 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new chapter five to read as follows:\nCHAPTER 5\nDEPARTMENT OF EMPLOYMENT\nTransitional Jobs Program\n\t�21-501 Definitions.  Whenever used in this chapter the following words shall have the following meanings: \n\ta.  \"Affiliated organization\" shall mean a local government agency or community-based organization that is affiliated with a sponsoring organization and employs certified individuals.\n\tb. \"Case management\" shall mean the provision and coordination of services to participants to ensure their success in the transitional jobs program, and enhance their chances of securing permanent employment after their participation in such program.  Such services shall include, but shall not be limited to, providing education and training, career counseling, and childcare.  Such services shall also include assisting participants in obtaining all federal, state and local government benefits that they are otherwise entitled to, including, but not limited to, child care expenses, training-related expenses, food stamps, and medicaid or transitional medicaid.\n\tc. \"Certified individual\" shall mean an individual certified by the commissioner to participate in the transitional jobs program.\n\td. \"Commissioner\" shall mean the commissioner of the department of employment or the commissioner or head of any other department or agency that the mayor designates to administer the transitional jobs program.\n\te.  \"Community-based organization\" shall mean a non-profit organization providing services to, or operating for the benefit of, a particular community.  Community-based organizations may also include a trade union that offers apprenticeship or pre-apprenticeship  programs.\n\tf. \"Department\" shall mean the department of employment, or any other department or agency that the mayor designates to administer the transitional jobs program. \n\tg.  \"Participant\" shall mean an individual employed by a sponsoring or affiliated organization in the transitional jobs program following eligibility determination and certification by the commissioner.\n\th. \"Sponsoring organization\" shall mean a local government agency or community-based organization selected by the commissioner to employ or facilitate the employment of certified individuals, and to provide case management to participants, provided, however, that nothing shall preclude a sponsoring organization from being a public, non-profit corporation created pursuant to applicable New York state law.\n\ti.  \"Transitional jobs program\" shall mean a program designed to create temporary employment in the public sector and in community-based organizations, and to provide the participants of such program with education and training, career counseling, and related services, to enhance their ability to secure permanent employment after their participation in such program.\n\t�21-502 Transitional jobs program.\n\ta.  The mayor shall direct the commissioner to establish a transitional jobs program, which shall consist of a total of two thousand five hundred temporary jobs in the public sector and in community-based organizations, at least two-thirds of which shall be created within local government agencies in the public sector.  Such total number of two thousand five hundred temporary jobs shall exist for a period of thirty-six months, commencing on January first, two thousand one; provided, however, that each participant in the transitional jobs program shall only be employed by a sponsoring or affiliated organization for a period not to exceed twelve months, and that each specific job created pursuant to the transitional jobs program shall be retained for at least twelve months.  An initial group of two thousand five hundred participants shall commence employment on January first, two thousand one.  A second group of two thousand five hundred participants shall commence employment on January first, two thousand two, and a final group of two thousand five hundred participants shall commence employment on January first, two thousand three.\n\tb.  The jobs created in local government agencies pursuant to this chapter shall, consistent with applicable collective bargaining laws and agreements, be accreted to appropriate existing collective bargaining units.\n\tc. In implementing the transitional jobs program, the mayor shall direct the commissioner to select which local government agencies shall be sponsoring organizations.  In making such determination, the commissioner may work in cooperation with the commissioners of other local government agencies and may, consistent with obligations under collective bargaining laws and agreements, consult with the heads of collective bargaining organizations, and may consider each prospective agency's prior experience hiring welfare recipients and the unemployed, its prior experience assisting such individuals in finding jobs, its prior experience providing education and training, career counseling, and related services to its employees, its plans to address or fulfill the needs of communities throughout the city of New York, its plans to employ or facilitate the employment of certified individuals, its plans to provide case management to participants, and its plans to assist in the permanent placement of participants following their participation in the transitional jobs program.\n\td. In meeting the goal of placing participants in community based organizations pursuant to this chapter, the mayor may direct the commissioner to issue a request for proposals or to utilize any other procurement method that he or she deems necessary to select community-based organizations to become sponsoring organizations.  To determine which community-based organizations shall become sponsoring organizations, the commissioner may consider an organization's prior experience hiring welfare recipients and the unemployed, its prior experience assisting such individuals in finding jobs, its prior experience providing education and training, career counseling, and related services to its employees, its plans to address or fulfill the needs of communities throughout the city of New York, its plans to employ or facilitate the employment of certified individuals, its plans to provide case management to participants, and its plans to assist in the permanent placement of participants following their participation in the transitional jobs program. Where the employees of a community-based organization that has been selected to become a sponsoring or affiliated organization are members of a collective bargaining unit, such collective bargaining unit shall, consistent with applicable collective bargaining laws and agreements, have the opportunity to comment on such selection.  The commissioner shall respond to such comments within fifteen days of their receipt. \n\te. Each sponsoring or affiliated organization may employ any certified individual, and employment with a sponsoring or affiliated organization shall be for a period not to exceed twelve months. \n\tf.

Legislative findings and intent. The City Council finds and declares that in the aftermath of federal welfare reform, thousands of new jobs are needed in New York City in order to employ those welfare recipients now required to work.  Since New York City has a large number of people seeking new jobs, and since the City's communities need additional services that these job-seekers can provide, a welfare-to-work program that will create new, temporary jobs in the public sector and in community-based organizations, and provide individuals with education and training, career counseling, and related services will represent both an investment in human capital and in the vitality of this City.\\par\n\\tab Many individuals who need to make the transition from welfare to the work force face serious barriers to securing and maintaining successful employment, including a lack of marketable skills, education, work experience, and affordable childcare.  A welfare-to-work program that offers a real work experience, pays a living wage, and provides health and childcare benefits, along with meaningful education and training, can be instrumental in successfully moving people from welfare to the work force in a manner that increases their long-term employability and self-sufficiency.\\par\n\\tab Accordingly, the City Council finds that a welfare-to-work program known as the transitional jobs program should be established in New York City.  The transitional jobs program will create temporary jobs in the public sector and in community-based organizations, and will provide participants of the program with education and training, career counseling, and related services.  The provision of support services will significantly increase a participant's chances of securing and maintaining permanent employment after his or her participation in the program.  In addition, the creation of new jobs in the public sector and in community-based organizations will help address the unmet needs of many communities throughout the City.\\par\n\\tab\\'a72. Title 21 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new chapter five to read as follows:\\par\n\\pard\\ltrpar\\sl480\\slmult1\\qc CHAPTER 5\\par\nDEPARTMENT OF EMPLOYMENT\\par\nTransitional Jobs Program\\par\n\\pard\\ltrpar\\sl480\\slmult1\\tab\\'a721-501 Definitions.

Where the employees of a community-based organization that has been selected to become a sponsoring or affiliated organization are members of a collective bargaining unit, such collective bargaining unit shall, consistent with applicable collective bargaining laws and agreements, have the opportunity to comment on such selection.  The commissioner shall respond to such comments within fifteen days of their receipt. \\par\n\\tab e.
