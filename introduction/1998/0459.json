  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection one.\tSubdivision h of section 22-251 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 28 for the year 1997, is amended to read as follows:\n\th. \"Public wholesale market\" or \"market\" shall mean any building, structure or place owned by the city or located on property owned by the city or under lease to or in the possession of the city or any part of a street, avenue, parkway, plaza, square or other public place designated as a public market by resolution of the former board of estimate of the city or a local law enacted by the city council to be used or intended to be used for the wholesale buying, selling or keeping of food, flowers or ornamental plants and shall continue to be public property notwithstanding that such public wholesale market is operated pursuant to a lease or other agreement with a non-governmental entity; except that the term \"public wholesale market\" shall not, unless otherwise set forth in this chapter, include any building, structure or place within the fulton fish market distribution area or other seafood distribution area as defined in section 22-202 of this code.  For the purposes of this chapter, the term \"public wholesale market\" shall also include an area identified by rule of the commissioner that is in the vicinity of a designated [wholesale] public wholesale market where one or more wholesale businesses or market businesses operate.  For the purposes of this chapter, the \"place of business of a wholesale business or market business\" shall mean any building, structure, stall or other area, or any part thereof, within a public wholesale market that is leased, operated, managed or used exclusively by such wholesale business or market business.\t\n      �2.\tSubdivision a of section 22-253 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 28 for the year 1997, is amended read as follows:\n\ta.  No person shall conduct a wholesale business or a market business in a public wholesale market unless such person has registered such business with the commissioner and has obtained a registration number for such business from the commissioner. Application for such registration shall be made upon a form prescribed by the commissioner containing such information as the commissioner shall determine appropriately identifies and demonstrates the fitness of the wholesale business or market business. A registration number shall not be transferable.  A person conducting a wholesale business or a market business shall not sublease or assign to another person any portion of any premises in the market occupied or utilized by such business unless such proposed sublessee or assignee has registered with and obtained a registration number from the commissioner.  The commissioner shall establish by rule a procedure for the preliminary review of registration applications for businesses not previously operating in a market that are considering the purchase of a wholesale business or a market business, and for the expedited completion of registration review upon entry into a purchase and sale agreement. A business required to register pursuant to this section shall [, in accordance with rules promulgated by the commissioner pursuant to section 22-266 of this chapter,] inform the commissioner of any change in the ownership composition of the business, the arrest or criminal conviction of any principal of the business, or any other material change in the information submitted on the application for registration within thirty calendar days thereof. \n\t�3.\tSection 22-255 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 28 for the year 1997, is amended to read as follows:\n\ta. Visitor pass.  The department or a designee of the department shall be authorized to issue a visitor pass as a requirement for any person to enter a public wholesale market including but not limited to: retailers who enter the market to purchase products and their employees and temporary employees; and, subject to the provisions of sections 22-264 of this chapter, officers and business agents of labor unions or organizations covered by such section and officers and business agents of the affiliates thereof, including international unions, pension and welfare funds and others.  Such pass shall be in a form prescribed by the commissioner, may contain a photograph of such person and shall indicate the reason the person is visiting the market, whether such person visits the market on a regular basis or, in the event that such person does not regularly visit the market, the date for which such pass shall be valid.  The commissioner may provide for the issuance of permanent visitor passes to those persons who regularly visit a market, and shall provide for the expeditious issuance of passes at the market entrance to persons wishing to enter the market on a single or occasional basis.  A pass shall be in the possession of such person at all times when such person is in the market and shall be worn and visible in compliance with rules promulgated by the commissioner pursuant to section 22-266 of this chapter.  The department or, at the direction of the department, a designee of the department, shall be authorized to deny a [visitor's] visitor pass and entry into a market to any person whose presence may constitute a threat to the orderly operation of a market or who has failed to provide the identifying information required by the commissioner or the designee of the commissioner. The provisions of this section shall not apply to any public wholesale market to which access by the public has routinely been permitted without control, restriction or other regulation for no less than a year directly preceding the effective date of this provision; provided, however, that the commissioner may apply such provisions upon a determination that an emergency exists that necessitates the temporary restriction of access to such a market. For the purposes of this section, a \"designee of the department\" shall mean an agency of the city or, in the discretion of the commissioner, a wholesaler cooperative or similar organization.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit the denial of a visitor pass to a representative of a labor union or labor organization solely because such person seeks to engage in the lawful exercise within a public wholesale market of an activity protected under the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. �141 et seq., including, but not limited to, the lawful picketing of a place of business of a wholesale business or market business in connection with a legitimate labor dispute, except as may otherwise be prohibited by law. However, such person shall not impede any reasonable measure undertaken by a police officer or authorized employee of the department intended to control vehicle and pedestrian traffic within such public wholesale market or upon any street, avenue, parkway, plaza, square or other public place designated as a public market. The commissioner shall consult with the commissioner of labor relations prior to reaching any determination that an activity be a representative of a labor union or organization is not lawful under the National Labor Relations Act. \n      �4.\tSection 22-256 of the administrative code of the City of New York, as added by local law number 28 for the year 1997, is amended to read as follows:\n      �22-256 Fees. The commissioner shall by rule establish fees for photo identification cards, for registration and the renewal of registration, and for visitor passes issued pursuant to this chapter in amounts sufficient to compensate the city for the administrative expense of issuance of such photo identification cards, of registration and the inspections and other activities related thereto, and of issuance of visitor passes. Such rule may provide that a designee of the department perform administrative functions related to the issuance of photo identification cards or the issuance of [visitors'] visitor passes and that such designee may, with the approval of the commissioner, impose a fee for the performance of such functions.  For the purposes of this section \"designee of the department\" shall mean an agency of the city or, in the discretion of the commissioner, a wholesaler cooperative or similar organization.  Registration pursuant to this chapter shall be valid for three years.  A wholesale business or a market business shall be responsible for the payment of any fee imposed by this section with respect to an employee of such business or any person seeking to become an employee of such business.\n\t�5.\tSection 22-257 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 28 for the year 1997, is amended by lettering the existing section as subdivision a of such section and by adding a new subdivision b to read as follows:\n\tb.  In any civil action or administrative proceeding against an employee of a wholesale business or market business for a violation of this chapter or any rules promulgated pursuant thereto, it shall be an affirmative defense that the employee was acting within the scope of his or her employment when the action or actions constituting the alleged violation were committed and that such action or actions were committed pursuant to an instruction given to such employee by such wholesale business or market business or by any principal, officer or agent of such business, provided, however, that this subdivision shall not be applicable to a violation of section 22-252 or section 22-262 of this chapter and any rules promulgated pursuant thereto.\n\t�6. Subdivisions b and c of section 22-264 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 28 for the year 1997, are amended to read as follows:  \n\tb.  An officer of a labor union or labor organization required to be registered with the commissioner pursuant to subdivision a of this section shall inform the commissioner, on a form prescribed by the commissioner, of: (i) all criminal convictions, in any jurisdiction, of such officer; (ii) any pending civil or criminal actions to which such officer is a party; and (iii) any criminal or civil investigation by a federal, state, or local prosecutorial agency, investigative agency or regulatory agency, in the five year period preceding the date of registration pursuant to subdivision a of this section and at any time subsequent to such registration, wherein such officer has (A) been the subject of such investigation, or (B) received a subpoena requiring the production of documents or information in connection with such an investigation. Any material change in information reported pursuant to this subdivision shall be reported [forthwith] to the commissioner within thirty calendar days thereof. The commissioner may, if he or she has reasonable cause to believe that such an officer lacks good character, honesty and integrity, require that such officer be fingerprinted by a person designated by the commissioner for such purpose or by the department of investigation and pay a fee to be submitted to the division of criminal justice services and/or the federal bureau of investigation for the purpose of obtaining criminal history records.  \n\tc.  The commissioner may, after notice and opportunity to be heard, disqualify an officer of a labor union or labor organization from holding office when such person: (i) has failed, by the date prescribed by the commissioner, to be fingerprinted or to provide truthful information in connection with the reporting requirements of subdivision b of this section; (ii) is the subject of a pending indictment or criminal action against such officer for a crime which bears a direct relationship to the lawful and orderly operation of the market, in which case the commissioner may defer a determination until a decision has been reached by the court before which such action is pending; (iii) has been convicted of a crime which, under the standards set forth in article 23-A of the correction law, bears a direct relationship to the lawful and orderly operation of the market, including the specific duties and responsibilities necessarily related to the union office; the bearing, if any the criminal offense or offenses will have on the fitness of the officer to perform such responsibilities; the time which has elapsed since the occurrence of the criminal offense or offenses; the seriousness of the offense or offenses; and any information produced by the person, or produced on his or her behalf, in regard to his or her rehabilitation or good conduct; (iv) has committed a racketeering activity or associated with a person who has been convicted of a racketeering activity, including but not limited to the offenses listed in subdivision one of section nineteen hundred sixty-one of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization statute (18 U.S.C. �1961 et seq.) or of an offense listed in subdivision one of section 460.10 of the penal law, as such statutes may be amended from time to time, when the officer knew or should have known of such conviction; or (v) has associated with any member or associate of an organized crime group as identified by a federal, state or city law enforcement or investigative agency when the officer knew or should have known of the organized crime associations of such person. An officer required to disclose information pursuant to subdivision a of this section may submit to the commissioner any material or explanation which such officer believes demonstrates that such information does not reflect adversely upon the officer's good character, honesty and integrity.  If the commissioner determines pursuant to this subdivision that there are sufficient grounds to disqualify a person from holding office in a labor union or labor organization, the commissioner shall suspend such person from holding office pending final determination and, in the event such person is disqualified, such suspension shall continue pending resignation or vacatur of or removal from office. Upon written request of the suspended person within ten days of the commissioner's determination, the [commissioner] director of the office of collective bargaining shall [designate five] prepare a list of the names of the first fifteen arbitrators selected at random from the [list] roster of arbitrators approved by the office of collective bargaining and present the first five names on such list to the suspended person and the commissioner. [Such suspended person shall select one arbitrator from among the five arbitrators designated by the commissioner.] Within alternating periods of five business days the suspended person and then the commissioner shall each strike a name from the list of selected arbitrators. If the parties cannot within two additional business days jointly appoint an arbitrator from those remaining on the list, the suspended person and then the commissioner shall within alternating periods of two business days each strike an additional name from the list. The remaining arbitrator shall thereupon be appointed as the arbitrator for that proceeding and shall establish a schedule for such proceeding. In the event that such arbitrator declines the appointment or for any reason is unable to accept the appointment, then the director of the office of collective bargaining shall within five business days present to the suspended person and the commissioner the next five names on the list of arbitrators previously selected at random and the procedures set forth in this subdivision for appointing an arbitrator shall be applied to this second group. In the event that the arbitrator appointed from this second group declines the appointment or for any reason is unable to accept the appointment then the director of the office of collective bargaining shall present the remaining five names from the list arbitrators selected at random and the suspended person shall select an arbitrator from such group. Such arbitrator shall make a final report and recommendations in writing concerning the disqualification. The commissioner shall accept such report and recommendations and issue his or her final determination consistent with such report and recommendations.  In the event that the suspended person does not make [such] a request for arbitration within [such] the ten-day period he or she shall be disqualified from holding office.  Upon receiving an order of the commissioner pursuant to this subdivision disqualifying a person from holding office in a labor union or labor organization, such person shall resign or vacate such office within fourteen days or, if such person fails to resign or vacate such office within such time period, such union or organization shall remove such person forthwith from such office. Failure of such a person to resign or vacate office within such time period shall subject such person to the penalties set forth in subdivision a of section 22-258 of this chapter.  An [office-holder] officer who has been disqualified or suspended by the commissioner pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision may be excluded by the commissioner from the market.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the commissioner to disqualify a labor union or labor organization from representing or seeking to represent employees of a business required to be registered pursuant to section 22-253 of this code.\t\n\t�7. \tSubdivision b of section 22-265 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 28 for the year 1997, is amended to read as follows: \n\tb.\tAn officer of a wholesale trade association required to register pursuant to this section shall inform the commissioner, on a form prescribed by the commissioner, of: (i) all criminal convictions, in any jurisdiction, of such officer; (ii) any pending civil or criminal actions to which such officer is a party; and (iii) any criminal or civil investigation by a federal, state, or local prosecutorial agency, investigative agency or regulatory agency, in the five year period preceding the date of registration pursuant to subdivision a of this section and at any time subsequent to such registration, wherein such officer has (A) been the subject of such investigation, or (B) received a subpoena requiring the production of documents or information in connection with such an investigation.
