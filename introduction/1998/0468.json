Sale of tobacco products in such places, other than by a vending machine, shall be made only to an individual who demonstrates, through a driver's license or other photographic identification card issued by a government entity or educational institution [indicating], that the individual is at least eighteen years of age.  Such identification need not be required of any individual who reasonably appears to be at least twenty-five years of age, provided, however, that such appearance shall not constitute a defense in any proceeding alleging the sale of a tobacco product to an individual under eighteen years of age.\n\nÂ§8. Section 17-623 of such code, as added by local law number 83 for the year 1992, is amended to read as follows:\n\nÂ§17-623 Enforcement.

Subdivisions a and b of section 17-624 of such code, as added by local law number 83 for the year 1992, are amended, and a new subdivision e is added, to read as follows:\n\na.

In addition, for a [third] second and all subsequent violations at the same place of business within a two-year period, any person who engages in business as a retail dealer shall be subject to the mandatory [suspension] revocation of his or her cigarette license for such place of business[, for a period not to exceed one year].  For purposes of this section, any violation of section 17-618, 17-619 or 17-620 by any license holder at a place of business shall be included in determining the number of violations by any subsequent license holder at the same place of business unless the subsequent license holder provides the commissioner of consumer affairs with adequate documentation demonstrating that the subsequent license holder acquired the premises or business through an arm's length transaction as defined in subdivision e of this section and that the sale or lease was not conducted, in whole or in part, for the purpose of permitting the original licensee to avoid the effect of violations on the premises.  A cigarette license shall be [suspended] revoked at the same hearing at which a retail dealer is found liable for a [third] second violation or subsequent violations at the same place of business within a two-year period.  Any person who shall knowingly make a false statement or who shall falsify or allow to be falsified any record or report required by section 17-621, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine of not less than five hundred dollars nor more than one thousand five hundred dollars, or by imprisonment not to exceed six months, or both.  Any person who shall make a false statement or who shall falsify or allow to be falsified any record or report required by section 17-621, or who shall fail to maintain any record or submit any report required by section 17-621, shall be liable for a civil penalty of not less than three hundred dollars nor more than one thousand five hundred dollars.  Any person who violates section 17-622 shall be liable for a civil penalty of not more than fifty dollars for each violation.   \n\n\tb.\tA proceeding to recover any civil penalty authorized pursuant to the provisions of subdivision a of this section for a violation of section 17-618, 17-619 or 17-620 of this chapter shall be commenced by the service of a notice of violation which shall be returnable to the administrative tribunal established by the board of health where the department of health issues such notice or the adjudication division of the department of consumer affairs where that department or a designated employee of any authorizing agency or the department of finance issues such notice.  Such notice shall contain a statement that any hearing for a [third] second violation or subsequent violations of section 17-618, 17-619 or 17-620 at the same place of business within a two-year period shall also constitute a hearing for the [suspension] revocation of a retail dealer's cigarette license where the retail dealer is found to be in violation of any such sections.
