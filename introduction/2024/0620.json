  "Summary": "This bill would require the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene to develop written materials containing information about the potential negative consequences of prescribing and using prescription drugs for off-label use for weight loss, including but not limited to medical side effects and reductions in drug supply. The materials would have to include a statement encouraging hospitals to share the materials with patients. The Commissioner would be required to post the materials on the website of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. The Commissioner would also have to provide the materials to hospitals unaffiliated with New York City for distribution to patients at the hospitals’ discretion. Additionally, the Commissioner would be required to provide the materials to hospitals under the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (NYC Health + Hospitals) for distribution to patients at the discretion of NYC Health + Hospitals.",
