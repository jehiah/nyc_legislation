  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Buildings (“DOB”) to publish a report on the time elapsed to correct violations in certain residential buildings, including information such as the number of days between when DOB issued a notice of violation to when DOB accepted the correction, and whether the violation remained uncorrected for more than 6 months. Additionally, when a property owner has been issued a vacate order and seeks to demolish the building, the owner would be required to submit documentation to show the steps taken to correct unresolved violations related to the vacate order before seeking to demolish a building.",
