  "Summary": "This bill would require the respondent of a Department of Buildings violation to correct major and lesser violations within 30 days from the date of the order and correct immediately hazardous violations forthwith. DOB would also be required to publish a report on the time elapsed to correct violations in certain residential buildings, including information such as the number of days from the issuance of the notice of violation to when the correction was accepted by DOB and whether the violation remained uncorrected for more than 6 months. Additionally, this bill would require building owners to submit additional documentation when seeking to demolish a building. Finally, the bill would add orders of correction for Housing Maintenance Code violations as a factor to deny a certificate of no harassment under the Certification of No Harassment program.",

The owner of the pilot program building for which a certification of no harassment is sought shall have the opportunity to be heard at such hearing prior to the granting or denial of such certification. The department may receive testimony from tenants, community groups and any other interested parties.
