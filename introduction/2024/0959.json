  "Summary": "This bill would establish a program administered by the Department of Veterans' Services in coordination with the Department of Social Services to provide monthly rental assistance to homeless veterans, covering their monthly housing rent up to a maximum amount based on the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development’s fair market rent guidelines. Veterans would not be required to contribute from their income toward rent. To be eligible, a veteran would need to have a gross income not exceeding 200% of the federal poverty level, not be receiving another governmental housing subsidy, and be a New York City resident. The Commissioner of Veterans’ Services would have to periodically reassess eligibility and discontinue assistance if a veteran no longer meets the eligibility criteria or secures permanent housing that does not require rent payments. Finally, the Commissioner would have to conduct outreach to landlords and homeless veterans about this program.",
