  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to report on the status of any studies it is involved in relating to groundwater levels in Southeast Queens. This bill also creates an interagency task force to recommend changes in law regarding flooding adaptation assistance in Southeast Queens. Such task force would disband upon the submission of its fifth annual report. Additionally, the bill would require DEP to administer a partnership program that would facilitate information sharing regarding flooding conditions and sewer infrastructure with organizations that provide flood adaptation assistance to NYC homeowners. Finally, the bill would require the Department of Buildings to answer questions and provide information about flood-related retrofits, repairs, and renovations at their monthly information sessions, and provide flood adaptation assistance resource guides authored by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development.",
