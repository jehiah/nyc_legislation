  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to issue a request for proposals for a community-based organization (CBO) to identify residential properties citywide that have experienced damage from groundwater flooding and, for a period of at least five years, connect those properties to retrofit repair assistance, provide case management support, and provide information regarding such assistance via mailings. It would also require the contracted CBO to submit an annual report on the number of such properties, the damage sustained, the estimated cost of retrofit repairs, and recommendations to improve the assistance programs. DEP would be required to submit the CBO’s feedback to any state or federal agency administering such assistance programs.  DEP would be required to report on the status of any studies it is involved in relating to groundwater levels in Southeast Queens. This bill also creates an interagency task force to recommend changes in law regarding flooding adaptation assistance in Southeast Queens. Such task force would disband upon the submission of its fifth annual report.",
