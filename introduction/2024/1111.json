  "Summary": "This bill would change the frequency with which the Campaign Finance Board recalculates contribution and expenditure limits to account for changes in the consumer price index from once every four years to once every local general election. This means that, in those instances that occur once every 20 years in which members of the Council serve two-year terms, the contribution and expenditure limits for candidates for the Council will be recalculated prior to the next general election.",
