  "Summary": "This bill would require that any person offering an OSHA-authorized 10-hour or 30-hour health and safety course display information about the instructor, including the instructor’s name, training authorization expiration, authorizing training organization, and where applicable, the trainer identification number. This information would allow prospective students to verify an instructor’s authorization to provide the health and safety course. The bill would also require the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, in collaboration with the Department of Buildings, to conduct a campaign to educate workers about common fraudulent schemes related to health and safety courses.",
