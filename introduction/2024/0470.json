  "Summary": "This bill would require tire shops to obtain a license in order to operate their business in the City. The application term would be two years, and there would be a biennial fee of $200. The department of consumer and worker protection could refuse to issue or renew a license, or suspend or revoke a license if the tire shop violates the conditions of the license, including obstructing or misusing public streets and sidewalks, and failing to appropriately manage and recycle waste tires. Tire shops that violate license conditions could also be subject to penalties determined by the department.",
