  "Summary": "This bill would increase the frequency of Department of Probation (DOP) reports on programs offered to probationers, compliance with departmental mandates, and recidivism rates. In addition, the reports will now require information on the specific nature of technical probation violations and clarify that DOP is to provide information on all the programs they administer.",
