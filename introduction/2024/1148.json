  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Social Services (DSS) to provide an application confirmation notice within 48 hours after submission, and document receipts within 5 days of submission, to any applicant for cash assistance or SNAP benefits. The application confirmation notice would include the date of the application submission, a description of the information received, and an acknowledgement of whether the application is complete, and if incomplete, information on how to complete the application. The document receipts would include the date the document was received, the type of document, the name of the individual whose information is contained in such document, and a determination of whether or not the document is legible. DSS would also be required to make an electronic copy of submitted documents available to the applicant to view. \r\n\r\nThis bill would also require DSS to produce a report on the resources that would be required to provide application confirmation notices and document receipts for additional benefits not already covered by the bill. The report would include an analysis of legal or operational barriers to providing application confirmation notices and document receipts, a determination of the minimum timeframe required by the department to implement this process, and an implementation plan to establish this process.\r\n\r\nThis bill would also correct numbering in the administrative code.",
