  "Summary": "This bill would require the Mayor to designate an office or agency to conduct a feasibility study on the creation of a linkage fee. A linkage fee is a fee that a developer would pay for any residential or commercial construction project that is larger than 100,000 square feet. The fee would fund job training for workers to be employed at the project site and for job contribution, which is paid into a trust for the benefit of the community within a 2 mile radius of the job site. In order to determine whether a linkage fee would be feasible in New York City, the designated agency or office would be required to conduct a study to provide information on the estimated funding needs, potential revenue, an estimated reasonable fee amount, various employment data, and an assessment of development projects. One year from the effective date of this local law, the designated office or agency would submit to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council the findings of the report and post it on its website.",
