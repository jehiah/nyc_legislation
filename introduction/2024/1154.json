  "Summary": "This bill would require that the Department of Transportation (“DOT”) test high visibility pavement markings that could be more visible to road users in poor driving conditions. DOT would be required to submit a report on the findings of the testing. If the DOT commissioner determines that some of the tested markings are likely to improve traffic safety during poor driving conditions, the commissioner would be required to implement a pilot program to install those high visibility pavement markings in multiple locations in each borough. If a pilot program is established, DOT would be required to submit a report on the findings and recommendations from the pilot program.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. High visibility pavement marking pilot program. a. Definitions. For purposes of this local law, the following terms have the following meanings:\n      Commissioner. The term \"commissioner\" means the commissioner of transportation.\n      Department. The term \"department\" means the department of transportation. \n      High visibility pavement marking. The term \"high visibility pavement marking\" means a pavement marking that, due to characteristics such as retroreflectivity or photoluminescence, the commissioner believes could be more highly visible to road users in poor driving conditions than the pavement markings most commonly used on streets in the city as of December 1, 2025.\n      Pavement marking. The term \"pavement marking\" means a line or symbol on the roadway that is intended to direct vehicular, pedestrian, or cyclist movement.\n      Poor driving conditions. The term \"poor driving conditions\" means conditions where the visibility of pavement markings by the operator of a vehicle or a pedestrian may be reduced, such as after sunset or during inclement weather.\n      b. Testing program. No later than January 1, 2027, the department shall test no fewer than 3 different types of high visibility pavement marking products that are not currently utilized by the department, except that if fewer than 3 such products may be procured by the department then only those products that may be procured shall be tested. As part of such test, the department shall evaluate each such tested product, including evaluating their durability and visibility in different poor driving conditions, and shall assess the operational feasibility of using each such tested product on a more widespread basis within the city. \n      c. Pilot program. If the commissioner determines that a high visibility pavement marking would both be feasible to install throughout the city and likely to improve traffic safety during poor driving conditions, the commissioner shall establish a pilot program no later than January 1, 2028 to install such high visibility pavement markings in at least 5 locations in each borough, provided, however, that if the commissioner determines there are fewer than 5 locations in a borough where such installation would be likely to improve traffic safety, the department may install fewer than 5 such high visibility pavement markings in such borough. The commissioner shall prioritize evaluating locations with a history of traffic related injuries or fatalities for inclusion in the pilot program.\n      d. Report. 1. No later than 2 months after the conclusion of the testing program required by subdivision b of this local law, the commissioner shall submit to the mayor and speaker of the council a report detailing the findings of such testing program, including any challenges and issues presented by such testing program, and a recommendation on whether to conduct a pilot program pursuant to such findings. \n      2. If a pilot program is established pursuant to subdivision c of this local law, 1 year after the conclusion of such pilot program, the commissioner shall submit to the mayor and speaker of the council a report that includes a recommendation on whether to expand or make permanent such program, and shall also identify any challenges and issues presented by such pilot program.\n      � 2. This local law takes effect immediately.\n\n\nNAW/MC\nLS #14202/16326\n11/25/25 9:02 PM\n\n\n      2\n      \n      \n      2",
