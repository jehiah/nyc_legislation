  "Summary": "This bill would make amendments to the Third Party Transfer (“TPT”) program. Through the TPT program, the City forecloses on financially and physically distressed properties and transfers them to a third party for rehabilitation. This bill would expand the definition of distressed properties, create additional notice requirements to property owners and building residents, and provide opportunities for building owners to avoid the transfer of their property in particular circumstances, among other changes to the program.",

Such class 1 real property is eligible for removal where the owner demonstrates:\n\t\ta. The owner has used such property as their primary residence for an uninterrupted period of not less than 12 months immediately preceding the owner's request for removal, except that a hospitalization or temporary stay in a nursing home or rehabilitation facility for a period of not more than 3 years shall toll the requirement to maintain primary residence for 12 uninterrupted months; and\n \tb.

Section 11-409 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 37 for the year 1996, is amended to read as follows:\n\t� 11-409 Severance and trial of issues where answer is interposed; [installment] payment plan agreements authorized after action commenced. a. If a duly verified answer is served upon the corporation counsel not later than [twenty] 20 days after the last date for redemption, the answering defendant shall have the right to a severance of the action, as to any parcel in which the defendant has pleaded an interest, upon written demand therefor filed with or made a part of [his or her] the defendant's answer. \n\tb. When such answer is interposed, the court shall summarily hear and determine the issues raised by the complaint and answer in the same manner as it hears and determines other actions, except as herein otherwise provided. Proof that the taxes which made said property subject to foreclosure hereunder together with interest and penalties thereon, were paid before filing of the list of delinquent taxes or that the property was not subject to tax shall constitute a complete defense.\n\tc. [No counterclaim may be asserted in an answer interposed in an action brought pursuant to this chapter. Where a counterclaim is asserted in an in rem answer the city may disregard that portion of the answer and shall suffer no legal penalty or impediment in the prosecution of its in rem action for its failure to reply or respond thereto. Where an answer contains only a counterclaim and no other defenses the city may proceed to judgment of foreclosure against the property affected without the need for moving against the answer. \n\td.] When a verified answer alleges [a substantial] equity [over] of at least 50 percent of the city's lien for taxes, the defendant may demand additional time in which to pay the taxes and interest or to have the property sold with all taxes and interest to be paid out of the proceeds of such sale. Upon such demand a defendant shall have the right to an extension of time for such purpose not in excess of [six months] 180 days from the last day to interpose an answer. Where a mortgagee or lienor who has interposed such answer commences a proceeding to foreclose [his or her] such party's mortgage or lien and it appears that with due diligence such proceeding cannot be concluded in time to allow the payment of taxes within the aforesaid [six month] 180 day period, the court may, on application before the end of said [six month] 180 day period, authorize an additional period during which such proceeding may be concluded and the taxes, together with interest and penalties, paid.\n\t[e.] d. Where an answer of the type described in subdivision [d] c of this section is interposed and taxes are paid within the period set forth in such subdivision [d] c, the commissioner of finance shall issue a certificate of withdrawal as to the property on which such payment has been made pursuant to the provisions of section 11-413 [of this chapter]. When taxes are not paid within the period set forth in such subdivision [d] c, it shall be deemed that there was no equity over the city's tax liens and the answer shall be deemed to be without merit. The city in that event may proceed to judgment of foreclosure against such property without moving against the answer.\n\t[f.] e. All answers interposed in an action hereunder and all affidavits and other papers pertaining to any litigation involving such answers or to any proceeding brought pursuant to this chapter involving less than an entire action shall bear a caption containing the in rem action number of the city's tax foreclosure proceeding, the borough or the section of a tax map or portion of a section of a tax map affected, and if the action covers less than all parcels in an entire borough or section of a tax map or portion of a section of a tax map, the particular class or classes, and the serial, section, block, and lot numbers of the parcel or parcels in issue.\n\t[g.] f. The corporation counsel, when submitting an in rem judgment roll pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, may request a severance as to any parcel on which an in rem answer or litigation is pending, or as to which, before the preparation of said in rem judgment roll is commenced, an agreement was duly made, executed and filed with the commissioner of finance for the payment of the delinquent taxes, assessments, or other legal charges [and], interest, and penalties in installments as provided in subdivision c of section 11-405 [of this chapter] and there has been no default in such agreement as to either quarterly installments or current taxes, assessments, or other legal charges. [Where such an agreement is entered into subsequent to the last date for redemption specified in subdivision a of section 11-407 of this chapter, there shall be paid to the commissioner of finance at the time the aforesaid agreement is executed an amount equal to the penalty which would have been payable under subdivision c of section 11-407 of this chapter had the person executing the agreement made a late redemption payment. Such amount shall be in addition to any installment payments required to be made under the agreement and shall not be credited against any such installment payments. Where a default occurs in such agreement as to either quarterly installments or current  taxes, assessments or other legal charges, all payments made under the agreement shall be forfeited and the city shall be entitled to acquire the parcel as to which the default occurred. Where such default occurs before the submission of the judgment roll, the parcels as to which such default occurs shall be included in said judgment roll among the parcels to be acquired by the city. Where such default has occurred as to a parcel severed pursuant to this subdivision, the corporation counsel shall cause to be entered a supplemental judgment of foreclosure as to such parcel immediately on notification by the commissioner of finance of such default. Where such installment agreement is paid in full the commissioner of finance shall discontinue the in rem action from which said parcel was severed by issuing a certificate of withdrawal as to said parcel pursuant to the provisions of section 11-413 of this chapter. \n\th.] g. 1. A party who has interposed an answer as to any parcel included in an in rem tax foreclosure action, or any other party interested in such parcel, shall have the right, at any time prior to the final disposition of a motion to strike said answer, to pay all taxes, assessments, and other legal charges and interest owing on said parcel. An answering party who makes such payment shall not be required to pay any penalty. [Where such payment is made by other than an answering party after the expiration of the period of redemption, there shall be paid to the commissioner of finance an additional amount equal to the penalty payable under subdivision c of section 11-407 of this chapter.] Where all delinquent taxes, assessments, and other legal charges together with lawful interest thereon [and penalties], where required, are paid, the commissioner of finance shall issue a certificate of withdrawal as to said parcel pursuant to the provisions of section 11-413 [of this chapter]. Said parties may also pay such taxes, assessments, and other legal charges and interest by [an installment agreement] a payment plan agreement upon the approval of the commissioner of housing preservation and development. The commissioner of housing preservation and development, in consultation with the commissioner of finance, may at the commissioner of housing preservation and development's discretion, permit a party to enter into a payment plan agreement for the payment of such taxes, assessments, and other legal charges and interest. [Where such agreement is requested before the preparation of the aforesaid in rem judgment roll is commenced, the terms of said agreement shall be consistent with the provisions of subdivision g or i of this section, whichever is applicable. Where such agreement is requested after judgment of foreclosure has been entered in the in rem action in which the aforesaid answer was interposed, said agreement shall require a first installment of fifty percent of all taxes, assessments and other legal charges and interest owing on said parcel, a penalty of five percent of all such taxes, assessments and other legal charges and interest, which penalty may not exceed one thousand dollars, and the payment of the balance of such taxes, assessments and other legal charges and interest in four equal quarterly installments together with all current taxes, assessments and other legal charges that accrue during such period. The request of an answering party for an installment agreement shall constitute a withdrawal of such party's answer. An installment] A payment plan agreement requested by an interested party other than the answering party shall require the consent of said answering party [which shall also constitute a withdrawal of such party's answer]. The severance provided for in this section shall be continued during the term of all [installment] payment plan agreements entered into pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision. Where a default has occurred as to a parcel severed pursuant to this subdivision, the corporation counsel shall cause to be entered a supplemental judgment of foreclosure as to such parcel immediately on notification by the commissioner of finance of such default. Where such [installment] payment plan agreement is paid in full, the commissioner of finance shall discontinue the in rem action from which said parcel was severed by issuing a certificate of withdrawal as to said parcel pursuant to the provisions of section 11-413 [of this chapter].\n\t2.

The answering party or interested party shall be required to remit a payment equal to not less than 30 percent of such delinquent taxes, assessments, or other legal charges, interest, and penalties, together with a sworn statement, in a form to be determined by the commissioner of finance, that the answering party or interested party has the financial ability to (i) remediate all open hazardous or immediately hazardous violations of record of the housing maintenance code; (ii) continue to maintain the property so as to prevent the existence of further hazardous or immediately hazardous conditions; and (iii) comply with the terms of the payment plan agreement. The remaining installments, which shall be twice the number of unpaid quarters or real estate taxes or the equivalent thereof but which shall in no event exceed 120 in number, shall be payable quarterly on the first day of July, October, January, and April. The answering party or interested party shall also demonstrate that not less than 75 percent of the conditions that gave rise to the immediately hazardous violations have been corrected. The answering party or interested party shall also submit a corrective action plan agreement pursuant to section 11-425,\n\t[i. (1) Notwithstanding subdivision g of this section, this subdivision shall apply with respect to installment agreements made, executed and filed with the commissioner of finance on or after the date on which this subdivision takes effect. An installment agreement pursuant to this subdivision may be made, executed and filed with such commissioner during the period beginning on the date on which an action is commenced as provided in subdivision d of section 11-405 of this chapter with respect to the parcel that is the subject of such agreement and ending on the date on which such commissioner is advised by the corporation counsel that the preparation of the judgment of foreclosure in such in rem action has been commenced. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, and except to the extent provided in paragraph two of this subdivision, the provisions of paragraphs one through six of subdivision c of section 11-405 of this chapter shall not apply to any installment agreement requested on or after the date on which this subdivision takes effect and on or after the date on which an action is commenced as provided in subdivision d of such section 11-405 with respect to the parcel that is the subject of such requested agreement.\n\t(2) An agreement entered into pursuant to this subdivision shall provide for the payment in installments of the delinquent taxes, assessments and other legal charges, and the interest and penalties thereon, due and owing as of the date on which such agreement is requested.

[Where such an agreement is entered into subsequent to the last date for redemption specified in subdivision a of section 11-407 of this chapter, there shall be paid to the commissioner of finance at the time such agreements are executed an amount equal to the penalty that would have been payable under subdivision c of section 11-407 of this chapter had the person executing the agreement made a late redemption payment. Such amount shall be in addition to any installment payments required to be made under the agreement and shall not be credited against any such installment payments.] Where a default occurs in such agreement as to either quarterly installments or current taxes, assessments, or other legal charges, all payments made under the agreement shall be [forfeited] refunded to the property owner or other interested party and the city shall be entitled to obtain a judgment hereunder as to the parcel as to which the default occurred. Where such default occurred before the submission of the judgment roll, the parcels as to which such default occurs shall be included in said judgment roll amount the parcels to be acquired by the city or by a third party. Where such default has occurred as to a parcel severed pursuant to this subdivision, the corporation counsel shall cause to be entered a supplemental judgment of foreclosure as to such parcel immediately on notification by the commissioner of finance of such default.

A defendant alleging any jurisdictional defect or invalidity in such taxes, assessments or other lawful charges or in the foreclosure thereof must particularly specify in his or her answer such jurisdictional defect or invalidity and must affirmatively establish such defense. A judgment of foreclosure granted in any proceeding brought pursuant to this chapter, which contains recitals that any acts were done or proceedings had which were necessary to give the court jurisdiction or power to grant such judgment of foreclosure, shall be presumptive evidence that such acts were duly performed or proceedings duly had, if such judgment of foreclosure shall have been duly entered or filed in the office of the clerk of the county in which the proceeding was pending and wherein such judgment was granted. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to and be valid and effective with respect to all defendants even though one or more of them be infants, incompetents, absentees or non-residents of the state of New York].\n      � 10.

In addition thereto, such judgment shall contain a direction to the commissioner of finance to prepare, execute, and cause to be recorded a deed conveying to the city full and complete title to such lands. Upon the execution of such deed, the city shall be seized of an estate in fee simple absolute in such land and all persons, including the state of New York, infants, persons judicially declared to be incapable of managing their own affairs [incompetents], absentees, and non-residents who may have had any right, title, interest, claim, lien, or equity of redemption in or upon such lands shall be barred and forever foreclosed of all such right, title, interest, claim, lien, or equity of redemption, except as otherwise provided in section 11-424 [of this chapter]. The appointment and tenure of receivers, trustees, or any other persons, including administrators under article seven-A of the real property actions and proceedings law, appointed by an order of a court to manage real property, shall terminate when title to such property vests in the city pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. After such termination, said receivers, trustees, or administrators shall be accountable to the courts that appointed them for the faithful performance of their fiduciary obligations during the term of their appointment and to the city for any rents and income received by them for any period subsequent to the date of the vesting of title in the city. [If the city serves a tenant in possession of a dwelling unit with notice of termination of tenancy on grounds other than non-payment of rent, the acceptance of rent for the first forty-five 45 days after termination of tenancy by anyone other than an employee of the department designated by the department to receive such rent shall not be deemed or construed as a waiver of the city's right to initiate and prosecute a proceeding to terminate the tenancy for good cause.]\n      c.

The commissioner shall not deem qualified any third party who has been finally adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction, within [seven] 7 years of the date on which such third party would otherwise be deemed qualified, to have violated any section of articles [one hundred fifty] 150, [one hundred seventy-five] 175, [one hundred seventy-six] 176, [one hundred eighty] 180, [one hundred eighty-five] 185, or [two hundred] 200 of the penal law or any similar laws of another jurisdiction, or who has been suspended or debarred from contracting with the city or any agency of the city pursuant to section 335 of the charter during the period of such suspension or debarment.

Following the expiration of the [four-month] 180 day period prescribed in subdivision d of this section, but not more than [eight months] 1 year after the date on which, pursuant to subdivision b of this section, the final judgment authorizing the award of possession of a parcel of class [one] 1 or class [two] 2 real property was entered, the commissioner of finance may execute a deed, pursuant to [subdivision b] paragraph 2 of this [section] subdivision, with respect to such parcel.

The appointment and tenure of receivers, trustees, or any other persons, including administrators under article seven-A of the real property actions and proceedings law, appointed by an order of a court to manage real property, shall terminate when title to such property vests in the city or a third party pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.

The commissioner of finance shall mail bills for taxes, charges, and assessments to all registered real property owners [who have filed owner's registration cards as herein provided , but the failure of the commissioner of finance so to mail such bill shall not invalidate or otherwise affect the tax, charge or assessment represented thereby nor prevent the accruing of any interest or penalty imposed for the non-payment thereof, nor prevent or stay proceedings under this chapter, nor effect the title of the plaintiff or any purchaser under such proceedings].\n      c. The commissioner of finance shall also mail notice of foreclosure and any other process required by this chapter to all owners who have filed an owner's registration [cards] whenever the parcels as to which such [cards were] registration was filed are included in a list of delinquent taxes filed pursuant to this chapter. [The failure to receive such notice or process as herein provided shall not affect the validity of any action or proceeding brought pursuant to this chapter.] Nothing within this section shall preclude the requirement that the commissioner of finance effect personal service under subdivision d of section 11-406. \n      d. An owner who files an owner's registration [card] may also designate thereon the full name and post office address of a mortgagee, lienor, or other person to receive bills and notices [Where such designation is made, the commissioner of finance shall not mail any bills and notices to the owner but shall mail all bills and notices to the owner's designee].\n      � 15. Section 11-417 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\n      � 11-417 In rem [cards] registration; mailing notices to other interested persons. a. The commissioner of finance shall, in addition to the file maintained by [him or her] said commissioner pursuant to section 11-416 [of this chapter], maintain a [file of in rem cards] database of registrations submitted by any person having an interest in real property who is not entitled to have tax bills mailed to [him or her] such person by the commissioner of finance, including mortgagees, lienors, encumbrancers, and owners who have filed an owner's registration [cards] designating someone else to receive bills and notices. Each such [in rem card] registration shall be signed by the person filing such [card] registration or a duly authorized representative[,]; shall contain a description of the premises by reference to the section, block, and lot numbers on the tax map; and shall state the date on which said [card] registration was filed, the full name and post office address of the person filing said [card] registration, and the nature of the interest said person has in said premises.\n      b. The commissioner of finance shall mail a notice of foreclosure and any other process required by this chapter to each person who has filed [an in rem card] a registration whenever the parcels to which such [cards] registrations refer are included in a list of delinquent taxes filed pursuant to this chapter. [However, failure to receive such notice or process shall not affect the validity of any proceeding brought pursuant to this chapter.]\n      � 16. Section 11-424 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 59 for the year 1996, is amended to read as follows:\n      � 11-424 Application to the city for release of property acquired by in rem tax foreclosure. a. [(1)] 1. The city's interest in property acquired by in rem tax foreclosure may be released pursuant to this section on the application of any party who had an interest in said property as either owner, mortgagee, lienor, or encumbrancer at the time of the city's acquisition thereof where such application is made at any time up to [two] 2 years from the date on which the deed by which the city acquired title to said property was recorded. \n      [(2)] 2. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of paragraph [one] 1 of this subdivision to the contrary, the city's interest in property acquired by in rem tax foreclosure may be released pursuant to this section upon application of any party who had an interest in said property as either owner, mortgagee, lienor, or encumbrancer at the time of the city's acquisition thereof where such application is made more than [two] 2 years after the date on which the deed by which the city acquired title to said property was recorded provided such application is authorized by the council as hereinafter provided. An application for such release and the documents required by subdivision c of this section in support thereof shall be filed with the department of citywide administrative services in the manner provided in subdivision b of this section. The department of citywide administrative services shall give the council written notice of the receipt of each such filing. After review and approval of the application by the corporation counsel as to form and eligibility of the applicant, the department of citywide administrative services shall send a copy of such application to the in rem foreclosure release board and to the council. Upon receipt of such application, the in rem foreclosure release board shall take no further action on such application unless the council adopts a resolution within [one hundred twenty] 120 days following the first stated meeting of the council after receipt of such application authorizing the board to consider such application. If the council fails to adopt a resolution within such [one-hundred-twenty-day] 120 day period, the council shall be deemed to have denied its authorization for the board to consider such application. A resolution of the council pursuant to this paragraph shall describe the property for which release is sought by borough, tax map, block, and lot number and shall specify that release of the city's interest in such property is subject to the approval of the in rem foreclosure release board and to all the conditions and restrictions set forth in this section.\n      b. [1.] Any such application shall be made in writing to the commissioner of citywide administrative services and shall be verified. It shall contain the name and address of the applicant and shall state the date on which and the in rem action by which the city acquired title to the property sought to be released. It shall also contain a statement specifying the nature of the applicant's interest in the property and a full description of the instrument from which the applicant's interest derives including the date of execution, the date and place of the recording or entry of said instrument, and the parties thereto. In the event the applicant's interest arises by reason of the death of a prior owner, mortgagee, lienor, or encumbrancer, then the application shall also state the applicant's relationship to said decedent and shall include whatever additional information may be necessary to prove the applicant's right to make such application. \n      [2. A fee of two hundred seventy-five dollars shall be paid on the submission of any such application which is subject to the provisions of subdivision f of this section, except that the fee for any such application for the release of property improved by a one or two-family dwelling shall be one hundred dollars. \n      3. A fee of five hundred fifty dollars shall be paid on the submission of any such application which is subject to the provisions of subdivision g of this section, except that the fee for any such application for the release of property improved by a one or two-family dwelling shall be one hundred dollars. \n      4. A fee of two hundred seventy-five dollars shall be paid on the submission of any such application which is subject to the provisions of subdivision h of this section within four months from the date on which the deed by which the city acquired title to the subject property was recorded, and a fee of five hundred and fifty dollars shall be paid on the submission of any such application which is subject to the provisions of such subdivision not within four months from such date; except that the fee for any such application which is subject to the provisions of such subdivision for the release of property improved by a one or two-family dwelling shall be one hundred dollars. \n      5. The fees payable pursuant to paragraphs two, three and four of this subdivision shall not be refundable. \n      6. In addition to the fees specified in paragraphs two, three and four of this subdivision, there shall be paid on the submission of any application which is subject to this section an amount at least equal to the lesser of nine hundred dollars or the sum specified in paragraph one of subdivision d of this section, which amount shall not be refundable, but shall be applied in reduction of the sum specified in paragraph one of subdivision d of this section; provided, however, that if a release requires the authorization of the in rem foreclosure release board, and such authorization is not given, such additional amount shall be refunded to the applicant.]\n      c. Each application shall be supported by the certified search of the city register or by an official letter, certificate, or certified search of any title insurance, or abstract company, organized and doing business under the laws of this state. Such supporting instruments shall recite the recording data both as to the deed by which the city acquired title to the parcel sought to be released and the instrument from which the applicant's interest derives. In the event the applicant's interest does not appear of record but is derived by the death of an owner, mortgagee, lienor, or encumbrancer of record, then the application shall also be supported by the affidavit of the applicant or other person having information thereof, or by the duly written certificate or certification of the county clerk or the clerk of any surrogate's or other court of record, or by any other instrument or document required by the corporation counsel to substantiate the applicant's right to file such application in compliance with the provisions of this section.\n      d. The city's interest shall be released only after payment, as to each parcel to be released, of the following sums of money: \n      1. The principal amount due on all unpaid taxes, assessments, water charges, and sewer rents appearing on the list of delinquent taxes and accruing thereafter together with interest at the rate or rates provided by law. \n      2. [Five percent of the amount paid pursuant to the preceding paragraph but not exceeding one thousand dollars for each parcel. \n      3.]  Any deficiency which may result to the city after all payments made by it for the repair, maintenance, and operation of the lands, real estate, or real property shall have been charged or debited in the appropriate accounts of the city and all rents, license fees, and other moneys collected by the city as a result of its operation of the said lands, real estate, or real property shall have been credited in such accounts. Any contract for repair, maintenance, management, or operation made by the city on which it shall be liable, although payment thereon shall not have been made, shall be deemed a charge or debit to such accounts as though payment had been made. The amounts paid and collected by the city as shown in its accounts and the necessity for making the several payments and contracts to be charged as herein provided shall be conclusive upon the applicant. Where a deficiency under this [subdivision] paragraph shall be created or increased by the failure of the city to collect rents, license fees, or other moneys to which the city may have been entitled, the right to collect or to bring action for the same shall be assigned, transferred, and set over to the applicant by an instrument in writing. \n      [4. Any and all costs and disbursements which shall have been awarded to the city or to which it may have become entitled by operation of law or which it may have paid or become liable for payment in connection with any litigation between it and the applicant or any person having an estate or interest in the lands, real estate or real property to be released resulting directly or indirectly from the foreclosure by action in rem of the delinquent taxes affecting said lands, real estate or real property. \n      5.] 3. A reasonable monthly fee to be determined by the city, through the department of citywide administrative services, for management services and operations of the lands, real estate, or real property by the city prior to the release of said lands, real estate, or property. \n      [6.] 4. The city, through the department of citywide administrative services, shall also require as additional consideration for such release, the payment of all arrears on mortgages held by the city and all liens accruing to it by operation of law including but not limited to relocation and emergency repair liens. \n      e. The corporation counsel shall effect the release of the city's interest in property acquired by in rem tax foreclosure, as provided for in this section, by preparing and causing to be entered an order discontinuing the in rem tax foreclosure action as to said property, cancelling the notice of pendency of such action as to said property, and vacating and setting aside the in rem judgment of foreclosure and the deed executed and recorded pursuant to such judgment of foreclosure as to said property. The entry of such order shall restore all parties, including owners, mortgagees, and any and all lienors, receivers and administrators, and encumbrancers, to the status they held at the time the city acquired title to said property, as if the in rem tax foreclosure had never taken place, and shall render said property liable for all taxes, deficiencies, management fees, and liens which shall accrue subsequent to those paid in order to obtain the release provided for in this section, or which were, for whatever reason, omitted from the payment made to obtain said release.\n      f. If an application pursuant to this section, and the documents required by subdivision c of this section in support thereof, are filed within [four months] 180 days after the date of the city's acquisition of the subject property, said application shall be granted [providing] provided the corporation counsel approves the application as to form, timeliness, and eligibility of the applicant and [providing] provided the applicant has paid all amounts required to be paid by subdivision d of this section within [thirty] 30 days of the date on which a letter requesting the applicant to make such payment is mailed or delivered to the applicant. The city shall not sell or assign any property acquired by in rem tax foreclosure within [four months] 180 days of said acquisition but this provision shall not prevent the city from authorizing condemnation of such property or vesting title thereto in a condemnation proceeding during said [four month] 180 day period. In the event an application pursuant to this section is filed within [four months] 180 days of the city's acquisition by in rem tax foreclosure and title to the subject property vests in condemnation before the city's interest therein has been released by the vacate order provided for herein, the applicant shall be entitled to the condemnation award for such property without the entry of such vacate order, providing the corporation counsel has approved the application as aforesaid and [providing] provided that the amounts specified in subdivision d of this section, if not previously paid, are deducted from said condemnation award, with taxes apportioned to the date of the condemnation title vesting.\n      g. If an application for a release of the city's interest in property acquired by in rem tax foreclosure, and the documents required by subdivision c of this section in support thereof, have been filed within the time allowed in paragraph [one] 1 of subdivision a of this section, but more than [four months] 180 days after the date of the city's acquisition or if an application for such release has been authorized by a resolution of the council pursuant to paragraph [two] 2 of subdivision a of this section and such application and the documents required by subdivision c of this section in support thereof have been filed, the in rem foreclosure release board may, in its discretion, authorize the release of the city's interest in said property pursuant to this section, provided that the application has been approved by the corporation counsel as to form, timeliness, and eligibility of the applicant and provided that the city has not sold or otherwise disposed of said property and provided, further, that said property has not been condemned or assigned to any agency of the city and is not the subject of contemplated use for any capital or urban renewal project of the city. The corporation counsel shall effect such discretionary release only where the applicant, after the board's authorization of the release, has paid all the amounts required to be paid by subdivision d of this section within [thirty] 30 days of the date on which a letter requesting the applicant to make such payment is mailed or delivered to the applicant. The in rem foreclosure release board may also, in its discretion, authorize a release of the city's interest in such property, pursuant to the above provisions, whenever an application for such release, approved as to form, timeliness, and eligibility by the corporation counsel, has been filed at any time during the period allowed in subdivision a of this section in which the applicant has requested [an installment] payment plan agreement of the commissioner of citywide administrative services for the payment of the amounts required to be paid by subdivision d of this section, provided that said commissioner has approved such request. The commissioner of citywide administrative services shall not approve any such request unless the applicant shall have given notice by certified mail to each tenant located on the parcel, of the request and shall have given such commissioner an affidavit stating that such notice has been provided, within [thirty] 30 days after the request. Any false statement in such affidavit shall not in any way affect the validity of the agreement, be grounds for its cancellation, or in any way affect the release of the city's interest in the parcel. Such agreement shall require, in addition to full payment of the amounts due under paragraphs [two] 2, [three] 3, [four] 4, [five] 5, and [six] 6 of subdivision d of this section, a first installment of [fifty] 20 percent of the amount due under paragraph [one] 1 of said subdivision d with the balance of said amount to be paid in [four] 4 equal quarterly installments together with all current taxes, assessments, or other legal charges that accrue during such period; provided, however, that: (i) whenever a request for [an installment] a payment plan agreement is made of the commissioner of citywide administrative services by a company organized pursuant to article XI of the private housing finance law with the consent and approval of the department of housing preservation and development, or for a parcel which is an owner-occupied residential building of not more than [five] 5 residential units, the commissioner of citywide administrative services may, as to that portion of the amounts due under paragraph [one] 1 of subdivision d of this section which became due prior to the acquisition by the article XI company of its interest in the property and as to the amount due under paragraph [one] 1 of subdivision d of this section in the case of such an owner-occupied building, approve a reduction of such first installment to an amount not less than [ten] 10 percent of the amount due under paragraph [one] 1 of subdivision d of this section and an increase in the number of the following equal quarterly installments to a number which shall be equal to [three] 3 times the number of unpaid quarters of real estate taxes or the equivalent thereof but which shall in no event exceed [forty-eight] 48, and (ii) notwithstanding the preceding clause, whenever an installment agreement is requested on or after the date on which this clause takes effect with respect to a parcel that, immediately prior to the city's acquisition thereof by in rem tax foreclosure, was owned by a company organized pursuant to article XI of the [state] private housing finance law with the consent and approval of the department of housing preservation and development, or with respect to a parcel that is a residential building containing not more than [five] 5 residential units, a residential condominium unit, or a residential building held in a cooperative form of ownership, the commissioner of [general] administrative services may, as to the amount due under paragraph [one] 1 of subdivision d of this section, approve [an installment] a payment plan agreement containing the terms relating to the required percentage payment for the first installment and the required number of subsequent quarterly installments[, that would be applicable to such parcel under paragraph two (but without regard to any reference therein to paragraph three) of subdivision i of section 11-409 of this chapter]. For purposes of calculating the number of such following equal quarterly installments, unpaid real estate taxes, or the equivalent which are[, on and after July first, nineteen hundred eighty-two,] due and payable on an other than quarterly basis shall be deemed to be payable on a quarterly basis. Where the in rem foreclosure release board denies an application requesting [an installment] a payment plan agreement, the board shall authorize a release of the city's interest, provided that the applicant thereafter pays all the amounts required to be paid by subdivision d of this section within [thirty] 30 days of the date on which a letter requesting such payment is mailed or delivered to the applicant only when said application and the documents required by subdivision c of this section in support thereof were filed within [thirty] 30 days of the date of the city's acquisition of the property sought to be released. Where the in rem foreclosure release board denies an application requesting [an installment] a payment plan agreement which was filed more than [thirty] 30 days after the date of the city's acquisition, the board may, in its discretion, authorize a release of the city's interest, provided that the applicant thereafter pays all the amounts required to be paid by subdivision d of this section within [thirty] 30 days of the date on which a letter requesting such payment is mailed or delivered to the applicant. Where the in rem foreclosure release board approves an application requesting [an installment] a payment plan agreement, the order releasing the city's interest shall provide that in the event of any default as to the payment of either quarterly installments or current taxes, assessments, or other legal charges during the term of such agreement, as set forth in the board's resolution, all payments made under said agreement shall be refunded and the city shall be entitled to reacquire the property so released. The corporation counsel shall effect such reacquisition by causing to be entered as to such property a supplemental judgment of foreclosure in the in rem action by which said property was originally acquired immediately on notification by the commissioner of finance of such default.\n      h. An owner of property entitled to an exemption under any of the provisions of article [four] 4 of the real property tax law during all or part of the period covered by the tax items appearing on a list of delinquent taxes may apply for a release of the city's interest in such exempt property under the provisions of this section during the periods of time set forth herein and for an additional period up to [ten] 10 years from the date of the city's acquisition of said property by in rem foreclosure. The application of such owner shall contain, in addition to the statements, searches, and proofs required by this section, a statement that an exemption under the real property tax law is being claimed. Such application shall also state either that it is accompanied by the written certificate of the comptroller setting forth the precise period during which said property, while owned by such applicant, and during the period after the city's acquisition up to the date of the certificate if said property was still being used for an exempt purpose after said acquisition, was entitled to an exemption and the exact nature and extent of such exemption or that an application for such written certificate has been filed with the comptroller. On issuing such written certificate, the comptroller shall cancel those tax items which have accrued during the period covered by the certificate to the extent the applicant is entitled to an exemption as set forth in the certificate. Where an application by an exempt owner is filed more than [four months] 120 days after the date of the city's acquisition of the subject property, a release of the city's interest may be issued only at the discretion of the in rem foreclosure release board and subject to all the restrictions set forth in the preceding subdivision. A release to an exempt applicant shall be effected only after said applicant has paid all the amounts required to be paid by subdivision d of this section, except for those tax items which have been cancelled, in whole or in part, pursuant to the comptroller's certificate, within [thirty] 30 days of the date on which a letter requesting payment is mailed or delivered to the applicant.\n      i. The corporation counsel shall also effect the release of the city's interest in property acquired by in rem foreclosure, as provided for in this action, whenever the commissioner of finance shall accept as to any parcel so acquired, the payment provided for in [paragraph two] item (ii) of subdivision a of section 11-413 [of this chapter]. Said commissioner may accept such payment at any time within [four months] 120 days of the date of the city's acquisition and may further, subject to the approval of the in rem foreclosure release board, accept such payment at any time more than [four months] 120 days after the date of the city's acquisition but less than [two] 2 years from the date on which the city's deed was recorded [providing] provided said property has not been sold or otherwise disposed of nor condemned or assigned to any agency of the city and is not the subject of contemplated use of any capital or urban renewal project of the city.\n\t� 17. Section 11-425 of the administrative code of the city of New York is REPEALED and a new section 11-425 is added to read as follows:\n\t� 11-425 Corrective action plans. The owner of a distressed property that has open hazardous and immediately hazardous violations shall submit to the department of housing preservation and development for approval a corrective action plan consisting of the following: (i) the names of any contractors retained by such owner to clear any outstanding hazardous or immediately hazardous violations; (ii) the date by which the condition that gave rise to the hazardous or immediately hazardous violation is expected to be remediated; and (iii) any funding obtained by such owner to clear any hazardous or immediately hazardous violations. The department of housing preservation and development shall provide approval or disapproval of the corrective action plan within 45 days of receipt of such plan. Should the department of housing preservation and development decline to approve a corrective action plan, such department may provide an explanation why the plan was not approved and may provide an option to resubmit an amended corrective action plan for approval.\n\t� 18. Section 11-426 of the administrative code of the city of New York is REPEALED and a new section 11-426 is added to read as follows:\n\t� 11-426 Defaults. a. An owner who has entered into a payment plan agreement with the department of finance or the department of environmental protection will be in default of such agreement if any installment required under such agreement remains unpaid for a period of 60 days from the date payment is required to be made. In the event of default of a payment plan agreement pursuant to this subdivision, the agreement may be canceled. Such a default may be cured upon payment, within 60 days from the date of default, of the unpaid payments, including all past due payments required by the agreement, and all other charges that became due during the term of the agreement that are past due and unpaid at the time of the default. If the default is not cured, all sums previously paid shall be returned to the owner.\n\tb. If a default is not cured as described in subdivision a of this section, the owner of the affected property will not be eligible to enter into a payment plan agreement with the department of finance or the department of environmental protection for the affected property for 3 years from the date of such default, unless the property owner can demonstrate that there were extenuating circumstances that prevented the property owner from curing the default.\n\t� 19. Section 11-427 of the administrative code of the city of New York is REPEALED and a new section 11-427 is added to read as follows:\n\t� 11-427 Tenant ownership of property. a. Tenants of a property that is subject to in rem foreclosure pursuant to this chapter shall be eligible to apply for eventual ownership of the subject property. The department of housing preservation and development shall provide written notice to the tenants of such property that the subject property is subject to an in rem judgment of foreclosure. Such notice shall include, but not be limited to: \n\t1. Information on the in rem foreclosure program; \n\t2. Information on how the tenants can apply for eventual ownership of the subject property; \n\t3. The factors the department of housing preservation and development considers in determining whether to approve the transfer to tenant ownership upon completion of the interim evaluation period as specified in subdivisions d and e of this section; \n\t4. Any relevant qualifications the tenants would need to meet in order to be eligible for eventual ownership of the subject property; and\n\t5. Resources available from third parties,  through the department of housing preservation and development, or through other city agencies for the tenants for financial, physical, technical, operational, governance, regulatory, and legal assistance in the management of such a property. \n\tb. Such notice as required in subdivision a of this section shall be provided prior to entry of the judgment of foreclosure. Such notice shall be posted in a common area of the subject property, mailed to each dwelling unit in such property, and placed beneath the doors of individual dwelling units in such property.\n\tc. The application of the tenants of the subject property shall be sponsored by a third party, as described in section 11-412.1, indicating that the third party applying for transfer of the foreclosed property is prepared to acquire, manage, and rehabilitate the foreclosed property, and is sponsoring the tenants in their effort to eventually own such property. \n\td. No later than 30 days after the transfer of the property to the third party sponsoring a tenant application, as described in subdivision c of this section, the department of housing preservation and development shall inform the tenants that the property has entered into an interim evaluation period. During such interim evaluation period, the department of housing preservation and development shall provide information on the evaluation process and any necessary steps the tenants need to take during the interim evaluation period to obtain ownership of the property. Such evaluation process shall include, but not be limited to:\n\t1. Whether the tenants have cooperated with the third party sponsor in renewing leases or establishing new leases where none exist;\n\t2. Whether at least 80 percent of the tenants are actively paying rent;\n\t3. Whether the tenants have cooperated with relocation plans, where applicable;\n\t4. Whether the tenants have attended training programs offered by the third party;\n\t5. Whether at least 80 percent of the tenants have expressed interest in eventual ownership of the property; \n\t6.

Upon completion of the interim evaluation period, the department of housing preservation and development shall make a determination whether the property will be transferred to tenant ownership. \n\tf. Properties owned by a cooperative corporation formed by a housing development fund corporation when the foreclosure proceeding commenced shall not be excluded from such application process. Where a property was owned by a housing development fund corporation organized pursuant to article XI of the private housing finance law, and such housing development fund corporation seeks to reorganize as a housing development fund corporation and regain ownership of the property, at least 80 percent of existing occupants must sign subscription agreements; be current on rent; and attend mandatory cooperative homeownership training classes on governance, regulatory compliance, and financial management to be eligible for such transfer pursuant to this section. \n\t� 20.

The balance of such proceeds, if any, and the interest on any purchase money mortgage accepted by the city at the time of such sale shall be paid [into the general fund] to the property owner who owned the property prior to the tax enforcement foreclosure proceeding.[ In the event that any part of such balance is represented by bonds and mortgages, such bonds and mortgages may be deposited in the tax appropriation and general fund stabilization reserve fund and a sum equal to the amount of the cash represented by such bonds and mortgages shall in such event be transferred from the tax appropriation and general fund stabilization reserve fund to the general fund.]\n      � 21. Section 1807 of the New York city charter is amended by adding a new subdivision d to read as follows:\n      d.
