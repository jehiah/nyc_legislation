  "Summary": "This bill would establish a six-month pilot program to evaluate food quality feedback surveys for city food service contracts valued at $1 million or more. The bill would require the Mayor to designate participating agencies to distribute standard surveys to require food service contractors to collect consumer feedback on food quality, taste, and cultural relevance. Participating agencies would need to post the survey findings on their websites within 30 days after the pilot concludes, and the Office of Food Policy would need to evaluate the program's effectiveness, making recommendations for future feedback initiatives.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      Section 1. Food quality feedback surveys. a. The office of food policy, in consultation with the department of health and mental hygiene, shall develop and make available a standardized food quality feedback survey to agencies that hold food service contracts. Such feedback survey shall include questions designed to assess consumer satisfaction regarding food quality, taste, and cultural relevance of such food. For the purposes of this section, the term \"food service contract\" means a contract between a contractor and an agency valued at $1,000,000 or more, the principal purpose of which is the preparation or serving of meals.\n      b. Beginning January 1, 2026, the mayor shall designate an agency or agencies holding a food service contract to participate in a six-month pilot program to evaluate the implementation of food quality feedback surveys. During such pilot period, such agency shall require food service contractors to collect, aggregate, and submit to such agency responses to the food quality feedback survey from consumers of food prepared or served pursuant to a food service contract. Feedback from such consumers may be submitted anonymously. Such feedback survey shall be available in paper or digital format and shall, where practicable, collect site-specific data for each location where meals are provided pursuant to a food service contract. \n      c. Each agency participating in the pilot program established pursuant to subdivision b of this section shall, no later than 30 days after the conclusion of the pilot period, post on its website a summary of the aggregate food quality feedback survey findings collected during such pilot period.\n      d. No later than 120 days after the conclusion of the pilot period, the office of food policy shall submit a summary to the mayor and the speaker of the council evaluating the effectiveness and feasibility of the pilot program and making recommendations for improving the methodology, implementation, and analysis of future food quality feedback surveys. The aggregate results of one or more such surveys shall be provided to the speaker of the council upon request.\n      ÔøΩ 2. This local law takes effect 120 days after enactment, provided that compliance with the requirements added by section one of this local law shall apply only to any food service contract registered after such enactment date, and provided further that this local law expires and is deemed repealed on the date that the office of food policy submits to the mayor and the speaker of the council the summary required by subdivision d of section one of this local law.\nSession 13\nARP/KS\nLS # 15911\n5/20/25",
