  "Summary": "This bill would establish a six-month pilot program to evaluate food quality feedback surveys for city food service contracts valued at $1 million or more. The bill would require the Mayor to designate participating agencies to distribute standard surveys to require food service contractors to collect consumer feedback on food quality, taste, and cultural relevance. Participating agencies would need to post the survey findings on their websites within 30 days after the pilot concludes, and the Office of Food Policy would need to evaluate the program's effectiveness, making recommendations for future feedback initiatives.",
