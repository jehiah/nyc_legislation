  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Citywide Administrative Services, in coordination with other relevant agencies, to install 150 megawatts of solar photovoltaic systems on the roofs of city-owned buildings and other city-owned property by the end of 2035. The department would be required to complete at least 100 megawatts worth of installations by September 1, 2030. Installations would be prioritized in disadvantaged communities, and the department would be required to set criteria for increasing the number of eligible roofs that can host solar photovoltaic systems. Additionally, the department would be required to report: (1) factors considered when making determinations about the long-term ownership, operation and maintenance of such systems, (2) the expected location and size of each system to be installed, along with an indication of whether requests for proposals have been issued for all necessary contracts, (3) information pertaining to ineligible roofs, and (4) identifying information for all city-owned properties that have had such systems installed, including but not limited to the address, system size, annual energy savings, and annual emissions reduction.",
  "TextID": 78418,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Section 4-207.1 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 24 for the year 2016, is amended to read as follows:\n      � 4-207.1 Photovoltaic systems for city-owned buildings and property. a. As used in this section:\n      City building. The term \"city building\" shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in section 28-309.2 of the code.\n      Contracted entity. The term \"contracted entity\" means a local development corporation or other not-for-profit corporation, a majority of whose members are appointed by the mayor, that contracts with the city to provide or administer economic development benefits on behalf of the city and expending city capital appropriations in connection therewith, except that such term does not include the Brooklyn navy yard development entity as defined in section 22-821.\n      Cost effective. The term \"cost effective\" means, with respect to the installation of a photovoltaic system or additional photovoltaic system capacity, one or more of the following determinations:\n      1. The cumulative savings expected to result from such installation, including expected savings in energy costs, will in 25 years or less, equal or exceed the expected costs of such installation, less all federal, state and other non-city governmental assistance available to offset the cost of such installation and including the social cost of carbon value, as described in paragraphs 3 and 4 of subdivision d of section 3-125 of the code; provided, however, that a higher site- or project-specific social cost of carbon value may be developed and used in lieu of the social cost of carbon value described in such paragraphs.\n      2. A power purchase agreement relating to such installation, entered into with the city, offers electricity rates for photovoltaic systems that meet or are lower than the average prevailing utility rates.\n      Department. The term \"department\" means the department of citywide administrative services.\n      Eligible roof. The term \"eligible roof\" means a city building roof that is less than or equal to [ten] 10 years old and in good condition, as defined by city asset management standards.\n      b. 1. By December 31, 2035, the department, in coordination with any other relevant agency, shall install, maintain, and operate photovoltaic systems with a total power capacity of at least 150 megawatts on city building roofs and other city-owned property, including but not limited to parking lots, industrial sites, and property controlled, leased, or operated by a contracted entity. \n      2. By September 1, 2030, the department, in coordination with any other relevant agency, shall install at least 100 megawatts of the photovoltaic systems required to be installed pursuant to paragraph 1 of this subdivision.   \n      c. In meeting the requirements of subdivision b of this section, the department shall prioritize the installation of photovoltaic systems in disadvantaged communities, as defined by section 75-0101 of the environmental conservation law. \n      d. The department, in coordination with any other relevant agency, shall set criteria for increasing the number of eligible roofs in order to meet the requirements of subdivision b of this section. The department shall identify such criteria and any increase in the number of eligible roofs in the report required by subdivision f of this section.\n\te. 1. By September 1, 2028, the department shall submit to the speaker of the council and the mayor, and make publicly available online, a report that identifies factors to consider when making determinations about the long-term ownership, operation, and maintenance of photovoltaic systems installed pursuant to subdivision b of this section that are the subject of power purchase agreements.\n      2. By September 1, 2030, the department shall submit to the speaker of the council and the mayor, and make publicly available online, a report (i) identifying the expected location and size, expressed in total power capacity (in kilowatts), of each photovoltaic system to be installed pursuant to subdivision b of this section that has not been installed as of September 1, 2030, and (ii) indicating whether a request for proposals has been issued for all contracts necessary to install such photovoltaic systems, and, if so, providing a planned timeline, including a planned date of completion, for all work to be performed pursuant to such contracts.   \n      f. By December 31, 2016, and by September 1 of every second year thereafter, the department, with the cooperation of all appropriate city agencies, shall submit to the speaker of the council and the mayor, and make publicly available online, a report containing, at a minimum, the following information for each city building, disaggregated by council district:\n      1. The street address of such building;\n      2. The age of such building's roof;\n      3. Whether such building's roof is in good condition, as defined by city asset management standards;\n      4. The following information for 100 unique roofs that are not eligible roofs and for which such information has not been included in any prior report: the estimated photovoltaic system size that could be installed on each such roof, as expressed in installed power capacity (in kilowatts), if such roof were repaired or replaced so as to become an eligible roof;\n      5.
