An employer shall make such written policy readily available to employees by, at a minimum, conspicuously posting such policy at an employer's place of business in an area accessible to employees and electronically on such employer's intranet, if one exists. The policy shall include a statement that employees have a right to request a lactation room, and identify a process by which employees may request a lactation room. This process shall:\n      (1) Specify the means by which an employee may submit a request for a lactation room;\n      (2) Require that the employer respond to a request for a lactation room within a reasonable amount of time not to exceed five business days;\n      (3) Provide a procedure to follow when two or more individuals need to use the lactation room at the same time, including contact information for any follow up required;\n      (4) State that the employer shall provide [reasonable break time for an employee] 30 minutes of paid break time, and shall further permit an employee to use existing paid break time or meal time for time in excess of 30 minutes to express breast milk pursuant to section 206-c of the labor law; and\n      (5) State that if the request for a lactation room poses an undue hardship on the employer, the employer shall engage in a cooperative dialogue, as required by subdivision 28 of this section. \n      (ii) The commission shall, in collaboration with the department of health and mental hygiene, develop a model lactation room accommodation policy that conforms to the requirements of this subdivision and a model lactation room request form.
