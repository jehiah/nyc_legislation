  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Education (DOE) to report annually information on school librarians and library access in DOE schools. The DOE would be required to report, for each school, the number of licensed and non-licensed school librarians; the number of students in grades 7 and 8 who have weekly scheduled class time with school librarians; and the average amount of time students spend in such classes. The DOE would also be required to report on the number and hours of operation of school libraries, including hours open to all students; the number of students at each school; and, for secondary schools with part-time licensed school librarians, whether the hours assigned comply with state minimum staffing requirements based on school enrollment.",
