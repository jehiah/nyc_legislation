  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation (DOT) to install at least 35 electric bicycle (e-bike) battery stations in commercial corridors each year for a five-year period, and at least 25% of those would be installed in the street next to the curb and allow for e-bikes to be parked and secured. DOT would also be required to report on the installation and operation of the battery stations and post the locations of the battery stations on its website.",
