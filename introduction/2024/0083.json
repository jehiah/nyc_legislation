  "Summary": "This bill would require the Administration for Children’s Services (ACS), in consultation with the Department of Investigations and experts in child safety and child welfare, to create an action plan to implement best practices related to the maximum number of cases a child protective specialist can manage to improve child safety and wellbeing outcomes. The action plan would be published on ACS’ website and submitted to the Speaker of the City Council by September 30, 2019. ACS would report to the Speaker and make public every two years the efforts undertaken to implement the action plan.",
