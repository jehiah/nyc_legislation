  "Summary": "This bill would require the Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) to conduct a study on the challenges and opportunities related to increasing the use of electric for-hire vehicles and installing new charging infrastructure. TLC would also be required to include, in their annual utilization report, data on electric for-hire vehicles, the infrastructure necessary to support them, incentive programs, and overall progress towards the electrification of the for-hire vehicle fleet.",

An estimate of the total number of publicly available electric vehicle charging stations required to support a transition of all licensed for-hire vehicles to electric vehicles; \n      b. An evaluation of the impact of charging on the number of rides for-hire vehicle drivers can provide and the income of those drivers; and\n      c. An analysis of potential incentive programs designed to encourage the adoption of electric for-hire vehicles, including the issuance of for-hire vehicle licenses when internal combustion engine for-hire vehicles are replaced by electric for-hire vehicles. \n      � 2.

The estimated costs of an electric vehicle compared to the costs of an internal combustion engine vehicle, such as vehicle acquisition, rental costs, fuel, and maintenance; \n      7. Whether existing and projected charging capacity meets or is expected to meet the demand for existing and projected electric for-hire vehicles, including an analysis of trends in the utilization of existing chargers, based on information available to the commission;\n      8. Recommended locations for additional electric vehicle charging stations based on the residences and trip patterns of for-hire vehicle drivers; \n      9.
