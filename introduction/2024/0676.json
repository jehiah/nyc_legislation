An estimate of the total number of publicly available electric vehicle charging stations required to support a transition of all licensed for-hire vehicles to electric vehicles; \n      b. An evaluation of the impact of charging on the number of rides for-hire vehicle drivers can provide and the income of those drivers; and\n      c. An analysis of potential incentive programs designed to encourage the adoption of electric for-hire vehicles, including the issuance of for-hire vehicle licenses when internal combustion engine for-hire vehicles are replaced by electric for-hire vehicles. \n      � 2.
