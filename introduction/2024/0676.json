  "Summary": "This bill would require the Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) to conduct a study on the costs, challenges, and opportunities related to increasing the use of electric for-hire vehicles and installing new charging infrastructure and to report on the findings of the study, including recommendations for incentive programs to encourage the use of electric for-hire vehicles and recommended locations for new electric vehicle charging stations. The bill would also require the TLC to set targets for issuance of licenses to electric vehicles and installation of charging infrastructure and report twice a year on progress towards those targets.",

Such report shall include, but need not be limited to: \n      1. An estimate of the total number of electric vehicle charging stations required to transition all licensed for-hire vehicles to electric vehicles; \n      2. How the availability of overnight charging impacts the number of rides for-hire vehicle drivers can provide and the income of drivers; \n      3.

Recommended locations for additional electric vehicle charging stations based on the residences of for-hire vehicle drivers; \n      5. An analysis of the cost and feasibility of installing electric vehicle charging stations in the locations that the taxi and limousine commission recommends; \n      6.

The average fuel and maintenance costs of an electric for-hire vehicle over the average time period that an electric vehicle is used as a for-hire vehicle compared to the average fuel and maintenance costs of an internal combustion engine for-hire vehicle over the average time period that an internal combustion engine vehicle is used as a for-hire vehicle; \n      8. The average weekly and monthly cost for a for-hire vehicle driver to rent a for-hire electric vehicle licensed by the taxi and limousine commission compared to the weekly and monthly cost to rent a licensed for-hire internal combustion vehicle; and\n      9.
