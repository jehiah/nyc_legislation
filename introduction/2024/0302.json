  "Summary": "Pursuant to section 10-119 of the administrative code, it is unlawful to post advertisements, handbills or other such postings on sidewalks, public poles and other street furniture, as well as automobiles parked on public roads. Section 10-121 lists the penalties for such unlawful posting. For a first offense, the penalty includes a fine of not less than $75 nor more than $150. For every subsequent offence within a 12 month period, the fine is not less than $150 nor more than $250. This bill would raise the maximum fine for a second offense of illegal posting from $250 to $1,000.",
