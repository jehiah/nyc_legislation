These professionals and candidates would facilitate student discussions and workshops on various mental health topics. The bill would require the Commissioner to make best efforts to coordinate with the Chancellor of New York City Public Schools to establish this program within the clubs. Additionally, the bill would require the Commissioner, in coordination with the Chancellor, to submit to the Mayor and Speaker of the Council and post online a report on the program.",
