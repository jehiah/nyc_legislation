  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Legislative findings. The council has reviewed the application of both criminal and civil penalties in enforcing street vending offenses for purposes of efficiency, equity and fairness. The street vendor advisory board, established pursuant to local law number 18 for the year 2021, was tasked with examining and making recommendations regarding the city's vending laws. One recommendation by the board, was to remove the misdemeanor criminal penalties in � 17-325 and � 20-472 of the administrative code for mobile food vendors and general vendors, respectively. Based upon this recommendation, as well as hearing testimony and discussions with relevant stakeholders, the council intends to address concerns with the use of criminal enforcement for vending offenses, as well as serious and unintended consequences of charging a vendor with a misdemeanor. The council finds that a significant portion of individuals engaged in street vending are members of marginalized communities, for whom a criminal penalty can result in a consequence that is disproportionate to the underlying offense. \n      � 2. Paragraph 2 of subdivision a of section 17-317 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 15 for the year 1995, is amended to read as follows:\n      2. the applicant, licensee, permittee, its officers, directors, shareholders, members, managers or employees have been found [guilty of] to have committed four or more violations of this subchapter or any rules promulgated pursuant thereto within a two-year period or have been found guilty of a violation of the provisions of part fourteen of the state sanitary code or of the New York city health code, or the applicant, licensee, permittee, its officers, directors, shareholders, members, managers or employees have pending any unanswered summonses for violation of this subchapter or any rules promulgated pursuant thereto.\n      � 3.
