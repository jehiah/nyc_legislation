  "Summary": "This bill would direct the Department of Environmental Protection, with assistance from the Fire Department, and any other relevant agency, to conduct study to determine locations within the city that experience the highest levels of siren noise, the most common times for siren noise and propose mitigation measures for reducing siren noise impact. The bill would also require DEP to establish a toll-free telephone number and web page to facilitate the centralized collection of complaints about siren noise during the study period. The DEP would then be required to submit a report to the Speaker of the Council and the Mayor with the results of this study.",
