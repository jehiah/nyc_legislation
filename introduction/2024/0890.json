  "Summary": "This bill would require the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene to implement a three-year pilot program to establish postpartum support groups focused on the mental health of individuals who are up to 1 year postpartum. There would need to be at least one group established in each borough, at least one group established in each of the three community districts with the highest rates of postpartum mental health issues, and at least one group established in each of the three community districts with the highest risk factors for social determinants of poor mental health. The Commissioner would have to create informational materials about the program, to be provided to hospitals and other healthcare providers for dissemination to postpartum individuals. The Commissioner would be required to submit to the Mayor and Speaker of the Council, and post online, a report on the program, in part including recommendations on whether to establish a permanent postpartum support group program.",
