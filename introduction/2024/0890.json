  "Summary": "This bill would require the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene to implement a three-year pilot program to establish postpartum support groups focused on the mental health of postpartum individuals. The support groups would be professionally facilitated and provide access to peer support, educational materials on postpartum mental health and postpartum stressors, and resources on home visiting support, lactation consultants, and other maternal health experts. There would need to be at least one group established in each borough, at least one group established in each of the three community districts with the highest rates of postpartum mental health issues, and at least one group established in each of the three community districts facing the greatest community and geographic impacts due to factors such as structural racism, high poverty rates, limited access to healthcare services, and social determinants of poor mental health. The Commissioner would be required to submit to the Mayor and Speaker of the Council, and post online, a report on the program, in part including recommendations on whether to establish a permanent postpartum support group program.",
