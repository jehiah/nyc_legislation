  "Summary": "This bill would require the Commissioner for the Aging to conduct a three-year study on Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities (NORCs) and Neighborhood Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities (N-NORCs) in New York City. The study would identify potential NORCs and N-NORCs, assess the needs of older adults, evaluate necessary improvements, and collect data on demographic trends and health outcomes. Within two years of completing the study, the Commissioner would be required to develop and implement a plan to support aging in place within these communities. This plan would include recommendations for officially designating identified communities, resource estimates for supportive service programs, training for community-based organizations, infrastructure improvements, and the establishment of a program to provide grant funding and other resources to support the operations of community-based organizations to provide services within such identified communities.",
