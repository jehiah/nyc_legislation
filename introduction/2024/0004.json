  "Summary": "This bill would alter the terms of the contract between the city and NYCEDC (“EDC”) by requiring EDC to compel cruise terminal operators to require cruise ships with shore power capability to connect to shore power systems when docked, whenever shore power is available, and it is safe and practicable to do so. EDC would also be required to create and regularly update community traffic mitigation plans in the neighborhoods around each terminal in consultation with the Department of Transportation, the Police Department and neighborhood representatives.",

The term \"cruise terminal operator\" means an entity that operates, manages and maintains a cruise terminal pursuant to an agreement with the city or a contracted entity.\n      Shore power. The term \"shore power\" means the provision of electrical power from the shore that a vessel at berth can access, thereby allowing the engine of such vessel to shut down.\n      � 2. Subchapter 2 of chapter 8 of title 22 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 22-827 to read as follows:\n      � 22-827 Shore power usage at cruise terminals.\n      a.
