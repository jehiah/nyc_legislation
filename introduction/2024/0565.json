  "Summary": "This bill would require the Campaign Finance Board, in consultation with the Board of Elections and the Office to End Domestic and Gender–Based Violence (ENDGBV), to develop guidance on the procedures under the New York State Election Law for making a voter record confidential and for voting by special ballot. In addition, the bill would require ENDGBV to distribute such guidance to Family Justice Centers, and to provide survivors with information on how to get assistance in preparing and submitting written statements to the Board of Elections to make their voter records confidential or establish their eligibility to vote by special ballot. ENDGBV would also be required to collaborate with other city agencies to distribute such guidance.",
