  "Summary": "This bill would require the inspecting entity of a periodic gas piping inspection be either a licensed master plumber or a licensed journeyman plumber working under the direct supervision of a licensed master plumber. This bill would also amend the scope of gas piping inspections, requiring inspections to include the point of connection with gas appliances, and would change the definition of ordinary plumbing work to include the replacement of gas furnaces, household gas appliances, and gas appliance connectors. This bill would also amend certain requirements for the plumbing industry. Specifically, this bill would: i) reinstate the plumbing and fire suppression license board, ii) amend the definition of emergency work to allow the repair of a plumbing system to protect the public from an unsafe condition or restore water to a building or dwelling unit; and iii) expand the Department of Building’s ability to seize equipment used for unlicensed work.",
