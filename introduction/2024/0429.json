  "Summary": "This bill would amend the gas piping inspections, entities inspecting active gas systems, the scope of inspections, and the reporting and correcting of conditions outlined in the periodic inspections of gas piping systems. Additionally, it would change the definition of ordinary plumbing work to include the replacement of household gas appliances, and other revisions. This bill would also reinstate the plumbing and fire suppression license board and amend the definition of emergency work to include work to restore the system to good and working condition without a permit when done to correct an emergency condition. This bill would remove the exception of plumbing work from the definition of fire suppression piping work and expand the Department of Buildings’ power to seize tools and vehicles when it suspects there is unlicensed or unregistered work occurring. Finally, this bill would amend the definition of piping systems to include appliance connections rather than the outlet of the shutoff valve.",
