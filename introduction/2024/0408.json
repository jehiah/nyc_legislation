The Division would have to recommend SBS programs that street vendors be permitted to access and the removal or adjustment of administrative requirements for SBS programs to the Commissioner. The Commissioner would be required to update SBS programs based on the Division’s recommendations unless doing so would be prohibited by law or would not be consistent with the purposes of the programs. The Division would also be required to offer training and education and to conduct outreach to street vendors. Further, the Commissioner would be required to annually submit to the Speaker and the Mayor, and publish on the SBS website, a report on the updating of SBS programs based on the Division’s recommendations and a report on the Division’s assistance of street vendors.",
