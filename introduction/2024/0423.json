If the report contains recommendations for the department or correctional health services, the department or correctional health services shall respond to each recommendation and indicate whether and how it will implement each such recommendation. If the department or correctional health services determines that it does not intend to implement a recommendation, the department or correctional health services shall provide the reasons for such determination.\n      k.

If the department or correctional health services determines that it does not intend to implement the recommendation, the department or correctional health services shall provide the reasons for such determination. The department and correctional health services shall update the board of correction 6 months after responding to the recommendations pursuant to this subdivision and every 6 months thereafter on progress made towards implementing each recommendation until each recommendation is fully implemented.\n      l. No later than 30 days after the board of correction publishes the final report on the death of an individual in custody pursuant to paragraph 2 of subdivision i of section 626 of the charter, the commissioner shall submit to the mayor and the speaker of the council and shall post conspicuously on the department's website a report regarding the status of employees of the department identified in the board of correction's final report as being involved in the circumstances that contributed to the individual's death.
