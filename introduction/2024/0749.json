  "Summary": "This bill would create an Office of Residential Displacement Remediation within NYC Emergency Management (NYCEM). The Office would function as a central support to City residents who have been displaced from their homes following a residential fire or other natural disaster. The Office would also provide information to displaced residents about required agency inspections and vacate orders, if applicable, and would function in an oversight capacity by monitoring agencies relevant to the disaster recovery process. Specifically, the Office would ensure agency compliance with procedures around necessary inspections, vacate orders (if applicable), and deadlines to ensure that displaced individuals are placed back in their residences in a timely manner. This bill would also create an online portal on the NYCEM website for displaced residents and building owners to receive information on post residential fire and natural disaster relief and status updates on relevant agency inspections and orders. Finally, this bill would provide status notifications to the community board, borough president, and council member representing the district where the residential fire or natural disaster occurred.",
