  "Summary": "This bill would require the mayor to designate an agency or office to provide centralized support to residents displaced by a fire, natural disaster, or other emergency impacting a residential building. The designated agency or office would be required to serve as a point of contact for displaced residents by responding to inquiries and requests for assistance, and by facilitating communication between residents and relevant agencies. When an agency determines that it is safe to reoccupy a building from which residents were displaced, the designated agency or office must attempt to notify such residents, as well as the relevant community board and elected officials.",
