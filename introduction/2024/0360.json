  "Summary": "This bill would prohibit brokers from passing their fee onto tenants where the broker is exclusively representing the landlord’s interests. This would include brokers who publish listings with the landlord’s permission. Landlords or their agents would be required to disclose the fees that the tenant must pay in their listings and rental agreements. The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection would enforce this bill and would conduct education and outreach. Any person who violates this bill would be subject to a civil penalty or civil action.",
