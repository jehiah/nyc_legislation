  "Summary": "This bill would require the Commissioner of Transportation, in consultation with the Department of Small Business Services and the New York City Economic Development Corporation, to study and report on the feasibility of siting additional ferry terminals in New York City. The study would identify potential locations for additional ferry terminals and would consider the local benefits of each new siting, logistical challenges associated with each new siting, any solutions to these challenges, and the estimated costs associated with each siting. The Commissioner of Transportation would be required to submit a report containing the findings of the study to the Mayor and Speaker of the Council, and post a copy of the report on the Department of Transportation website.",
