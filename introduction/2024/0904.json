  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Buildings to create a risk-based inspection program to identify hazardous buildings, using a predictive model to weigh factors including but not limited to building data, violation history, and prior façade inspection reports. The department shall conduct proactive inspections after the model assigns a risk score indicating the likelihood of a structural collapse. The owner of a building that receives a notice of violation as a result of the risk-based inspection program shall submit and post a corrective action plan within 10 days, and shall be precluded from receiving any non-emergency permits until all façade defects are corrected. Violations issued as a result of the risk-based inspection program shall be corrected within 30 days. The department shall impose escalating penalties for any violation centered on an unsafe condition that was present during the prior façade inspection program cycle.",

The model shall, at minimum, weigh the following factors: \n1. building data, including the building's age, occupancy type, ownership type, construction material, number of floors from the ground level, number of public-facing exposures, and number of inhabitants; \n2. permit history and the date of the most recent alteration;\n3. violation history;\n4. current and prior critical examination reports; \n5. qualified exterior wall inspector certification history; \n6. prior maintenance records; \n7. number of 311 complaints; and, \n8. any other factors set by rule of the commissioner. \n      \n      � 2.

The corrective action plan shall be prepared by a registered design professional. The plan shall clearly document each structural defect and shall include a timeline detailing repairs to make the building safe. Such report must be signed and sealed by such registered design professional. The department shall conduct follow-up inspections every 60 days, to verify the progress of the corrective measures outlined in the corrective action plan. The owner of a building must distribute the corrective action plan to the inhabitants of the building, made available in all designated citywide languages.    \n      \n      \n      � 3. Article 302 of title 28 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 126 of the year 2022, is amended to add new section 28-302.7.2 to read as follows:\n      � 28-302.7.2 Timeframe to correct violations.
