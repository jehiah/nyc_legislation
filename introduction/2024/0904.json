  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Buildings to create a risk-based inspection program to identify hazardous buildings, using a predictive model to weigh factors including but not limited to building data, violation history, and prior façade inspection reports. The department shall conduct proactive inspections after the model assigns a risk score indicating the likelihood of a structural collapse. The owner of a building that receives a notice of violation as a result of the risk-based inspection program shall submit and post a corrective action plan within 10 days, and shall be precluded from receiving any non-emergency permits until all façade defects are corrected. Violations issued as a result of the risk-based inspection program shall be corrected within 30 days. The department shall impose escalating penalties for any violation centered on an unsafe condition that was present during the prior façade inspection program cycle.",

The commissioner shall establish a proactive inspection program to identify buildings where unlicensed or unpermitted work may be occurring, or where maintenance issues, fa�ade or structural issues, or other issues of concern could affect the integrity of a building or neighboring site. The department shall use predictive analytics to weigh the factors identified in items 1 through 8 of this section that may indicate potential safety or other issues. The department shall evaluate such factors and conduct inspections at buildings where such evaluation indicates there is a potential for a hazardous condition or other safety concern. Such program shall consider the following factors: \n\n1. building information and characteristics, including but not limited to building age, occupancy type, ownership type, and construction material; \n2. permit history;\n3. violation history;\n4. applicable compliance filings; \n5. disciplinary history of registered design professionals, contractors, or licensees; \n6. relevant 311 complaints; \n7. neighboring site characteristics and construction activity; and\n8. any other factors determined by the commissioner. \n      \n� 28-326.2 Corrective action plan.

When a corrective action plan is required by the commissioner, the owner or the owner's agent shall submit a corrective action plan acceptable to the department within the time set forth by the department, but not more than 30 days after the date the owner or owner's agent was notified of such requirement.
