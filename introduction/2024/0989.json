  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to create student wellness club toolkits to help guide middle and high school students on how to create peer-led student wellness clubs. Such toolkits would include informational materials on youth mental health, best practices for facilitating group discussions on mental health, guidance for mental health promoting activities, as well as a link to the Department of Education (DOE) website describing the process for starting a student club. The bill would also require DOE to post on its website guidance on how to start a student club at school and make the student wellness club toolkits created by DOHMH available to all middle and high school students. Finally, the bill would require DOE to issue an annual report including information regarding the dissemination of such toolkits and relevant information regarding all student wellness clubs in the city.",
