  "Summary": "This bill would void as contrary to public policy no-rehire provisions in settlement agreements under New York City’s human rights law. Existing no-rehire provisions would expire after five years. Agreements to end existing agency or employment relationships would still be permitted. Employers would also be permitted to terminate or refuse to rehire for non-discriminatory or non-retaliatory reasons.",
