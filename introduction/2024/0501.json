  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to consult with the Department of Education (DOE) when completing background checks for current or prospective child care providers, employees, and volunteers. Upon receiving a request for a background check, DOHMH would be required to consult with DOE to determine whether DOE has already completed a background check for the individual within the previous two years. If so, DOHMH would be required to request any relevant information obtained through the DOE background check required to satisfy the requirements for a background check conducted by DOHMH. DOHMH would remain required to complete any additional searches and obtain any additional information for an individual needed to satisfy the requirements for the agency’s background checks pursuant to any federal or state laws, rules or regulations, before clearing an individual for work as a child care provider or employee.",
