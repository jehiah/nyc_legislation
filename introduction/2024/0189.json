  "Summary": "This bill would specify that the Department of Parks and Recreation (Parks) may only issue a permit to remove a city-owned tree if the permit application provides the name of the certified arborist who will remove the tree. It would also specify that it is unlawful for anyone other than the certified arborist to conduct the tree removal. Finally, Parks would be required to report annually on city-owned trees removed in the previous year, including the location of removed trees, whether Parks has replaced removed trees, whether permitted removals were supervised by Parks employees, and, for illegal removals, whether anyone has been held liable.",
