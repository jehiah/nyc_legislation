  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation (“DOT”) to coordinate with other impacted agencies or public utility companies when performing resurfacing work. It would also require DOT to complete resurfacing work within 15 business days after the completion of milling work, where practicable. If the work cannot be done within that time, DOT would be required to post a notice on its website and provide email notice to the affected community board explaining the reason additional time is needed and the new expected date of completion. The coordination requirement and 15 business day timeline comes into effect 60 days after this bill becomes law, while the notice requirement comes into effect 2 years after this bill becomes law.",
