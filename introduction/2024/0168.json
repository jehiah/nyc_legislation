  "Summary": "The Public Oversight of Surveillance Technology (POST) Act was enacted by City Council in 2020 and requires the New York City Police Department (NYPD) to evaluate and report on surveillance technologies used by the Department. This legislation would add new provisions to the law which would require that the NYPD, upon request, provide the Department of Investigation (DOI) with an itemized list of all surveillance technologies currently used by the Department, and provide information on all data access and retention policies for data collected by such technologies. In addition, the legislation requires that the NYPD provide DOI with semiannual updates on all newly acquired or discontinued surveillance technologies and updates to any data access and retention policies established in recently executed contracts for surveillance technologies.",
