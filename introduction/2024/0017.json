  "Summary": "This bill would require owners of parking garages and open parking lots with 10 or more spaces that are licensed by the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP”) to install Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (“EVSE”) in 20% of parking spots and ensure 40% of parking spots are capable of supporting EVSE by January 1, 2035. This bill would allow for adjustments or waivers to this requirement under outlined circumstances, such as structural infeasibility. For parking garages and open parking lots not licensed by DCWP, various agencies would be required to conduct a study and issue a report no later than two years after the effective date of this local law to recommend the required level of EVSE installation. The Department of Buildings (“DOB”) would be required to promulgate rules to implement requirements for parking garages and open parking lots not licensed by DCWP by January 1, 2027. Finally, the bill would require DOB to annually report on the installation of EVSE.",
