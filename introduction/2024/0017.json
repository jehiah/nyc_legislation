  "Summary": "This bill would require owners of parking garages and open parking lots with 10 or more spaces that are licensed by the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP”) to install Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (“EVSE”) in 20% of parking spots and ensure 40% of parking spots are capable of supporting EVSE by January 1, 2035. This bill would allow for adjustments or waivers to this requirement under outlined circumstances, such as structural infeasibility. For parking garages and open parking lots not licensed by DCWP, various agencies would be required to conduct a study and issue a report by March 31, 2025 to recommend the required level of EVSE installation. The Department of Buildings (“DOB”) would be required to promulgate rules to implement requirements for parking garages and open parking lots not licensed by DCWP by January 1, 2027. Finally, the bill would require DOB to annually report on the installation of EVSE.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      Section 1.  Exception 18 of section 28-101.4.3 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 126 for the year 2021, is amended to read as follows:\n18. Parking garages and open parking lots. [Where an alteration of a parking garage or an open parking lot includes an increase in the size of the electric service such alteration shall include  provisions for the installation of electric vehicle charging stations in accordance] Parking garages and open parking lots shall comply with section  406.4.10 or 406.9.8 of the New York city building code, as applicable. \n\n      � 2. Article 315 of chapter 3 of title 28 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 28-315.12 to read as follows:\n� 28-315.12 Electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE). Parking garages and open parking lots shall be capable of supporting and equipped with EVSE as set forth in sections 28-315.12.1 and 28-315.12.2, and in accordance with the New York city electrical code.\n\n� 28-315.12.1 EVSE requirements for department of consumer and worker protecton licensed parking garages and open parking lots. Parking garages and open parking lots with 10 or more parking spaces that are required to be licensed by the department of consumer and worker protection or successor agency in accordance with section 20-321 shall ensure that no less than 20 percent of parking spaces in existing parking garages and open parking lots shall be equipped with level 2 charging stations and 40 percent of parking spaces be capable of supporting level 2 charging stations by January 1, 2035. For purposes of compliance with this section, the installation of 1 direct current fast charging station shall be considered to be the equivalent of 10 level 2 charging stations, provided the installation of direct current fast charging stations shall not be used to satisfy more than 50 percent of the level 2 charging stations required. Owners of such parking garages and open parking lots shall submit a report of compliance with this section to the department within 60 days after final inspection of such installation in a form and manner specified by the department.\n\nExceptions. The commissioner may grant an adjustment to or waiver of any of the provisions of this section with respect to a parking garage or open parking lot where: \n\n1. The project costs exceed the baseline costs for EVSE installation as determined by the department in accordance with recommendations of the department of transportation, and the owner is complying with the requirements of this section to the maximum extent practicable and has availed itself of all available federal, state, city, private, and utility incentive programs related to EVSE for which it reasonably could participate;\n\n2. The owner demonstrates that the provisions of this section would create an undue hardship as a result of limitations of the local utility provider;\n\n3. For parking garages or open parking lots that utilize equipment that enables vehicles to be parked vertically and the owner demonstrates that such vertical parking would make the use of EVSE unsafe, an adjustment may be granted so that only spaces where EVSE could be safely used will be calculated for purposes of determining requirements under this section; \n\n4. The owner demonstrates that compliance with this section would compromise the structural integrity of the parking structure; or\n\n5. The owner demonstrates that compliance with this section is not feasible for other reasons as established by the department rule.\n\n� 28-315.12.2 EVSE requirements for unlicensed parking garages and open parking lots. Parking garages and open parking lots with 10 or more spaces that are not required to be licensed by the department of consumer and worker protection or successor agency shall be equipped with EVSE and be capable of supporting EVSE in accordance with a schedule established by the department by rule. Such schedule shall be based on recommendations of the department of transportation pursuant to the study published by such department pursuant to section 5 of the local law that added this section and may include such exceptions as the commissioner determines to be appropriate or necessary, including the exceptions set forth in section 28-315.12.1. No later than January 1, 2027, the department shall promulgate rules as required to implement this section.\n\n� 28-315.12.3 Annual EVSE installation report.

An EVSE with a minimum charging capacity of 50 kw.\n\nELECTRIC VEHICLE LOAD MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. An electronic system designed to allocate charging capacity among EVSE.\n\nELECTRIC VEHICLE SUPPLY EQUIPMENT (EVSE). See Article 625.2 of the New York City Electrical Code.\n\nLEVEL 2 CHARGING STATION. An EVSE with a minimum charging capacity of 6 kw.\n      \n      � 4. Sections 406.2, 406.4.10, and 406.9.8 of the New York city building code, as renumbered and amended by local law number 126 for the year 2021, are amended to read as follows:\n406.2 Definitions.

At least 60 percent of the parking spaces of the garage shall be capable of supporting EVSE. The installation of 1 direct current fast charging station shall be considered the equivalent of 10 level 2 charging stations, and the installation of direct current fast charging stations shall not be used to satisfy more than 50 percent of the level 2 charging stations required for purposes of compliance with this section. This amount of electrical capacity may be coupled with an electric vehicle load management system to distribute power to a greater percentage of spaces at lower amperage as EVSE penetration increases above 40 percent of parking spaces. [The electrical room supplying the garage must have the physical space for an electrical supply panel sufficient to provide 3.1 kW of electrical capacity to at least 20 percent of the parking spaces of the garage. Such raceway and all] All components and work appurtenant thereto, including ventilation system(s), shall be in accordance with the New York City Electrical Code and the New York City Mechanical Code. \n\nExceptions: 1.

At least 60 percent of the parking spaces of the lot shall be capable of supporting EVSE. The installation of 1 direct current fast charging station shall be considered the equivalent of 10 level 2 charging stations, and the installation of direct current fast charging stations shall not be used to satisfy more than 50 percent of the level 2 charging stations required for purposes of compliance with this section. This amount of electrical capacity may be coupled with an electric vehicle load management system to distribute power to a greater percentage of spaces at lower amperage as EVSE penetration increases above 40 percent of parking spaces. [electrical raceway shall be capable of providing a minimum supply of 11.5 kVA to an EVSE from an electrical supply panel. The raceway shall be no smaller than 1 inch. The electrical supply panel serving such parking spaces must have at least 3.1 kW of available capacity for each stall connected to it with raceway. Such raceway and all] All components and work appurtenant thereto, including ventilation system(s), shall be in accordance with the New York City Electrical Code and the New York City Mechanical Code. \n\n      Exceptions:\n      \n1.
