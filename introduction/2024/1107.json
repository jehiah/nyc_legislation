  "Summary": "This bill would create a new definition for “adult” in the Building Code and Housing Maintenance Code, to define the term as an individual eighteen years of age or older. This bill would also amend the definition of “family” in the Building Code and Housing Maintenance Code to increase the number of permissible boarders, roomers, and lodgers from two to four adults. Additionally, this bill would allow a permanent occupant who receives registration pursuant to the short-term rental registration law to offer a short-term rental to up to four guests and their children.",
