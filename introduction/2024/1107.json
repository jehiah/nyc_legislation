Any building or structure designed and occupied exclusively for residence purposes on a long-term basis for more than a month at a time by not more than [one] 1 family. One-family dwelling shall also be deemed to include a dwelling located in a series of one-family dwellings each of which faces or is accessible to a legal street or public thoroughfare, provided that each such dwelling unit is equipped as a separate dwelling unit with all essential services, and also provided that each such unit is arranged so that it may be approved as a legal one-family dwelling. The permanent occupant or occupants of a one-family dwelling unit who receives a registration pursuant to Section 26-3102 of the Administrative Code shall provide reasonable access to the dwelling unit to the boarders, roomers, or lodgers, but shall not be required to provide access to the bedrooms, offices, or other similar private spaces of any permanent occupant in the dwelling unit.\n\n\t� 2. The definition of \"DWELLING, TWO-FAMILY\" set forth in section 202 of the New York city building code, as added by local law number 126 for the year 2021, is amended to read as follows:\nDWELLING, TWO-FAMILY. Any building or structure designed and occupied [exclusively] primarily for residence purposes on a long-term basis for more than a month at a time by not more than [two] 2 families. Two-family dwellings shall also be deemed to include a dwelling located in a series of two-family dwellings each of which faces or is accessible to a legal street or public thoroughfare, provided that each such dwelling is equipped as a separate dwelling with all essential services, and also provided that each such dwelling is arranged so that it may be approved as a legal two-family dwelling. The permanent occupant or occupants of a dwelling unit in a two-family dwelling who receives a registration pursuant to Section 26-3102 of the Administrative Code shall provide reasonable access to the dwelling unit to the boarders, roomers, or lodgers, but shall not be required to provide access to the bedrooms, offices, or other similar private spaces of any permanent occupant in the dwelling unit.\n\n\t� 3. The definition of \"FAMILY\" set forth in section 202 of the New York city building code, as added by local law number 126 for the year 2021, is amended to read as follows:\nFAMILY.\n\n1. A single person occupying a dwelling unit and maintaining a common household with not more than [two] 2 boarders, roomers, or lodgers;\n\n2. \tTwo or more persons related by blood, adoption, legal guardianship, marriage, or domestic partnership; occupying a dwelling unit and maintaining a common household with not more than [two] 2 boarders, roomers, or lodgers;\n\n3.\tNot more than [three] 3 unrelated persons occupying a dwelling unit and maintaining a common household;\n\n4.\tNot more than [three] 3 unrelated persons occupying a dwelling unit in a congregate housing or shared living arrangement and maintaining a common household;\n\n5.\tMembers of a group home;\n\n6.\tFoster children placed in accordance with provisions of the New York State Social Services Law, their foster parent(s), and other persons related to the foster parents by blood, marriage, or domestic partnership; where all residents occupy and maintain a common household with not more than [two] 2 boarders, roomers, or lodgers; or\n\n7.\tUp to [seven] 7 unrelated students enrolled at a single accredited college or university occupying a student apartment and maintaining a common household pursuant to a lease, sublease, or occupancy agreement directly with such college or university, provided that:\n\n7.1.\tThe entire structure in which the dwelling unit is located is fully sprinklered in accordance with Chapter 9 of this code;\n\n7.2.\tSuch occupancy does not exceed the maximums contained in Section 27-2075(a) of the New York City Housing Maintenance Code;\n\n7.3.\tPrior to commencement of such occupancy, and on an annual basis thereafter such college or university has submitted a fire safety plan containing fire safety and evacuation procedures for such dwelling unit that is acceptable to the Fire Commissioner and in compliance with any rules promulgated by the Fire Commissioner; and\n\n7.4.\tThe dwelling unit complies with additional occupancy and construction requirements as may be established by rule by the Housing Preservation and Development Commissioner. \n\nA common household is deemed to exist if all [household] family members have access to all parts of the dwelling unit.
