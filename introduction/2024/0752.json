  "Summary": "This bill would allow the Commissioner of Consumer and Worker Protection to refuse to renew, suspend, or revoke a tobacco retailer dealer license upon a finding that the holder of such license violated subdivision 1 of section 125 of the Cannabis Law through the distribution for sale, selling at wholesale or retail, or delivering to consumers of any cannabis, cannabis product, medical cannabis, or cannabinoid hemp or hemp extract product without the appropriate registration, license, or permit issued by New York State. This bill would also require the Commissioner of Consumer and Worker Protection to conduct an education and outreach campaign to inform affected licensees of the new grounds added by this local law for refusal to renew, suspension, or revocation of a license.",
