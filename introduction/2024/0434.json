Review treatment program, retest water within 3-7 days.\nSubsequent test results must be interpreted in accordance with this Table until level 1 is reached. For Legionella results at this level, notify Department within 24 hours of receiving test result.\n      h. Recordkeeping. An owner of a covered building shall keep and maintain records of all inspections and tests performed pursuant to this section for at least three years. Such owner shall maintain a copy of the management program and plan required by this section on the premises of the covered building. Such records and plan shall be made available to the department immediately upon request. \n      i. Reporting. An owner shall submit a report containing all information required by this section in a manner and format determined by the department on an annual basis which shall be submitted no later than January 31 of the year following the year subject to the report. The department may require any submission required by section 17-194.2 be submitted electronically. \n      j. Enforcement. 1. Department investigation. The department is authorized to investigate any covered building subject to section 17-194.2 whether it is based on a complaint or through random audit. The department may enter the premise of such building subject to investigation without prior notice to the building owner to enforce the provisions of section 17-194.2, and review and obtain a copy of any records or plan required to be kept under this section, for compliance with the requirements of this section or any rules promulgated thereunder.\n      2. Civil penalties. Any owner subject to the provisions of section 17-194.2 found in violation shall be fined in an amount determined by the department but shall not be less than $500 for the first violation and $1,000 for the second violation and $5,000 for each subsequent violation.\n      3. Environmental control board. A notice of violation served for civil penalties pursuant to this section shall be returnable at the environmental control board or any tribunal established within the office of administrative trials and hearings.\n      k. Transparency. 1. Department transparency. The department shall post conspicuously on its website in a clear, detailed manner the procedure which the department follows when investigating a legionella cluster, which shall include, but not be limited to, the threshold and criteria that triggers such investigation, the steps taken by the department to investigate and identify the cluster, the public outreach conducted by the department, the results of such investigation, and the steps taken by the department to rectify the outbreak. The department shall post conspicuously on its website the detailed information regarding the cluster identified, including, but not limited to, the geographical area identified as well as the potential source and potential health effects of legionnaires' disease and pontiac fever to at-risk populations. If a source has been identified, the department shall post the estimated length of time that the level of legionella bacteria may remain elevated in or could be an infection risk from that source. \n      l.
