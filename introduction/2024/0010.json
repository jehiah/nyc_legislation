Upon completion of the pilot program, the commissioners would be required to submit a report making recommendations on whether to expand or make the program permanent and identifying any challenges and issues presented by the pilot program. Lastly, the pilot program and report would not be required if the fire commissioner determines that the drinking fountains would interfere with the fire department’s use of fire hydrants and submits a report explaining such determination.",
