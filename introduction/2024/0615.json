  "Summary": "This bill would set the maximum working hours that an employer may assign to a home care aide. Assigned hours would be limited to 12 hours for any shift, or within any 24-hours period. A home care aide could be assigned additional hours in the event of an emergency, but no more than 2 per day or 10 per week. Additionally, a home care aide could be assigned more than 56 hours in a week provided that the employer provides 2 weeks advanced notice and obtains written consent from the home care aide. This bill would also impose a notice requirement, under which employers would be required to provide home care aides with a copy of a form notice of rights.",
