The owner of a building where a person was found to intentionally violate or assist in the violation of any of the provisions of section 26-521 may cure such violations for the purposes of this section and on the records of the department with a written agreement in which the owner commits to engage in or provide for new low income housing as such term is defined in section 27-2093.1 through an entity identified by the department as capable of developing such housing in the same community district as the building in which the unlawful eviction occurred. Such new low income housing shall be within the building in which the unlawful eviction occurred, in a new building at the same site as the building in which the unlawful eviction occurred, or in a building within the same community district, in accordance with rules promulgated by the department, provided that such owner shall construct or provide no less than the greater of: (i) 25 percent of the total residential floor area of such  building  in which the unlawful eviction occurred, or (ii) 20 percent of the total floor area of any separate building.
