  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation (DOT) to establish a pilot program to allow for-hire vehicles to park in commercial parking meter areas. The pilot program would have a 1-year duration, but could be extended by an additional 180 days if DOT determines that such an extension would promote the public interest. DOT would also be required to submit a report on the effects of the pilot program.",
