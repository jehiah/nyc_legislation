  "Summary": "This bill would require the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene to develop and offer to public middle and high school students a peer-to-peer mental health training program. The program would teach students how to identify and assist peers who are experiencing mental health issues, basic mental health concepts and how to maintain personal mental wellbeing, and about opportunities to access mental health resources. Additionally, the bill would require the Commissioner, in coordination with the Chancellor of New York City Public Schools, to submit an annual report on this program to the Mayor and Speaker of the Council and post this report online. Finally, the Department of Education would have to distribute informational materials concerning this program to public middle and high schools each academic year for distribution to students.",
