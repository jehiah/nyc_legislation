  "Summary": "This bill would require the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene to offer to public middle and high school students a peer-based mental health literacy training. The training would include instruction on identifying common signs and symptoms of mental health and substance use challenges, interacting with peers experiencing mental health distress, and locating and accessing mental health resources. Additionally, the bill would require the Commissioner, in coordination with the Chancellor of New York City Public Schools, to submit a report on this training to the Mayor and Speaker of the Council and post this report online. Finally, the Department of Education would have to distribute informational materials concerning the availability of this training to public middle and high schools each academic year for distribution to students.",
