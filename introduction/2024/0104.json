  "Summary": "This bill would require the Fire Department (“FDNY”) to confer with local affected firehouses and submit to the Department of Transportation (“DOT”) certain information, before DOT approves Open Street applications or implements major transportation projects, including bicycle lane projects. The required information would include: the local firehouses that provided feedback, the feedback provided, the method by which they provided feedback, and the date such feedback was provided. This bill would also require DOT to consult with FDNY prior to approving Open Street applications, which is already required for major transportation projects. DOT would also be required to provide, in their notice to community boards and local elected officials, the information provided by FDNY pursuant to this local law.",
