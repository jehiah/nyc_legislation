  "Summary": "This bill would require owners of most parking garages to refuse to park any vehicle on a level of such garage when doing so would cause the collective weight of vehicles on that level to exceed its maximum permissible weight limit. Each such garage would be required to install a motor vehicle weigh station so that an entering vehicle could be weighed before determining if parking such vehicle is feasible. Moreover, commercially licensed parking garages would be required to display information regarding the maximum permissible weight limits on levels within such garages and to notify the public when no further vehicles may be parked without the weight limit on each level being exceeded.",

Subdivision b of section 20-324 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\n      b. Each such licensee shall post conspicuously at the public entrance to the garage or parking lot a sign composed of letters and figures of such size, height, width, spacing, color and description as shall be prescribed by the rules and regulations of the commissioner. Such sign shall set forth the schedule of rates charged, the hours during which such garage or parking lot will remain open for business, [and] the maximum capacity by number of motor vehicles of such garage or parking lot, and, for any garage, the maximum permissible weight limit which may be permitted on each level of the garage, as determined according to section 28-323.10. \n      � 2. Section 20-327 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\n      a.

A motor vehicle shall not be accepted by a licensee for parking, or storage, if no level within the parking garage is available on which parking or storing such vehicle would not exceed the maximum permissible weight limit for that level, as calculated according to section 28-323.10. Whenever no additional motor vehicles may be parked or stored on any level of a garage without the maximum permissible weight limit being exceeded on any such level, the licensee shall post, at the public entrance thereof, a sign, composed of letters of such size, height, width, spacing, color, and description as shall be prescribed by the rules and regulations of the commissioner, stating that the maximum capacity by weight has been reached.\n      c.
