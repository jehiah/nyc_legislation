  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to establish a letter grading system, similar to the one used for restaurants, for sanitary conditions of school cafeterias and kitchens. The Department of Education (DOE) would be required to post letter grades in a publicly visible location near the front entrances and cafeteria entrances of schools, and to post inspection results and letter grades of school cafeterias and kitchens on its website. DOE would also be required to inform parents and legal guardians of school children that such information is available on the website, and to inform parents and guardians of the school cafeteria’s letter grade on no less than an annual basis and promptly inform parents and legal guardians whenever a letter grade of C or below is issued.",
