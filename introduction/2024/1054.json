  "Summary": "This bill would require the Commissioner for the Aging (“the Commissioner”), in consultation with cooperating agencies, to submit a 10-year aging in place plan to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council, and to post the plan on the Department for the Aging’s (“the Department”) website. The aging in place plan would focus on assisting older adults with aging in place throughout New York City, including in naturally occurring retirement communities and neighborhood naturally occurring retirement communities, and would include proposed projects and recommendations. The Commissioner would be required to submit the aging in place plan no later than 1 year after the effective date of the local law that enacted the plan. Two years after the publication of the aging in place plan and every two years until the plan’s completion, the Commissioner would be required to post on the Department’s website and to submit to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council a progress report detailing the status of projects and recommendations that were included in the 10-year plan.",
