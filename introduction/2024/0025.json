  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) to provide an application form for the senior citizen rent increase exemption (SCRIE) program to eligible residents in city-aided limited profit housing company developments with all applicable data electronically populated in such application form for such resident. After residents submit their annual income affidavits to HPD, the bill would require HPD to digitize the data contained in the affidavits and use such data to populate SCRIE application forms for residents that appear to be eligible for SCRIE. The populated form would be provided to potentially eligible residents along with a letter explaining the features of the SCRIE program and information on how to review the application form and apply for the program.",
