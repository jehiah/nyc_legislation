  "Summary": "This bill would require housing developers of certain housing development projects that receive city financial assistance to pay their workers a minimum combined wage and essential benefits package of at least $40 per hour with no less than $25 of that package being wages. It would also require such developers to engage in best efforts to ensure that at least 30 percent of the hours worked on the project are worked by residents of a zip code where at least 15% of the population is below the federal poverty rate or residents of a New York City Housing Authority development. This bill would require a public database and annual reporting on its requirements. This bill would require the comptroller to enforce its requirements as well as provide for a private right of action for aggrieved workers.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Title 26 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new chapter 36 to read as follows: \n      CHAPTER 36\n      COMMUNITY HIRING AND COMPENSATION STANDARDS ON CITY ASSISTED HOUSING DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS\n      � 26-3601 Definitions.

The term \"department\" means the department of housing preservation and development.\n      Developer. The term \"developer\" means an individual, sole proprietorship, partnership, joint venture, corporation, or other entity that receives city financial assistance for a housing development project.\n      Essential benefits. The term \"essential benefits\" means payments made by a construction employer other than wages that directly benefit the construction worker, including medical or dental insurance, retirement accounts, and annuities.\n      Housing development project. The term \"housing development project\" means construction or demolition of any residential building, residential facility, or residential structure, including any commercial and community components of such building, facility, or structure (1) that creates or preserves at least 100 or more dwelling units with project construction costs of three million dollars or more; and (2) that is funded in whole or in part by city financial assistance. \n      Manual labor. The term \"manual labor\" means the type of physical work the performance of which classifies a natural person as a \"manual worker\" in accordance with section 190 of the labor law and the rules and regulations adopted thereunder. \n      Target population.

The term \"wage\" means gross earnings paid to construction workers for labor or services rendered that are taxed under the Federal Insurance Contribution Act, but not inclusive of essential benefits or other supplemental benefits paid on behalf of construction workers.\n      � 26-3602 Community hiring. a. Each developer receiving city financial assistance on a housing development project shall make a best faith effort to ensure that no less than 30 percent of the hours worked by construction workers on such housing development project are worked by construction workers from the target population.\n      b. Prior to receiving city financial assistance for a housing development project, the developer shall submit to the comptroller a hiring plan describing how the developer plans to recruit construction workers to meet the hiring goals as described in this chapter.\n      � 26-3603 Wage requirements. a. No construction employer shall pay a construction worker on a housing development project less than $40 per hour in combined wages and essential benefits with the exception of construction workers who are participants in a New York State-certified apprenticeship program.\n      b. Essential benefits shall be paid to or on behalf of construction workers, but no less than $25 per hour of the combined minimum wage and benefit package shall be paid in wages.\n      c. In addition to wage notifications under subdivisions 1 and 2 of section 195 of the labor law, construction employers must provide in writing, to each construction worker, an explanation of all essential benefits that will be paid on behalf of the construction worker when such construction worker starts work on a housing development project. A new notification shall be issued to a construction worker if there is a change to the essential benefits being paid on such construction worker's behalf.\n      d. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to supersede any federal or state statute or regulation requiring construction workers earn in excess of the wages and essential benefits established in this section.\n      e. On December 31, 2025, and annually thereafter, the comptroller shall post a new combined wage and essential benefit amount for construction workers on housing development projects. Such amount shall be based on the current combined wage and essential benefit amount for construction workers on housing development projects increased by a percentage determined by the comptroller with the result rounded to the nearest 5 cents. The wage portion of the combined wage and essential benefit amount for construction workers on housing development projects may not be calculated at less than sixty-two and one half percent of the combined wage and essential benefit amount for construction workers on housing development projects. The annual percentage increase determined by the comptroller pursuant to this section shall be calculated by the comptroller by increasing the combined wage and essential benefit amount for construction workers on housing development projects by the rate of inflation for the most recent 12 month period, ending in June of that calendar year, based on the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers for the New York-New Jersey-Pennsylvania metropolitan area (CPI-W), or a successor index as calculated by the United States department of labor;\n      f. In the event the index utilized by the comptroller to calculate the combined wage and essential benefit amount for construction workers on housing development projects reflects a negative annual increase, the combined wage and essential benefit amount for construction workers on housing development projects shall not decrease.\n      � 26-3604 Reporting requirements. a. The department shall maintain a publicly searchable database available online of all construction projects subject to this chapter. Projects shall be added to such database as often as needed to keep it current, but no less than quarterly. The database shall include but not be limited to: \n      1. The address, and any proposed addresses, of the housing development project;\n      2. The type and amount of city financial assistance related to the housing development project awarded to a developer;\n      3. The name and address of each developer that is receiving city financial assistance related to the housing development project;\n      4. The agency with primary project oversight of the housing development project; and \n      5. A copy of the developer's community hire plan.\n      b. For each housing development project, each developer shall report to the department, and the department shall publish on its website no less than quarterly, the following information:\n      1. The name and address of each construction employer, or any other entity that employs construction workers, on the housing development project;\n      2. The number of construction workers employed on the construction project; and,\n      3. The number of construction work hours worked on the construction project, disaggregated by those hours worked by the categories of workers described in the target population.\n      c. For each housing development project with a project value of thirty million dollars or more, each developer shall additionally report to the department, and the department shall publish on its website no less than quarterly, the following information:\n      1. The number of construction work hours worked on the housing development project, disaggregated by those hours worked by the categories of workers described in the target population, the overall percentage of construction hours worked by the categories of workers described in the target population, the percentage of construction hours worked by the categories of workers described in the target population for each construction employer; and \n      2. The number of hours worked on a housing development project, disaggregated by workers' compensation classification code.\n      c. By December 31 of each year, the department shall submit to the speaker of the council, and make public online, a report on the status of covered housing development projects and the enforcement of this chapter. The report shall include details on enforcement actions taken by the department, or a city economic development entity, disaggregated by housing development project, developer, and construction employer, including any violations issued, findings, settlements, and penalties.\n      � 26-3605 Notice posting, recordkeeping, and retaliation. a. No later than the day on which work begins at a site subject to the requirements of this chapter, the construction employer shall post in a prominent and accessible place at every such work site and provide each employee a copy of a written notice, prepared by the comptroller, detailing the wages, benefits, and other protections to which employees are entitled under this chapter. Such notice shall also provide the name, address and telephone number of the comptroller and a statement advising employees that if they have been paid less than the combined wage and essential benefits amount they may notify the comptroller and request an investigation. Such notices shall be provided in all of the designated citywide languages. The comptroller shall make publicly available sample written notices explaining the rights of employees and covered employers' obligations under this chapter.\n      b. Each construction employer shall maintain original payroll records for each of its employees reflecting the days and hours worked, and the wages paid and benefits provided for such hours worked, and shall retain such records for no less than 6 years after the work is performed. No later than the end of each fiscal quarter, as determined by the comptroller, a construction employer shall provide a certified original payroll record reflecting the days and hours worked, and the wages paid and benefits provided for such hours worked by each construction worker on a housing development project in the manner of electronic recording determined by the comptroller. A failure to maintain or provide such records as required shall create a rebuttable presumption that the covered employer did not pay its employees the wages and benefits required under this section. Upon the request of the comptroller or the city, the covered employer shall provide within 5 days such documents, subscribed and sworn to or affirmed by him or her as true under the penalties of perjury, as may be deemed necessary to adequately enforce the provisions of this chapter, including, but not limited to, notices required under subdivisions 1 and 2 of section 195 of the labor law or copies of the notification of essential benefits required by this chapter. Any person who willfully fails to file such records with the comptroller within the time specified in this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of $1,000 per day.\n      c. It shall be unlawful for any construction employer to retaliate, discharge, demote, suspend, take adverse employment action in the terms and conditions of employment or otherwise discriminate against any employee for reporting or asserting a violation of this chapter, for seeking or communicating information regarding rights conferred by this chapter, for exercising any other rights protected under this chapter, or for participating in any investigatory, administrative, or court proceeding relating to this chapter. This protection shall also apply to any employee or his or her representative who in good faith alleges a violation of this chapter. Taking adverse employment action against an employee or his or her representative within 60 days of the employee engaging in any of the aforementioned activities shall raise a rebuttable presumption of having done so in retaliation for those activities. Any employee subjected to any action that violates this paragraph may pursue administrative remedies or bring a civil action as authorized pursuant to this chapter in a court of competent jurisdiction.\n      � 26-3606 Enforcement. a. The comptroller shall monitor compliance with the requirements of this chapter. Whenever the comptroller has reason to believe there has been a violation of this chapter, or upon a complaint in writing from a construction worker or their representative claiming a violation of this chapter, the comptroller shall conduct an investigation to determine the facts relating thereto. In conducting such investigation, the comptroller shall have the same investigatory, hearing, and other powers as are conferred on the comptroller by sections 234 and 235 of the labor law. \n      b. At the start of an investigation conducted pursuant to this section, the comptroller may, in a manner consistent with the withholding procedures established by subdivision 2 of section 235 of the labor law, request that the department or city economic development entity, or any other relevant agency, withhold any payment due to the developer or construction employer in order to safeguard the rights of the employees.\n      c. At the conclusion of an investigation commenced pursuant to this chapter, the comptroller shall offer the employer or employers that are subject of the investigation, with notice to the developer or recipient of city financial assistance on a housing development project on which the employer or employers performed work, no less than 30 days to cure the investigation via a stipulation of settlement. The comptroller may negotiate an agreed-upon stipulation of settlement or conduct a hearing concerning the alleged violation of this section. At least 10 days before the hearing, the comptroller shall give notice thereof together with a copy of the complaint, or a statement of the facts disclosed upon investigation, which notice shall be served personally or by mail on any person, developer, or construction employer affected thereby, or electronically, where such person, developer, or construction employer has consented. Such person, developer, or construction employer shall have the opportunity to be heard at the hearing regarding such matters. \n      d. Based upon the hearing record, the comptroller shall provide a report and recommendation concerning the alleged violation of this section to the mayor or mayor's designee, who shall issue an order with a final determination. Such order may: \n      1. Direct payment of one- and one-half times the wages and/or the monetary equivalent of benefits wrongly denied; \n      2. Direct the filing or disclosure of any records that were not filed or made available to the public as required by this chapter;\n      3. Direct the reinstatement of, or other appropriate relief for, any person found to have been subject to retaliation or discrimination in violation of this chapter;\n      4. Direct payment of a further sum as a civil penalty in an amount not exceeding 25 percent of the total amount found to be due in violation of this chapter; and\n      5.
