  "Summary": "This bill would require the Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) and the New York City Police Department (NYPD) to report on cases that were referred to the CCRB, but were deemed outside its jurisdiction. The bill would require that the CCRB report to the mayor and council information pertaining to cases outside their jurisdiction, including information on the type of allegation, borough of occurrence, precinct of occurrence, the reason that the incident is deemed outside the CCRB’s jurisdiction, the number of referrals made by CCRB to external agencies, and the types of agencies referred to. The NYPD would be required to report on how many and what types of cases are referred to them, the disposition of these referrals, and how long it took for a final disposition to occur. The NYPD would also be required to contact the complainant via mail or email, and would provide them a reference number and contact information to allow the complainant to follow-up on the status of their case.",
