  "Summary": "This bill would require that the Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR), with the Department of Education (DOE), post information on its website on how to access DOE indoor basketball courts when the weather does not allow for the use of outdoor basketball courts. The bill would also require DPR, with DOE to conduct a study on how to improve overall access to indoor basketball courts on days when the weather does not allow for the use of outdoor basketball courts. The study would evaluate how to improve the efficiency of the permitting process for indoor basketball courts and the feasibility of allowing members of the public to use DOE indoor basketball courts on days when the weather does not allow outdoor basketball courts use during times when school is not in session.",
