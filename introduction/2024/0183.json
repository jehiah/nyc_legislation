  "Summary": "Currently, some building owners are required to file with the Department of Buildings energy efficiency reports every 10 years and building emissions reports by May 1 of each year. This bill would allow those building owners to submit both reports as a single consolidated report in the years when the energy efficiency reports are due.",
