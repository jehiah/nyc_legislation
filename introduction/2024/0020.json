  "Summary": "This bill would require the delivery worker bicycle safety course developed by the Department of Transportation (DOT) to cover the safe and lawful operation of powered bicycles, as well as lithium-ion battery and charging safety. Each bicycle operator operating a bicycle for a business would take such course prior to making deliveries on behalf of such business.\r\n\r\nBusinesses that use bicycles for commercial purposes and are also licensed by the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) as a third-party food delivery service would be required to comply with the commercial bicycle safety laws as a condition of their DCWP license. A third-party food delivery service could have their license suspended or revoked for failing to provide bicycle safety equipment, identification or retro-reflective apparel to their delivery workers.",
