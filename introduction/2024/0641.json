  "Summary": "This bill would require that at least two meals on restaurant’s children’s menus meet certain nutrition standards and direct the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to develop regulations regarding the identification and promotion of the meals that comply with those standards. This bill would also remove flavored milk as a beverage that can be offered with a children’s meal at a restaurant and would reduce the serving size of juice offered with a children’s meal in a restaurant.",
