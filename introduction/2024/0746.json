  "Summary": "This bill would require the Commissioner of Transportation, Commissioner of Parks and Recreation, and Commissioner of Environmental Protection to modify vacant paved medians to accommodate the planting of vegetation or the use of the median in stormwater management, unless the commissioners determine that modifying a vacant paved median would not be feasible.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Subchapter 1 of chapter 1 of title 19 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 19-159.8 to read as follows: \n      � 19-159.8 Improvement of paved medians. a. Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the term \"paved median\" means a median without planted vegetation or stormwater management infrastructure. \n      b. The commissioner, in collaboration with the commissioner of parks and recreation and the commissioner of environmental protection, shall improve paved medians by planting vegetation or adding stormwater management infrastructure. Improvements shall be made at a minimum of 3 miles of paved medians per borough per year until all paved medians have been improved.\n      c. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision b of this section, the commissioner is not required to improve paved medians where the commissioner, in consultation with the commissioner of parks and recreation and the commissioner of environmental protection, determines that it is unfeasible to do so. In making such feasibility determination the commissioner shall consider public safety, the suitability of the median for the growth of vegetation, the suitability of the median for managing stormwater, the potential impact on underground infrastructure, aesthetic impact, and other factors deemed appropriate by the commissioner. \n      d. One year after the effective date of the local law that added this section, and every year thereafter until the improvement of all paved medians deemed feasible, the commissioner shall submit to the speaker of the council and post on the department's website a report regarding the length and location of paved medians improved as required under this section in the preceding year. \n      � 2.
