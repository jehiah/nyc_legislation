  "Summary": "This bill would require Department of Parks and Recreation (Parks) to place surveillance cameras in at least 10 city parks where there are frequent complaints of illegal all-terrain vehicle or dirtbike usage or where the commissioner otherwise has reason to believe that damage to park property may occur as a result of such usage. Within a year of the law’s enactment, Parks must report to the mayor and the Council on the effectiveness of the program, whether more resources are needed to deter illegal vehicle use in parks, and whether a permanent program would benefit from greater coordination with other city departments.",
