  "Summary": "This bill would prohibit nighttime illumination of the exterior or interior of any building whose main use or dominant occupancy is classified in group B or M pursuant to the New York City building code. Small stores are exempted and certain landmarked buildings may apply for a waiver of this requirement. Where a building owner has made a showing of special circumstances indicating a need for night security lighting the department may vary or waive the requirements of this section. Buildings may remain illuminated where individuals remain inside and where nighttime illumination is required by law, rule or zoning resolution. Seasonal displays may be illuminated until midnight and storefront displays are permitted limited illumination until midnight.",
