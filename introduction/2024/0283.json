  "Summary": "This bill would require the Commissioner of Small Business Services (Commissioner of SBS), in consultation with the Police Commissioner, to create a pilot program involving installation of security measures, such as security cameras and plexiglass, in certain small businesses located in zip codes with high rates of crimes associated with retail theft as determined by the Police Commissioner citywide. This bill would also require the Commissioner of SBS to develop an enrollment application and designate an enrollment period for the program. Additionally, this bill would require the Commissioner of SBS to develop an outreach campaign regarding the program utilizing the Department of Small Business Services’ website, flyers, and radio. Following the 1-year pilot program, the Commissioner of SBS would be required to submit a report to the Mayor and the Council on, in part, the cost of the program, the types of security measures installed, and the impact of the program on crime rates.",
