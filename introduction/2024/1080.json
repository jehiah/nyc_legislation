  "Summary": "This bill would require the Police Commissioner to establish a program to integrate licensed mental health professionals into 911 call centers, or public service answering points (PSAPs). The Police Commissioner would have to staff these professionals at each PSAP in New York City and provide them and 911 operators with training on the handling of 911 callers experiencing mental health crises. These professionals would provide feedback to 911 operators during 911 calls and provide emotional support and guidance to 911 callers experiencing mental health crises. The Police Commissioner would also have to issue to the Mayor and Speaker of the Council, and post online, a report on this program, including the numbers and types of mental health professionals involved, the number of 911 calls involving mental health crises that were handled and how they were handled, and a statement of any challenges encountered during implementation.",
