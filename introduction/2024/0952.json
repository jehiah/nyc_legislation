  "Summary": "This bill would require the Campaign Finance Board (CFB) to promulgate rules that require candidates to respond to disclosure statement reviews and determine the due date for those responses. The CFB would also establish a threshold number of outstanding potential violations that a candidate is permitted while remaining eligible for public matching funds.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Paragraph (b) of subdivision 12 of section 3-703 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 128 for the year 2019, is amended to read as follows:   \n \t(b) (i) The board shall review each disclosure report timely submitted by a candidate prior to the last date upon which such candidate may file a certification pursuant to paragraph (c) of subdivision one of this section, or subdivision one of section 3-717, and issue to the candidate a review within 30 days of the date upon which such disclosure report was due, provided a candidate may agree to an extension of time for such review by the board. Any response from the candidate to such review shall be due [no earlier than when] by the date on which the next disclosure report is due, or by such other date as the board may establish by rule, whichever is earlier. Such review shall inform the candidate of relevant questions the board has concerning the candidate's: [(i)] (A) compliance with requirements of this chapter and of the rules issued by the board; and [(ii)] (B) qualification for receiving public funds pursuant to this chapter. In the course of this review, the board shall give candidates an opportunity to respond to and correct potential violations, before the deadline for filing a certification pursuant to paragraph (c) of subdivision one of this section, or subdivision one of section 3-717, and give candidates an opportunity to address questions the board has concerning their matchable contribution claims or other issues concerning eligibility for receiving public funds pursuant to this chapter; provided, however, this paragraph shall not apply to the last required disclosure report before the deadline for filing a certification pursuant to paragraph (c) of subdivision one of this section or subdivision one of section 3-717. Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude the board from subsequently reviewing such disclosure reports and taking any action otherwise authorized under this chapter, provided that the board shall not invalidate a matchable contribution claim in a subsequent review unless the board learns of new information that is relevant to the eligibility for matching of such contribution claim and that was not available to the board at the time of the initial review.\n \t(ii) The board shall promulgate rules relating to responses from candidates to reviews of disclosure reports required by this paragraph. Such rules may establish a deadline for submitting such responses and a limit on the number of potential violations in such reports to which a candidate may fail to respond while remaining eligible for matching funds; provided that, where a candidate, who the board has determined is ineligible for matching funds for failing to respond to a number of potential violations that exceeds any such limit, provides responses such that the number of potential violations does not exceed such limit, the board may determine that such candidate shall be eligible for matching funds.  \n      � 2.
