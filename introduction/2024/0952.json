  "Summary": "This bill would require the Campaign Finance Board (the Board) to verify contributions to election campaigns directly with contributors when any contribution or contributions from any one contributor are, in the aggregate, greater than $50 and were made through an intermediary or through means that require contribution cards. Such contributions would not be eligible for public funds matching until they have been verified by the Board, unless they are reported close in time to the election date. A candidate who failed to respond within 30 days to requests for information from the Board relating to specific contributions, intermediaries, or possible intermediaries would lose eligibility for public matching of contributions.",

A candidate or a candidate's principal committee or authorized committee shall provide information pertaining to specific contributions, intermediaries, or possible intermediaries within 30 days of a request by the board. For contributions submitted in support of a claim for matching funds, the following records shall be maintained by a candidate and his or her principal or authorized committee:\n      (i) for a contribution by cash, a contribution card containing the contributor's name, telephone number or e-mail address, and residential address and the amount of the contribution;\n \t(ii) for a contribution by money order, a copy of the money order, provided that a contribution card containing the contributor's name, telephone number or e-mail address, and residential address shall be required if such information is not printed upon such money order by the issuing institution;\n \t(iii) for a contribution by check, a copy of the check, made out to the principal or authorized committee, provided that a contribution card containing the contributor's name, telephone number or e-mail address, and residential address from the contributor demonstrating an intent to contribute shall be required if such check is signed by a person other than the contributor;\n \t(iv) for a contribution by credit card, text message contribution or other contribution from a payment account, a record from the merchant, processor or vendor containing the contributor's name, residential address, telephone number or e-mail address, the amount of the contribution and an indicator showing that the contribution was charged to the contributor's account and processed.

For verification-required contributions that are matched prior to verification, the board shall make reasonable efforts to verify, as soon as practicable, that the purported contributor did make the verification-required contribution, and via the purported intermediary, if applicable, and was not reimbursed for that contribution. \n      � 4. Section 3-711 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new subdivision 5 to read as follows:\n      5.
