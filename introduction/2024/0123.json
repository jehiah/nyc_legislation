  "Summary": "This bill would preclude the Department of Homeless Services (DHS) from requiring that every member of a family be present at its intake center when that family seeks placement at a shelter. Currently, DHS requires that children under the age of 21 be present with their adult family members at the facility that processes shelter applications. This bill would allow these families to complete the application process without disrupting children’s schooling or other daily activities.",
