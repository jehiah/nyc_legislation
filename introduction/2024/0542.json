  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation (DOT) to issue a traffic study determination within 60 days of a request by a city council member or a community board for a traffic control device. Under the current law, council members and community boards whose requests for a traffic control device are denied are entitled to certain supporting documents underlying the determination but not to any particular timeline for completion of the study and determination. This amendment will speed up the current process overall by requiring this category of determinations to be issued within 60 days.",
