  "Summary": "This bill would require that businesses providing or offering massage in a fixed location (“massage therapy businesses”) have a license to operate. Massage therapy businesses would be required to post the license in the location where they operate. Massage therapy businesses would be prohibited from employing or retaining any person to provide massage unless that person has a state license to practice massage therapy or is exempt from the requirement to have such a license pursuant to state law and would be required to retain records for each person providing massage that show the person is licensed or exempt. Any person in violation of these requirements would be liable for civil penalties.",
