  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Buildings (“DOB”) to complete a study evaluating the frequency of the Façade Inspection and Safety Program (“FISP”) and deliver recommendations concerning the inspection schedule to the Council by December 31, 2025. This bill would also eliminate the existing 5-year FISP cycle, and require DOB to adopt new rules establishing a longer interval of time between FISP cycles, provided that such periodic intervals are between 6 to 12 years. Additionally, this bill would replace the existing requirement that the initial façade examination for any new building be conducted in the fifth year following the erection or installation of any exterior wall or appurtenance with a requirement that such initial façade inspection be conducted in the eighth year.",
