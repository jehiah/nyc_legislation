  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Buildings (‚ÄúDOB‚Äù) to complete a study evaluating the frequency of the Fa√ßade Inspection and Safety Program (‚ÄúFISP‚Äù) and deliver recommendations concerning the inspection schedule to the Council by December 31, 2025. This bill would also eliminate the existing 5-year FISP cycle, and require DOB to adopt new rules establishing a longer interval of time between FISP cycles, provided that such periodic intervals are between 6 to 12 years. Additionally, this bill would replace the existing requirement that the initial fa√ßade examination for any new building be conducted in the fifth year following the erection or installation of any exterior wall or appurtenance with a requirement that such initial fa√ßade inspection be conducted in the eighth year.",
