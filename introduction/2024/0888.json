  "Summary": "This bill would require that when a purchaser submits an offer to buy a property that the owner has not listed for sale, is not actively selling, did not intend to sell, or where such owner was unaware of their ownership of the property, the purchaser must disclose, in writing, in a clear and conspicuous manner, the estimated market value of the residential property. The purchaser must also disclose the market value of substantially similar properties that are currently listed for sale in a publicly searchable database as designated by rules of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection. Any purchaser who violates this law is liable for a civil penalty of at least $250 for the first violation and at least $500 for a subsequent violation. Each distinct offer that violates this law is considered a separate violation and each day that a violating offer is submitted to the owner is a separate violation that goes toward calculating the total penalty.",
