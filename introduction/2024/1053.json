  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department for the Aging (DFTA) to conduct a feasibility study regarding the creation of older adult information and service centers. Older adult information and service centers would serve as physical locations where older adults can sign-up for city based services and receive information concerning DFTA programming. In the feasibility study, DFTA would be required to identify at least five potential locations in each borough for the creation of older adult information and service centers. The feasibility study will also identify considerations for locating proposed sites and potential services that can be provided at centers. Additionally, the feasibility study would require DFTA to assess the potential benefits of establishing older adult information and service centers and potential constraints. Finally, this bill requires DFTA to submit a report to the Mayor and Speaker of the Council regarding the findings of the feasibility report.",
