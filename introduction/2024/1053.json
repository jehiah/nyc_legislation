  "Summary": "This bill would require the New York City Department for the Aging (DFTA) to conduct a feasibility study regarding the creation of older adult information points. Older adult information points would serve as physical locations where older adults can receive information concerning DFTA services and programming. In the feasibility study, DFTA would be required to identify potential locations in each borough for the creation of older adult information points. The feasibility study would also identify considerations for locating proposed sites and potential services that could be provided at older adult information points. Additionally, the feasibility study would require DFTA to assess the potential benefits and constraints in establishing older adult information points. Finally, this bill would require DFTA to submit a report to the Mayor and Speaker of the Council regarding the findings of the feasibility report, and to post the report on DFTA’s website.",
