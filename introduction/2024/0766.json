  "Summary": "This bill would make it a violation of city law to park, stand, stop, or operate a motor vehicle with an obscured or defaced license plate. For parking, standing, and stopping violations, the bill would preserve existing civil penalties under state law, and would establish that such violation constitutes a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000, imprisonment for not more than 20 days, or both. For the violation relating to operation of a motor vehicle, the bill would impose a civil penalty of $500 for a first violation and $1,000 for each subsequent violation committed within 6 months of the first violation. It would also establish that each such violation constitutes a misdemeanor resulting in the same punishment outlined above.",
