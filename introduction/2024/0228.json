  "Summary": "This bill would require the New York City (NYC) Department for the Aging (DFTA) to make information available to older adults about NYC Care, the NYC Health + Hospitals initiative to provide low or no-cost primary health care to income-eligible NYC residents. DFTA would be required to ensure that such information describes the NYC Care initiative and provides eligibility guidelines for the initiative. This information would be provided to older adults in paper form and made available at all locations where DFTA or DFTA-contracted entities provide services to clients. Such information would include a statement that eligibility to participate in NYC Care is not based on immigration status, and that support services are offered through NYC Care, including access to social workers and care coordinators that connect eligible individuals with housing, legal services, financial assistance, and food assistance.",
