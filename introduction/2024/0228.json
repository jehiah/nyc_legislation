This information would be provided to older adults via hard copy and made available at all locations where DFTA or DFTA-contracted entities provide services to clients. Such information would include a statement that NYC Care is free regardless of immigration status, and that support services are offered through NYC Care, including access to social workers and care coordinators that connect eligible individuals with housing, legal services, financial assistance, and food assistance.",
