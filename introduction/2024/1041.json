  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to conduct an annual outreach campaign to inform parents and legal guardians about their rights regarding their children in child care programs in New York City. The campaign would focus on providing information to parents and legal guardians on how they can make complaints to relevant local and state agencies regarding such programs, their right to unrestricted access to their child and the facility, the notices that such programs must post and display pursuant to law, such as the most recent child performance summary card, and the information that such programs must provide to parents, including upon request. Campaign materials must include information on how to ascertain whether a program has epinephrine auto-injectors or opioid antagonists on site, and whether staff are trained to administer such. The materials must be made available to all child care programs, schools, recreation centers, hospitals, pediatric healthcare providers, and government offices. The bill would also require New York City regulated child care programs to distribute the information from the outreach campaign to each parent or legal guardian upon enrollment. Lastly, the bill would require that all such materials be made available electronically on DOHMH’s child care directory.",
