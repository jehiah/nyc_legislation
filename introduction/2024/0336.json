  "Summary": "This bill would require the New York City Police Department (“NYPD”) to create a website for victims of a serious motor vehicle collision to access information about the collision, including updates on the status of the investigation of the collision, whether or not any summonses had been issued and whether any witnesses had been identified. Victims’ family representatives, next of kin, attorneys or agents would also be granted access to that information. This bill would also require the Department of Transportation (“Department of Transportation”) to create a guide for collision victims. Such guide would include information related to police reports and no-fault insurance benefits. NYPD officers responding to collisions would be required to provide a copy of the guide to all parties in a collision. The guide would also be posted in every precinct and available on the NYPD and DOT websites.",
