  "Summary": "This bill would require the Commissioner of Transportation to create and maintain an online capital project tracker on the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) website, to be updated three times a year, which provides detailed information on each pending public-facing capital project under DOT’s jurisdiction. This tracker would not include any capital projects undertaken by DOT to address specific benchmarks included in any transportation master plan issued by DOT under section 19-199.1 of the Administrative Code.",
