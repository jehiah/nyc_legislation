  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Environmental Protection and the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to permanently establish the COVID-19 Wastewater Testing Program initially established through Local Law 28 of 2021. This bill would also require publication of the results of wastewater testing under the program on the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene’s website on a weekly basis. Finally, the bill would also require DOHMH, in consultation with DEP, to submit a report on the COVID-19 wastewater Testing Program to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council by August 31 of each year.",

Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings:\n      PCR using N1 primer. The term \"PCR using N1 primer\" means the measurement of the copies of the targeted viral RNA segment in wastewater sample using a polymerase chain reaction based method.\n      SARS-CoV-2. The term \"SARS-CoV-2\" means severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, which is the strain of coronavirus that causes the disease COVID-19.\n      Wastewater-based epidemiology. The term \"wastewater-based epidemiology\" means the chemical analysis of pollutants, viruses, and biomarkers in raw wastewater to obtain qualitative and quantitative data on disease activity among inhabitants within a given wastewater catchment.\n      b. Wastewater sampling and testing. The commissioner, in consultation with the commissioner of health and mental hygiene, shall conduct wastewater-based epidemiology sampling and testing to quantify the levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater at each city wastewater treatment plant in accordance with this section. Such sampling shall occur on a frequency of no less than twice per week and shall measure the number of copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels through the PCR using N1 primer testing method or another testing method that reflects industry best practices. \n      c. Weekly publication of results. The commissioner of health and mental hygiene shall publish the results of testing provided for in subdivision b of this section no less than weekly on the department of health and mental hygiene's website.\n      d.
