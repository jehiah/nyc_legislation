  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to declare any day on which the federal Air Quality Index is expected to or does exceed 150 as a “Spare the Air Day,” and to post on its website and publicly disseminate information concerning the air quality emergency. The bill would also require DEP to work with other agencies to implement emergency response protocols on Spare the Air Days, including by ensuring that all clean air centers are open to the public, distributing face masks, opening High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes, and creating short-term access to shelters for homeless individuals. The bill would also prohibit outdoor charcoal grilling on Spare the Air Days, as well as other activities that impair outdoor air quality, as determined by DEP in collaboration with the New York City Office of Emergency Management and any other relevant agency.",
