  "Summary": "The bill would require the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), or another agency designated by the Mayor with the appropriate subject matter expertise, to establish a 3-year pilot program that provides access to sleep apnea screenings at no cost as well as access to home sleep apnea tests, if deemed appropriate. The bill would require DOHMH to prioritize individuals without insurance. This bill would also require DOHMH to publish a report on the pilot program’s effectiveness and whether it should be made permanent, and to conduct a public education and outreach campaign on sleep apnea and the pilot program’s availability. The bill would take effect immediately.",
