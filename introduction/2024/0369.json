  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Buildings (DOB) to establish a pilot program for the use of drones, in conjunction with physical examinations and close-up inspections, in the inspection of building façades. The pilot program must run for at least one year. This bill would also require DOB to continue to study the impact of the use of drones in building façade inspections, and their potential use in the course of other DOB work, and to submit a report of the study’s findings.",
