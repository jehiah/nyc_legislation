  "Summary": "This bill would impose minimum standards for the processing of claims for certain benefits offered to municipal employees of New York City, and require the establishment of an online portal through which municipal employees could submit and track their benefits claims, receive information about benefits, and communicate with benefits administrators. This bill would require the New York City Office of Labor Relations (OLR) to submit an annual report on employees’ utilization of such portal and basic data on claims processing by administrators. This bill would also require OLR to create a City Benefits Help Center, which would be responsible for offering information and guidance to employees about the availability and structure of benefits. Finally, this bill would require OLR to design and administer a one-time survey for municipal employees to provide feedback on the substance and administration of benefits.",
