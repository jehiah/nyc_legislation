  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Cultural Affairs (DCLA) to maintain a list of all known burial sites of formerly enslaved African Americans citywide. This bill would also require DCLA to develop and implement a plan to locate any currently unmarked burial sites for formerly enslaved African Americans citywide, in consultation with other city agencies, organizations and experts. This bill would also require DCLA to notify elected officials when a burial site has been located in their district. Finally, this bill would require DCLA to develop an educational campaign to inform City residents about the burial sites and develop and maintain an interactive map of the burial sites on the DCLA website.",
