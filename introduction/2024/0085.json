  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), in consultation with the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs (MOIA) and any agency designated by the mayor, to develop a health survey of newly arrived migrants and asylum seekers to elicit information related to long-term health needs and chronic conditions of migrants and asylum seekers, healthcare service requests from migrants and asylum seekers, healthcare referrals or interventions provided to migrants and asylum seekers, and, to the extent practicable, the outcomes of those referrals or interventions. The bill would require MOIA, in consultation with DOHMH and any agency designated by the mayor, to conduct the survey annually in multiple languages in locations serving migrants and asylum seekers. The bill would require DOHMH to submit an annual report to the Council reporting on the survey results and recommending ways to identify and anticipate health needs of migrants and asylum seekers residing in New York City.",
