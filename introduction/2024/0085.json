The bill would require the designated mayoral office or agency to conduct the survey annually in multiple languages in locations serving migrants. The bill would require the designated mayoral office or agency to submit an annual report to the Council reporting on the survey results and recommending ways to identify and anticipate health needs of migrants residing in New York City.",
