  "Summary": "This bill would require an office or agency designated by the mayor, in consultation with the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs and any other office or agency designated by the mayor, to develop a health survey of migrants, including specifically those who have arrived recently and those who seek asylum, to elicit information related to long-term health needs, chronic conditions, and healthcare access needs of such migrants. The bill would require the designated mayoral office or agency to conduct the survey annually in multiple languages in locations serving migrants. The bill would require the designated mayoral office or agency to submit an annual report to the Council reporting on the survey results and recommending ways to identify and anticipate health needs of migrants residing in New York City.",
