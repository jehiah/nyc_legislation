  "Summary": "This bill would make it unlawful for any dealer to park, store, or otherwise maintain a motor vehicle upon a city street for the purpose of displaying the motor vehicle for sale or greasing or repairing such motor vehicle, except in the case of an emergency repair. Additionally, it would prohibit any dealer from parking, storing, or otherwise maintaining on any street a motor vehicle in the dealer’s possession while awaiting repair or return to the owner or lessee of such motor vehicle. Dealers in possession of motor vehicles awaiting repair or return to the owner or lessee would be required to display a placard through the motor vehicle’s forward windshield. Each violation of these prohibitions would be punishable by a fine and may lead to vehicle impoundment. The bill would create an affirmative defense for an owner or lessee of a motor vehicle if they receive a summons while the vehicle is in the possession of a dealer.",
