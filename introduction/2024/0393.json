  "Summary": "This bill would reduce the duration of sidewalk shed permits issued in connection with a façade repair from 1 year to 3 months. The duration of sidewalk shed permits connected to demolition, a building alteration, or new building construction would remain undisturbed. This bill would also create new penalties enforceable by the Department of Buildings (“DOB”) for sidewalk sheds occupying the public right of way where a building owner has failed to conduct necessary façade repairs in a timely manner. Penalties would be enforced beginning with the second permit renewal, increasing based on the size and age of the shed. Finally, reports accompanying an application for a sidewalk shed permit renewal would be required to include information on work performed during the period of time since the last renewal; if work has not been performed during that time, documentation illustrating the applicable reason for the lack of work may be accepted by DOB for the purpose of renewing the permit.",
