  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) to maintain an interactive webpage with agency specific information about the city government workforce. The data presented would include information on workforce composition, demographics, salary, hiring, separation, and residency. The webpage would also include a public hiring tracker that would be updated every two weeks with information on the number of employees hired by and separated from each agency, the current agency headcount, and percentage of each agency’s personnel budget spent since the start of the fiscal year. Finally, this bill would require DCAS to publish a report twice a year that would aggregate and summarize the information provided on the interactive webpage.",
