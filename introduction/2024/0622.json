  "Summary": "This bill would clarify that in tenant harassment claims, lawful occupants may not be denied injunctive relief, including restoration of possession, because they are not tenants, or on the basis that the court deems such restoration futile because the lawful occupant would be subject to a meritorious claim of possession against them, as long as no such judgment of possession has actually yet been granted.",
