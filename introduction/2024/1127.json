  "Summary": "This bill would establish a basement and cellar dwelling unit legalization program in certain community districts. Building owners would be able to apply for an authorization for temporary residence for units that existed prior to April 20, 2024. The Department of Buildings would inspect such units prior to issuing an authorization and, if issued, the building owner would be permitted to do any necessary construction on the unit to legalize the unit and apply for an amended or partial certificate of occupancy. The Department of Housing Preservation and Development would be required to provide financial and technical assistance and outreach to owners of eligible basement or cellar residences. Tenants who resided in the basement or cellar unit on April 20, 2024 would have a right of first refusal to return to such unit upon its first occupancy following any necessary alterations.",

Certificates of occupancy pursuant to this local law. a.

Such a partial or amended certificate of occupancy shall be issued subject to the following conditions:\n            (1) Upon inspection, the apartment being created or altered (i) conforms substantially to the approved construction documents, complies with the New York city construction codes and other applicable laws, except as specifically provided in this local law, and is safe for occupancy, or (ii) the department upon an inspection certifies that waiver of otherwise applicable requirements is appropriate because such apartment provides for the health and safety of all occupants of such dwelling by alternative means that are no less stringent than the requirements of this local law. \n            (2) Upon inspection, the required means of egress from all floors of the building comply with the New York city construction codes and other applicable laws.\n            (3) Except as specified in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of this paragraph, a partial or amended certificate of occupancy or a temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued where there are open pre-existing violations in the building. All such open violations, including those specified below, shall remain administratively open and the department may thereafter continue to enforce against such violations until, in accordance with applicable provisions of the New York city construction codes, outstanding penalties are paid and, if applicable, certificates of correction are approved by the department.\n            (A) Where a pre-existing violation in parts of the building outside of the new or altered apartment is classified as \"immediately hazardous,\" the condition that gave rise to the issuance of such immediately hazardous violation must be removed or remedied in accordance with the New York city construction codes and to the satisfaction of the commissioner of buildings and evidence of such removal or remediation in the form of plans, drawings, photos, affidavits or a combination thereof, with the signature and seal of a registered design professional or, if applicable, a licensee of the department in the applicable trade must be submitted to the department prior to the issuance of such amended or partial certificate of occupancy or a temporary certificate of occupancy.\n            (B) Any condition that gave rise to a pre-existing violation in the new or altered apartment must be removed or remedied by work performed under permits issued pursuant to this local law.\n            (C) Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of the New York city construction codes, including sections 28-118.14 and 28-219.1, a certificate of occupancy or a temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued for a basement or cellar apartment created or altered pursuant to this local law where there are outstanding fines and civil penalties for pre-existing violations provided that such fines and civil penalties may remain due and owing, and the department may thereafter enforce and collect such amounts in accordance with the New York city construction codes, unless such department determines that such fines and civil penalties should be waived in the interest of the program. When determining whether to waive such fines and civil penalties, the department may consider factors including the number and pecuniary amount of fines and civil penalties owed, the financial need of the owner, and the likely effect of such fines and civil penalties on compliance with such codes. \n            b. The department may refuse to issue a certificate of occupancy or a temporary certificate of occupancy pursuant to this section if there are outstanding violations issued by the department, penalties or open permits not signed off related to work performed under permits issued pursuant to this local law until such penalties have been paid, such violations have been corrected, including filing certificates of correction, if applicable, and permits have been closed, as required by the New York city construction codes.\n            c. (1) Every certificate of occupancy or temporary certificate of occupancy issued for a basement or cellar apartment created or altered pursuant to this local law must contain a reference to this local law.\n            (2) A partial or amended certificate of occupancy or a temporary certificate of occupancy issued pursuant to subdivision a of this section must contain a note that such certificate of occupancy does not certify compliance with applicable laws with respect to parts of the building outside of the apartment created or altered pursuant to this local law.\n            ï¿½ 7. Waiver of application, permit and inspection fees by the department. The commissioner shall waive all fees, which would otherwise be required to be paid to the department by title 28 of the administrative code, the electrical code or the rules of the department, in connection with applications, permits and inspections for work in the program area related to the creation or alteration of habitable apartments in basements and cellars where such apartments are officially subsidized under the program administered by the department of housing preservation and development pursuant to section eleven of this local law.\n            ï¿½ 8. Waiver of fees by other agencies. The department of environmental protection shall waive all fees which would otherwise be required to be paid to such department arising out of the creation or alteration of habitable apartments in basements and cellars where such apartments are officially subsidized under the program administered by the department of housing preservation and development pursuant to section fourteen of this local law. Any other agency may promulgate rules to waive fees that would otherwise be required to be paid arising out of the creation or alteration of such apartments where such apartments are officially subsidized under the program administered by the department of housing preservation and development pursuant to section fourteen of this local law, and where such agency determines that such waiver would facilitate such program.\n            ï¿½ 9. Compliance with fire code sprinkler requirements for altered buildings on substandard width streets. Any habitable apartment in a basement or cellar created or altered pursuant to sections three of this local law shall be deemed to be an alteration subject to exception 5.1 of section 501.4.3.1 of the New York city fire code.\n            ï¿½ 10. Construction. Except as specifically provided in this local law, nothing in this local law is intended to grant authorization for any work to be done in any manner in violation of the provisions of the New York city construction codes, or any other law or rule.\n            ï¿½ 11. Enforcement and penalties. a. Violations of this local law and rules of the department issued pursuant to this local law shall be subject to enforcement and penalties in accordance with chapter 2 of title 28 of the administrative code of the city of New York.\n            b. The department may, after notice and opportunity to be heard, revoke an authorization for temporary residence: \n            (1) where 3 or more violations of this local law or rules of the department have been committed within a 1 year period, or\n            (2) where any violation of paragraph (1) or (2) of subdivision h of section four of this local law has been committed.\n            c. Where an authorization for temporary residence expires or is revoked before a certificate of occupancy or temporary certificate of occupancy is issued for an eligible basement or cellar residence, the department may:\n            (1) issue a vacate order if the basement or cellar is occupied, \n            (2) reinstate any prosecution for illegal occupancy that was deferred or waived pursuant to this local law, and\n            (3) reinstate and commence collection of any penalties that were deferred or waived pursuant to section five or six of this local law, including interest that would have accrued from the time of such deferral or waiver.\n            ï¿½ 12. Variance. An owner of an eligible basement or cellar residence located in the 10-year rainfall flood risk area or the coastal flood risk area may apply to the board of standards and appeals for a variance from the restrictions of section U202.3 of the New York city building code. In reviewing an application for a variance, the board of standards and appeals shall consider the conditions described in section G105.6, of the New York city building code and shall issue such a variance in accordance with section G105.7 of such code. Where a variance is issued such owner may apply for an authorization for temporary residence pursuant to this local law.\n            ï¿½ 13. Zoning. Within 90 days of the passage of this local law, the city planning commission shall propose amendments to the zoning resolution necessary to enact such program. Such amendments shall be subject to a public hearing at the planning commission and approval by such commission and by the city council in accordance with section 197-d of the New York city charter and subdivision 3 of section 289 of the multiple dwelling law, provided, however, that such amendments shall not require environmental review, including environmental review conducted pursuant to article 8 of the New York State environmental conservation law and any state and local regulations promulgated thereunder, or any additional land use review.\n            ï¿½ 14. Financial and technical assistance and outreach. a. The department of housing preservation and development shall establish a program to: \n            b. Subject to available resources, provide city financial assistance to owners of eligible basement or cellar residences that are contained within one-family or two-family homes who meet criteria set forth by such department in a rule, such as the financial need of an owner in order to meet the requirements of this local law, expected likelihood of such owner to repay any loans provided as part of such financial assistance, and the opportunity for the creation of an affordable rental housing unit.\n            c. Provide technical assistance to owners of eligible basement or cellar residences that are contained within one-family or two-family homes;\n            d. Conduct public education and outreach to owners of dwellings such department determines are likely to include eligible conversions.\n            ï¿½ 15. Tenant protections a. An application for authorization for temporary residence pursuant to section four of this local law must be accompanied by a certification from the owner of an eligible basement or cellar residence indicating whether such residence was rented to a tenant on April 20, 2024, notwithstanding whether the occupancy of such residence was authorized by law.
