  "Summary": "This bill would establish a basement and cellar dwelling unit legalization program in certain community districts. Building owners would be able to apply for an authorization for temporary residence for units that existed prior to April 20, 2024. The Department of Buildings would inspect such units prior to issuing an authorization and, if issued, the building owner would be permitted to do any necessary construction on the unit to legalize the unit and apply for an amended or partial certificate of occupancy. The Department of Housing Preservation and Development would be required to provide technical assistance and outreach to owners of eligible basement or cellar residences. Tenants who resided in the basement or cellar unit on April 20, 2024 would have a right of first refusal to return to such unit upon its first occupancy following any necessary alterations.",

An eligible basement or cellar residence must be in compliance with any additional safety or construction requirements established pursuant to rules promulgated by the department in consultation with the fire department and the office of emergency management.\n            \n� 28-507.5 Deferral or waiver of penalties by the department. Payment of any civil penalties for violations issued by the department that would otherwise be required to be paid by an owner of an eligible basement or cellar residence before the issuance of a permit for alterations to comply with section 28-507.4 may be deferred, and upon issuance of a certificate of occupancy or temporary certificate of occupancy in accordance with section 28-507.6, such deferred amounts may be waived. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, deferred amounts shall continue to be due and owing to the department. Where an owner fails to comply with the requirements of this article, deferred amounts shall no longer be deferred and payment may be enforced in accordance with this code. \n            \n� 28-507.6 Certificates of occupancy pursuant to this article. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of the multiple dwelling law, article 118 of chapter 1, or of any other law, where an eligible basement or cellar residence in a one- or two-family home has been issued an authorization for temporary residence in accordance with section 28-507.4, the department may issue a certificate of occupancy pursuant to the article as follows: \n\n1. For a building erected prior to January 1, 1938 that does not have and is not otherwise required to have a certificate of occupancy, issue a partial certificate of occupancy limited to the new or altered apartment in the basement of a building or the new apartment in the cellar of a building. \n\n2. For a building with an existing certificate of occupancy, issue an amended certificate of occupancy limited to the new or altered apartment in the basement of such building or the new apartment in the cellar of such building. \n\n� 28-507.6.1 Issuance of an amended or partial certificate of occupancy. A partial or amended certificate of occupancy shall be issued subject to the following conditions:\n\n1. Upon inspection, the apartment being created or altered (i) conforms substantially to the approved construction documents, complies with this code and other applicable laws, except as specifically provided in this article, and is safe for occupancy, or (ii) the department upon an inspection certifies that waiver of otherwise applicable requirements is appropriate because such apartment provides for the health and safety of all occupants of such dwelling by alternative means that are no less stringent than the requirements of this article. \n\n2. Upon inspection, the required means of egress from all floors of the building comply with this code and other applicable laws.\n\n3. A partial or amended certificate of occupancy or a temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued where there are open pre-existing violations in the building. All such open violations, including those specified in the exceptions below, shall remain administratively open and the department may thereafter continue to enforce against such violations until, in accordance with applicable provisions of this code, outstanding penalties are paid and, if applicable, certificates of correction are approved by the department.\n\nExceptions: \n\n1. Where a pre-existing violation in parts of the building outside of the new or altered apartment is classified as \"immediately hazardous,\" the condition that gave rise to the issuance of such immediately hazardous violation must be removed or remedied in accordance with the New York city construction codes and to the satisfaction of the commissioner of buildings, and evidence of such removal or remediation in the form of plans, drawings, photos, affidavits, or a combination thereof, with the signature and seal of a registered design professional or, if applicable, a licensee of the department in the applicable trade, must be submitted to the department prior to the issuance of such amended or partial certificate of occupancy or a temporary certificate of occupancy. \n\n2. Any condition that gave rise to a pre-existing violation in the new or altered apartment must be removed or remedied by work performed under permits issued pursuant to this article. \n\n3. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of this code, including sections 28-118.14 and 28-219.1, a certificate of occupancy or a temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued for a basement or cellar apartment created or altered pursuant to this article where there are outstanding fines and civil penalties for pre-existing violations, provided that such fines and civil penalties may remain due and owing, and the department may thereafter enforce and collect such amounts in accordance with this code, unless such department determines that such fines and civil penalties should be waived in the interest of the program. When determining whether to waive such fines and civil penalties, the department may consider factors including the number and pecuniary amount of fines and civil penalties owed, the financial need of the owner, and the likely effect of such fines and civil penalties on compliance with this code. \n      \n� 28-507.6.2 Refusal to issue a certificate of occupancy or temporary certificate of occupancy. The department may refuse to issue a certificate of occupancy or a temporary certificate of occupancy pursuant to this section if there are outstanding violations issued by the department, penalties or open permits not signed off related for work performed under permits issued pursuant to this article until such penalties have been paid, such violations have been corrected, including filing certificates of correction, if applicable, and permits have been closed, as required by this code. \n\n� 28-507.6.3 Certificates of occupancy to reference this article. Every certificate of occupancy or temporary certificate of occupancy issued for a basement or cellar apartment in a one- or two-family home created or altered pursuant to this article must contain a reference to this article. A partial or amended certificate of occupancy or a temporary certificate of occupancy issued pursuant to section 28-507.6 must contain a note that such certificate of occupancy does not certify compliance with applicable laws with respect to parts of the building outside of the apartment created or altered pursuant to this article. \n\n� 28-507.6.4 Certificate of occupancy for one- or two-family home. Where a basement or cellar in a one- or two-family home has been issued an authorization for temporary residence in accordance with section 28-507.4, the department shall issue a certificate of occupancy, temporary certificate of occupancy, partial certificate of occupancy, or amended certificate of occupancy for such dwelling in accordance with the requirements of appendix U of the New York city building code. \n\n� 28-507.6.5 Certificate of occupancy for a multiple dwelling. Except as may be provided in the rules of the department, in consultation with the fire department, the office of emergency management, the department of housing preservation and development, the department environmental protection, and the department health and mental hygiene, where a basement or cellar in a multiple dwelling has been issued an authorization for temporary residence in accordance with section 28-507.4, the department shall issue a certificate of occupancy, temporary certificate of occupancy, or amended certificate of occupancy for such dwelling in accordance with the requirements of this code for Group R-2 occupancy.\n            \n� 28-507.7 Waiver of application, permit, and inspection fees by the department. The commissioner shall waive all fees, which would otherwise be required to be paid to the department by this title, the New York city electrical code, or the rules of the department, in connection with applications, permits, and inspections for work in the program area related to the creation or alteration of habitable apartments in basements and cellars where such apartments are officially subsidized under the program administered by the department of housing preservation and development pursuant to section 28-507.12.\n      \n� 28-507.8 Waiver of fees by other agencies. The department of environmental protection shall waive all fees which would otherwise be required to be paid to such department arising out of the creation or alteration of habitable apartments in basements and cellars where such apartments are officially subsidized under the program administered by the department of housing preservation and development pursuant to section 28-507.12. Any other agency may promulgate rules to waive fees that would otherwise be required to be paid arising out of the creation or alteration of such apartments where such apartments are officially subsidized under the program administered by the department of housing preservation and development pursuant to section 28-507.12, and where such agency determines that such waiver would facilitate such program.\n      \n� 28-507.9 Compliance with fire code sprinkler requirements for altered buildings on substandard width streets. Any habitable apartment in a basement or cellar created or altered pursuant to section 28-507.3 shall be deemed to be an alteration subject to exception 5.1 of section 501.4.3.1 of the New York city fire code.\n      \n� 28-507.10 Construction. Except as specifically provided in this article, nothing in this article is intended to grant authorization for any work to be done in any manner in violation of the provisions of this code, or any other law or rule.\n      \n� 28-507.11 Enforcement and revocation.
