  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to establish a menstrual health program that would offer screenings for endometriosis and polycystic ovarian syndrome to patients displaying symptoms of these disorders. The bill would also allow DOHMH to make appropriate referrals for services related to endometriosis and polycystic ovarian syndrome. The bill additionally would expand the list of sexual health topics about which DOHMH must provide outreach, education, and support to include endometriosis and polycystic ovarian syndrome.",
