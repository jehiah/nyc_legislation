  "Summary": "This bill would require that a tenant be promptly notified if a mold assessor determines that mold remediation is necessary in the tenant’s apartment unit. Currently, a tenant may not receive information about the results of a mold assessment until the landlord has paid for the assessment. In the event the landlord’s payment is delayed, the tenant may not learn of a dangerous mold condition until long after it was discovered. To avoid this, the proposed legislation would (1) require the mold assessor to notify the landlord within 24 hours of discovering a potentially dangerous mold condition, and (2) require the landlord to notify the tenant within 24 hours of receiving such notice.",
