Subdivision 12 of section 3-702 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 34 for the year 2007, is amended to read as follows:  \t \n      12. The term \"intermediary\" shall mean an individual, corporation, partnership, political committee, employee organization or other entity which, (i) other than in the regular course of business as a postal, delivery or messenger service, delivers, including though the use of a personalized hyperlink, any contribution from another person or entity to a candidate or other authorized committee; or (ii) solicits contributions to a candidate or other authorized committee where such solicitation is known to such candidate or his or her authorized committee. For purposes of clause (ii) of this subdivision only persons clearly identified as the solicitor of a contribution to the candidate or his or her authorized committee shall be presumed to be known to such candidate or his or her authorized committee. \"Intermediary\" shall not include spouses, domestic partners, parents, children or siblings of the person making such contribution, or any fundraising agent, as such term is defined in the rules of the board or any hosts of a campaign sponsored fundraising event paid for in whole or in part by the campaign. Where there are multiple individual hosts for a non-campaign sponsored event, the hosts shall designate one such host as the intermediary.\n       � 2. Section 3-703 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new subdivision 1-d to read as follows: \n      1-d. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of this section, a participating candidate or his or her principal committee may not accept, either directly or by transfer, any contribution or contributions for a covered election in which he or she is a participating candidate which a natural person who has business dealings with the city, as that term is defined in subdivision eighteen of section 3-702, has delivered as described in clause (i) of subdivision twelve of section 3-702 if the aggregate of such contributions to such candidate from such person for all covered elections in the same calendar year exceeds: (i) for the office of mayor, public advocate or comptroller four hundred dollars; (ii) for borough president three hundred twenty dollars; and (iii) for member of the city council two hundred fifty dollars. For purposes of this subdivision, \"person\" has the same meaning as set forth in subdivision 1-a of this section.\n      � 3.
