  "Summary": "This bill would expand the definition of an “intermediary” to include the use of personalized hyperlinks as a method of delivering contributions. The definition of intermediary would also be revised to remove the exception for multiple hosts of campaign sponsored fundraising events, which previously allowed just one individual to be designated as the host, as well as the exception for fundraisers paid for by the campaign. It also requires the Campaign Finance Board’s (CFB) fundraising platform to include a function that allows candidate to generate a report of all contributions submitted using a specific personalized hyperlink. The bill would require candidates to maintain records for all fundraising events, which would include specific details about the events. The campaigns would provide these records to the CFB within the CFB’s reporting deadlines.",
