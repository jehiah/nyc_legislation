The training would be mandatory for all uniformed members of the department whose responsibilities include routinely interacting with arrested individuals and victims of crime on recognizing and responding to mental health emergencies. The training would provide information on symptoms of mental illness, effective communication with a person experiencing a mental health emergency, how to de-escalate a mental health emergency, and alternatives to involuntary removal to a hospital.",
