  "Summary": "This bill would require the New York City Police Department (NYPD) to report additional data in quarterly and annual reporting on officers’ use of force. Current reporting requirements create various categories for “use of force incidents,” but do not specifically name motor vehicles as a means of such force. This bill would add “use of a motor vehicle to gain control of a subject” as a reporting category.",
