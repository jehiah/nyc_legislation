The timeframe required for notification is extended if the emergency occurs during overnight hours.",

Chapter 18 of title 17 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 17-1806 to read as follows:\n      � 17-1806 Communication following a suicide attempt by, hospitalization of or serious injury to an incarcerated individual. a. Definition. For the purposes of this section, the term \"serious injury\" means a physical injury that results in a substantial risk of death or disfigurement, loss or impairment of a bodily organ, or post-concussion syndrome, or any injury involving the fracture of a bone that correctional health services determines is serious due to the severity of such injury or risk of permanent harm presented by such injury.\n      b. Correctional health services shall notify the attorney of record of an incarcerated individual, and an emergency contact designated by such incarcerated individual pursuant to paragraph 3 of subdivision c, following a suicide attempt by, hospitalization of, or serious injury to such incarcerated individual, provided that the incarcerated individual has consented, pursuant to subdivision c, to correctional health services providing such notification.\n      c. Correctional health services, as part of an intake screening for health purposes performed for an incarcerated individual at the time of admittance to a facility of the department of correction, shall:\n      1. Request consent from each such incarcerated individual for correctional health services to provide, pursuant to subdivision b, a notification following:\n      (a) A suicide attempt by such incarcerated individual;\n      (b) Hospitalization of such incarcerated individual; or \n      (c) Serious injury to such incarcerated individual;\n      2. Make a good faith effort to ascertain the attorney of record of an incarcerated individual who provides such consent; and \n      3. Request each incarcerated individual who provides such consent to designate no more than 1 natural person to serve as an emergency contact for such individual, for purposes of providing a notification pursuant to subdivision b. \n      d. Correctional health services shall provide a notification required pursuant to subdivision b within 3 hours of correctional health services confirming a suicide attempt by an incarcerated individual, becoming aware of a hospitalization of an incarcerated individual, or making a determination that an injury to an incarcerated individual is a serious injury, except that:\n      1.
