  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Section 3307.6.2 of the New York city building code, as amended by local law number 126 for the year 2021, is amended to read as follows:\n3307.6.2 Where required. A sidewalk shed shall be installed and maintained to protect all sidewalks, walkways, and pathways within the property line of a site, and all public sidewalks that abut the property, as follows:\n1.\tWhen such sidewalk, walkway, or pathway is to be located immediately below a scaffold, mast climber, or chute.  The sidewalk shed shall be installed prior to the installation of such equipment and shall not be removed until such equipment has been dismantled and/or removed from the area being protected;\n2.\tWhen a structure higher than 40 feet (12 192 mm) or greater is to be constructed, and the sidewalk, walkway, or pathway is within a perpendicular distance from the new structure that is equal to or less than half the height of the new structure.  The sidewalk shed shall be installed when the structure reaches the planned height of the shed.  Such shed shall not be removed until the structure is enclosed, all exterior work has been completed and the sash is glazed above the second story, the fa�ade has been cleaned down, and all exterior chutes, scaffolds, mast climbers, and hoisting equipment have been dismantled and removed from the site;\n3.\tWhen a portion of a fa�ade over 40 feet (12 192 mm) above curb level is to be constructed, altered, maintained, or repaired, or a vertical or horizontal enlargement is to occur at a height over 40 feet (12 192 mm) above curb level, and the sidewalk, walkway, or pathway is within a perpendicular distance from the structure that is equal to or less than half the height of such fa�ade work or vertical or horizontal enlargement.  The sidewalk shed shall be installed prior to the commencement of work at a height greater than 40 feet (12 192 mm) above curb level.  Such shed shall not be removed until the building is enclosed, all exterior work has been completed and the sash is glazed above the second story, the fa�ade has been cleaned down, and all exterior chutes, scaffolds, mast climbers, and hoisting equipment have been dismantled and removed from the site; or\n4.\tWhen a structure higher than 25 feet (7620 mm) is to undergo a full demolition, or when exterior partial demolition, other than that performed in conjunction with the construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair of a fa�ade, is to occur at a height greater than 25 feet (7620 mm) above curb level, and the sidewalk, walkway, or pathway is within a perpendicular distance from the structure that is equal to or less than half the height of the demolition work.  The sidewalk shed shall be installed prior to the commencement of demolition work.  Such shed shall remain in place until the building has been razed to the height of the shed, or where the building is not being fully demolished, until all demolition work has been completed and all exterior chutes, scaffolds, mast climbers, and hoisting equipment have been dismantled and removed from the site.\nExceptions: Except where specifically required by the commissioner to protect the public from unique hazards at the site, sidewalk sheds are not required for:\n1.\tSidewalks, walkways, and pathways, or portions thereof, that are closed to the public.\n2.\tTemporary walkways in accordance with Section 3307.2.3 that are provided with lighting and overhead protection equivalent to that afforded by a sidewalk shed.\n3.\tInspections, including a fa�ade inspection, provided no work occurs during the inspection.\n4.\tSign hanging occurring by or under the direct and continuing supervision of a licensed sign hanger.\n5.\tWindow washing.\n6.\tWork confined to the roof of an existing building, provided that:\n6.1. The edge of the roof is enclosed to a height of 42 inches (1067 mm) with a solid parapet;\n6.2. Such parapet is of sufficient strength to resist accidental impact during construction; \n6.3. The work does not exceed the height of the parapet or is set back from the edge of the roof at a distance that is equal to or greater than half the height of the work; and\n6.4. No work occurs on the parapet itself, and no material is placed or stored on the parapet during the course of the work.\n7.\tSubject to the approval of the commissioner, work of limited scope and duration provided that:\n7.1.\tDuring the course of the work the area immediately under the work zone is temporarily closed to the public by means of barriers, cones, or caution tape, and flagpersons are provided to direct pedestrian traffic;\n7.2.\tAt the end of the day the fa�ade of the building is left in a safe condition and fully enclosed; and\n7.3.\tThere is compliance with Section 3307.2.1.\n8.\tLocations where a cantilevered platform has been installed, provided that:\n8.1.\tThe cantilevered platform is approved by the commissioner.\n8.2.\tThe cantilevered platform provides overhead protection equivalent to a sidewalk shed deck.\n8.3.\tThe cantilevered platform is installed below the level of work to be performed, excluding work performed at the first story. However, the cantilevered platform must still provide the minimum clearances specified by Section 3307.6.4.7.\n8.4.\tThe area under the cantilevered platform is provided with lighting in accordance with Section 3307.6.4.8 if the street lighting does not provide adequate lighting to fulfill this requirement.\n8.5.\tThe cantilevered platform meets all other requirements established in rules promulgated by the commissioner.\n9.\t[Areas along an exposure that are located more than 5 feet (1524 mm) beyond those required for compliance with Item 1 of Section 3307.6.2, provided that:] Locations where a supported scaffold, or an equivalent alternative system acceptable to the commissioner, has been installed to cover the entire exposure where work is occurring, provided that:\n9.1.\t[The work is limited to the alteration, maintenance, or repair of a fa�ade, and does not constitute a fa�ade recladding as defined in rules promulgated by the commissioner; and] The supported scaffold, or alternate system, is provided with netting and guardrails in accordance with Section 3314.8, or an equivalent means of enclosing the scaffold or alternate system.\n9.2. [The entire exposure where fa�ade work is to occur is covered by either:] A catchall that projects at least 5 feet (1524 mm) in the horizontal is provided.  The catchall shall connect to the scaffold or alternate system at a height of 10 feet (3048 mm) to 12 feet (3658 mm) above the level of the ground. The catchall shall be horizontal or may angle up at no more than 45 degrees. The catchall shall provide a level of protection equivalent to a sidewalk shed deck.\n[9.2.1. A supported scaffold with netting and guardrails in accordance with Section 3314.8; or\n9.2.2. A site specific engineered enclosure system in accordance with Section 3309.17.]\n9.3. The area immediately under the scaffold or alternative system, not including the catchall, is closed to the public unless the scaffold or alternative system rests on a sidewalk shed, a cantilevered system that meets the provisions of Exception 8 of this Section, or the level immediately above the area open to the public is decked such that it provides a level of protection equivalent to that of a sidewalk shed deck.\n9.4.\tThe scaffold or alternate system is installed such that it does not obstruct or diminish required light, air, or egress.\n9.5.\tThe supported scaffold, or alternative system, meets all other requirements established in rules promulgated by the commissioner. \n10.\tA sidewalk shed is not allowed for the construction of a major new building.  Protection in accordance with Exceptions 8 or 9 of this Section must instead be provided.\n11.\tA sidewalk shed is not required to protect against unsafe facade conditions where a mesh enclosure system has been installed in accordance with the following:\n\t11.1.\tThe mesh system is installed in vertical panels and is anchored at the top and the base of the building.\n\t11.2.\tThe top connection is anchored to a separate structural system (i.e. an outrigger system), or if the building parapet is in good condition, to the building parapet. \n\t11.3.\tThe bottom of the mesh is anchored to the ground or to a building at a level below the unsafe fa�ade condition.  If the mesh is anchored at ground level, a barrier at least 32 inches (813 mm) shall be provided to keep pedestrians away from the mesh.  If the mesh is anchored to the building, the mesh and its anchorage must be strong enough to hold the falling object until it can be safely removed.\n\t11.4.\tAdequate intermediate support for the mesh shall be provided. The mesh can be laterally tied to existing building fa�ade stabilization anchors or to sound portions of the facade for additional lateral support, provided that the engineer has verified that the support is adequate for the expected load. If the netting is used solely to contain debris from falling away from the building, only vertical netting will be required.\n\t11.5. \tThe mesh can be laterally tied to existing building fa�ade stabilization anchors or to sound portions of the facade for additional lateral support, provided that the engineer has verified that the support is adequate for the expected load.\n\t11.6. \tIf the netting is used solely to contain debris from falling away from the building, only vertical netting will be required. If the netting is also to provide a horizontal surface to catch falling debris, the net will also need to meet requirements for horizontal netting.\n\t11.7.\tThe mesh enclosure system shall be installed such that it does not obstruct or diminish required light, air, or egress.\n11.8.\tDuring the repair of an unsafe fa�ade condition where a mesh enclosure system has been installed, a sidewalk shed need not be installed where the area under the work complies with the requirements of Exception 7 of this Section.  The mesh enclosure system may be temporarily removed in the location of the work to facilitate work, provided it is reinstalled at the end of the shift.\n11.9.\tThe mesh enclosure system meets all other requirements established in rules promulgated by the commissioner.\n      � 2. Section 3307.6.4.2 of the New York city building code, as amended by local law number 126 for the year 2021, is amended to read as follows:\n3307.6.4.2 Design loads. All sidewalk sheds shall be designed [as a heavy duty sidewalk shed to carry a live load of at least 300 pounds per square foot (1464.6 kg/m).  However, where the shed is installed to protect from work performed at a height of less than 100 feet (30 480 mm) above the ground, the sidewalk shed may be designed as a light duty sidewalk shed to carry a live load of at least 150 pounds per square foot (732.3 kg/m2), provided that no item is stored or placed upon the shed.] for a uniform live load of 100 psf (488.2 kg/m2 ), and a concentrated live load of 2,500 lbs (1133.9 kg) acting on a 12-inch by 12-inch (305 mm by 305 mm) area for all shed horizontal framing elements. These loads shall be placed at the shed location that causes the worst effect. All sidewalk sheds shall also be designed for any additional superimposed and live loads required during construction or demolition, including scaffold leg reactions and storage weights. Storage loads and areas shall be identified in the sidewalk shed drawings. The minimum uniform live load can be reduced to 20 psf (97.6 kg/m2) when applied concurrently with scaffold or storage loads, to avoid double counting of loads.\n      � 3. Section 3307.6.4.2.1 of the New York city building code, as amended by local law number 126 for the year 2021, is amended to read as follows:\n3307.6.4.2.1 Wind and other loads. The effect of wind and other loads on the sidewalk shed, and any item placed or attached on or to the shed, shall be considered in the design in accordance with Chapter 16.  This shall include, but need not be limited to lateral and vertical load effects of wind and earthquake loads per Section 1609 and 1613 as modified by Section 1619 as applicable.

Where an item is to be stored or placed upon a heavy duty sidewalk shed, and such storage or placement is in excess of 150 pounds per square foot (732.4 kg/m2) on any square foot area of the sidewalk shed, such shed shall be designed to carry:\n\t2.3.1. The live load of 300 pounds per square foot (1464.7 kg/m2) required of a heavy duty sidewalk shed; and\n\t2.3.2. The load of the item to be placed or stored upon the shed, minus 150 pounds per square foot (732.4 kg/m2).\n2.4. The decking of the sidewalk shed does not consist of the light-transmitting plastic material.] \nNo material shall be stored or placed upon a sidewalk shed unless the shed is designed for such storage or placement, with such areas of storage or placement clearly designated on the drawings and the designer has verified the adequacy of the decking material.\n      � 5. Chapter 33 of the New York city building code is amended by adding new section 3307.6.4.2.3 to read as follows:\n3307.6.4.2.3 Vehicular impact.  Sidewalk sheds shall be designed or protected from vehicular impact in accordance with one of the following:\n1. The sidewalk shed shall be designed such that an alternative load path is provided for each vertical member so that the loss of a vertical member will not result in the failure, global or localized, of the shed.\n\tExceptions:  This requirement is not required where:\n1. Vertical members are adequately protected by bollards, guardwalls, vehicle arrest systems, or similar permanent elements installed in accordance with the requirements of the Department of Transportation.\n2. Vertical members are protected from vehicular traffic by a Class I bike lane or similar.\n3. Vertical members that are located within 36 inches (914 mm) from a roadway or parking lane are securely affixed within a planter capable of sustaining a vehicular impact.
