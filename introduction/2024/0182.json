  "Summary": "The Administrative Code requires the Commissioner of the Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) to purchase light-duty and medium-duty vehicles that achieve the highest fuel economy. DCAS can satisfy this requirement by purchasing vehicles that run on alternative fuels. However, the definition of “alternative fuel” does not include renewable natural gas as an option. The proposed legislation would amend the definition of alternative fuel in § 24-163.1 to include “biomethane or renewable natural gas.” The proposed legislation would further define the term “biomethane or renewable natural gas.”",
