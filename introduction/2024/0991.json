The licensee may seek review by the commissioner of the determination that the licensee has not submitted such proof within fifteen days of receiving written notification of such determination.\n      f. Neither the existence of service disruptions as defined in section 20-850 nor any remedied violations pursuant to section 20-851 shall constitute a basis for the commissioner to fail to approve, deny, suspend, revoke or fail to renew a license hereunder.\n      � 20-565.3 Display of license; facilities and inspections. a.

An occupied guest room must be cleaned, and trash must be removed daily unless the guest affirmatively declines such services for such day.  Hotels may not impose or collect any fee or charge for daily room cleaning nor offer any discount or incentive to forgo daily room cleaning.  \n      d. Prohibition against short duration bookings. A hotel, other than an airport hotel, may not book guest rooms for durations less than 4 hours.\n      e. Prohibition against facilitating human trafficking. A hotel may not  permit its premises to be used for the purposes of human trafficking.\n      � 20-565.5 Direct employment a. Direct employment required for core employees.

Hotel operators must submit the certificate of training to the commissioner within 90 days of employment.\n      c. Contracting to any third parties for core employees, including staffing agencies or other contractors or subcontractors, is not permitted except that a hotel owner may retain a single manager to manage all hotel operations involving core employees at a hotel on the hotel owner's behalf, which includes employment of core employees of the hotel by the hotel operator. Where a hotel owner retains a manager in accordance with this subsection, a hotel owner need not be a direct employer of core employees.\n      d.  Subdivisions a and c of this section shall not invalidate any agreement of a fixed duration between a hotel and contractor or subcontractor which agreement was in effect and enforceable as of September 18, 2024, for the duration of such agreement. Any contractor or subcontractor with such agreement shall, within thirty days after the effective date of this local law, notify all of its affected employees of the duration of the agreement and that, in accordance with 22-510, upon the termination of the agreement such employees shall be offered employment by the hotel operator.  Such notice shall be in addition to any notices required by paragraph 1 of subdivision b of section 22-510. In accordance with section 22-510, any contractor or subcontractor without such agreement shall notify all of its affected employees that they must be offered employment by the hotel operator no less than fifteen days before the effective date of this local law.\n      � 20-565.6 Panic buttons. a.

Such information shall be provided in each language spoken by ten or more hotel employees with limited English proficiency.\n      � 20-565.8 Retaliatory actions by hotels; prohibition. a. A hotel operator shall not take any retaliatory action against a hotel employee, whether or not within the scope of the hotel employee's job duties, because such employee does any of the following:\n      1. discloses, or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public body any specific activity, policy, or practice of the hotel operator that the employee reasonably and in good faith believes is in violation of this chapter or that the employee reasonably and in good faith believes poses a substantial and specific danger to the public health or safety; or\n      2. provides information to, or testifies before, any public body conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any such activity, policy, or practice by such hotel operator; or\n      3. objects to, or refuses to participate in any such activity, policy, or practice provided that the hotel employee has a reasonable, good faith belief that such activity, policy or practice subjects the employee to unusually dangerous conditions which are not normally part of the employee's job.\n      b. Any person alleging a violation of the provisions of this section may bring a civil action, in accordance with applicable law, in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n      c. Such court may order compensatory, injunctive and declaratory relief, and reasonable attorney's fees.\n      d. A civil action under this section shall be commenced within six months of the date the person knew or should have known of the alleged violation.\n      e. Any person filing a civil action shall simultaneously serve notice of such action and a copy of the complaint upon the department. Failure to so serve a notice does not adversely affect any person's cause of action.\n      � 20-565.9 Penalties. a. A licensee who violates or causes another person to violate a provision of this subchapter or any rule promulgated pursuant to such subchapter, in addition to any other applicable penalties provided in this title, shall be subject to a civil penalty as follows:\n      1. for the first violation, a civil penalty of $500;\n      2. for the second violation issued for the same offense within a period of two years of the date of the first violation, a civil penalty of $1,000;\n      3. for the third violation issued for the same offense within a period of two years of the date of the first violation, a civil penalty of $2,500; and\n      4. for the fourth and any subsequent violations issued for the same offense within a period of two years of the date of the first violation, a civil penalty of $5,000.\n      b.

The commissioner shall promulgate such rules as the commissioner deems necessary to reasonably effectuate the provisions of this subchapter.  \n      � 20-565.11 Severability. If any portion of this local law is, for any reason, declared unconstitutional or invalid, in whole or in part, by any court of competent jurisdiction such portion shall be deemed severable, and such unconstitutionality or invalidity shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this local law, which remaining portions shall continue in full force and effect.  \n      � 2.
