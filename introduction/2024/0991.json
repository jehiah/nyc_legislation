  "Summary": "This bill would require hotels to obtain a license in order to operate their business in the City. The application term would be one year, and there would be an annual fee of $200. Large hotels would be required to maintain continuous front desk coverage and have at least one security guard. All hotels would be required to maintain the cleanliness of each guest room. The licensee would be required to directly employ all core and critical employees, who would be subject to safety trainings. The department of consumer and worker protection could refuse to issue or renew a license, or suspend or revoke a license if the hotel violates the conditions of the license. Hotels that violate the license conditions would be subject to civil penalties.",
