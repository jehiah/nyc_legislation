  "Summary": "This bill would require the Commissioner of Youth and Community Development, in collaboration with the Director of the Mayor’s Office for Neighborhood Safety and the Prevention of Gun Violence, to study in-person altercations among individuals under 24 years of age who attend programs funded by the Department of Youth and Community Development. The Commissioner would be required to submit a report on the findings of the study to the Speaker of the Council and the Mayor. The report would have to include details of each altercation, details of any relevant activity on online platforms that led to the altercation, and whether a city agency responded to the altercation. The report would also have to include strategies the city can use to monitor the online activity of individuals under 24 years of age and to counsel these individuals on their online activity in order to prevent these kinds of altercations.",
