  "Summary": "This bill would double the maximum allowable civil penalties for certain violations of the Fair Work Week Law. Employers that violate the Fair Work Week Law for a second time within two years after a first violation could receive a civil penalty of up to $1,500 instead of $750, and for further violations, $2,000 instead of $1,000. The bill would also raise allowable civil penalties in civil actions for a pattern and practice of violations of the Fair Work Week Law to $30,000 from $15,000. Further, the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection may direct the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to suspend, revoke, deny or refuse to renew a food service establishment permit for employers that: 1) have not satisfied a fine or civil penalty for violating the Fair Work Week Law or the Earned Safe and Sick Time Act; 2) a court has found the employer has engaged in a pattern or practice of violations of the Fair Work Week Law or the Earned Safe and Sick Time Act; or 3) the employer has been ordered to pay an aggregate of $500,000 or more in penalties or monetary relief for violations of the Fair Work Week Law or the Earned Safe and Sick Time Act in a three-year period. This bill would also entitle employees of employers whose food service establishment permits are suspended are revoked to receive a severance for the first 14 days.",
