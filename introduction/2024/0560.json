  "Summary": "This bill would prohibit the use of gas-powered leaf blowers before noon on weekends, limit the permissible decibel level of such leaf blowers, and make it unlawful to distribute, sell or offer for sale any gas-powered leaf blower that exceeds the maximum decibel limit of 65 dB(A).  The bill would also provide for civil penalties of not more than $200 for a first violation and a civil penalty of no less than $200 nor more than $1,000 for two more violations within a two-year period.",
