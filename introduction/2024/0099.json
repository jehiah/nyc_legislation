  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation (DOT) to establish overnight parking areas in industrial business zones (IBZ) for commercial vehicles. Between 8:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., only commercial vehicles would be permitted to park in such overnight parking areas. Prior to establishing such an overnight parking area, DOT would be required to consult with the community boards representing the IBZ. The bill would also require DOT to conduct outreach to commercial entities in the area, as well as truck drivers operating in the City, to inform them of these new areas, and would require annual reporting by DOT on the effectiveness of these parking areas in reducing the amount of improperly parked commercial vehicles.",
