  "Summary": "This bill requires the Department of Transportation (DOT) to establish overnight parking areas in industrial business zones (IBZ) for commercial vehicles. These parking areas will be available only for commercial vehicles, and will be active for at least 10 continuous hours overnight and will be inactive between 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. Prior to establishing such an overnight parking area, DOT will be required to provide notice to the community boards and council members representing the IBZ, and will be required to discuss with those persons if requested to do so. The bill also requires DOT to conduct outreach to commercial entities in the area, as well as truck drivers operating in the City, to inform them of these new areas, and requires annual reporting by DOT on these overnight parking areas. This program will expire after five years.",
