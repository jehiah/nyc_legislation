The bill sets forth three specific prohibitions relating to decorum. The bill would also require the Commissioner or agency head to establish a complaint intake and referral mechanism and inform the public of the rules and the complaint intake and referral mechanism. The rules would not apply to social media accounts used by the offices of elected officials or those associated with online aliases used by law enforcement.",
