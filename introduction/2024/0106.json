  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation (DOT) to impose additional penalties on commercial, manufacturing, and industrial establishments that park motor vehicles on sidewalks in M1 zoning districts. It would also require DOT to conduct a study on the installation of bollards in M1 zoning districts to prevent parking and then install the bollards based on the study’s findings. DOT would also be required to submit reports on the enhanced penalties imposed for such sidewalk parking violations and a report on the study to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council and post the reports on its website.",
