  "Summary": "This bill would provide authorizations for, and place restrictions on, any Department of Sanitation (DSNY) program requiring residential buildings to place refuse in stationary, on-street containers (SOSCs). Specifically, DSNY would only be permitted to require buildings with 10 or more units to use SOSCs, although smaller buildings could be required to share SOSCs. Any building with 10 or more units that uses an SOSC would be required to provide its employees with relevant training and personal protective equipment. The bill would authorize DSNY to impose an annual fee of up to $55 per unit on buildings with 10 or more units that use SOSCs, although this fee would need to be waived for certain affordable housing developments, and the bill would prohibit unpaid fees from becoming a lien or accruing interest. Violations of the program rules would be enforceable via civil penalties.",
