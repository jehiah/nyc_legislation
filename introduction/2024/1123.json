  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Sanitation (“DSNY”) to establish a program requiring all residential buildings with 10 or more dwelling units to place residential waste in stationary on-street containers provided by DSNY by June 1, 2032. Buildings with 10-30 units would be allowed to opt out of the program if they comply with alternative containerization requirements established by DSNY by rule. DSNY would be permitted to charge property owners a fee of up to $55 per dwelling unit for maintenance and other costs related to such containers, and would be required to discount fees for Mitchell-Lama developments.",
