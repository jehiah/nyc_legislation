  "Summary": "This bill would require the New York City Department for the Aging (DFTA) to provide information in paper form regarding older adult workforce programs administered by DFTA to all contracted older adult centers and clients of all contracted providers. This bill would also require that DFTA update its existing know-your-rights pamphlet for older adults to include information and resources regarding employment opportunities, volunteer opportunities, and workforce program opportunities. The pamphlet would also include information to assist older adults in identifying and addressing employment discrimination, as well as the name, address, contact information, and website of relevant government agencies or community-based organizations that an older adult may contact to obtain additional information about issues regarding employment discrimination.",
