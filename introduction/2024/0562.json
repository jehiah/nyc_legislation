  "Summary": "This bill would require development projects that go through the Uniform Land Use Review Process (often called UPLURP), and which require environmental impact statements, to undergo additional review by the Departments of Education, Environmental Protection, Parks and Recreation, Sanitation, and Transportation, as well as the Police and Fire Departments. These agencies would evaluate current levels of city service in the surrounding area, and a plan to address any impact from the development project on that level of city service. These reports would be submitted to the applicable council members, borough president, and community board.",
