  "Summary": "This bill would require the Mayor’s Office for Neighborhood Safety and the Prevention of Gun Violence (the “Office”) to publish and maintain on its website information about the service provider organizations contracted with the Office to serve each neighborhood under New York City’s (the “City”) Crisis Management System (CMS), and to make publicly available on its website the criteria used to determine the geographic area a service provider is contracted to serve, including an explanation of how such service provider is specifically equipped to serve such area. The bill would also require that once a service provider organization is selected to serve a geographic area, that all relevant Council Members and community boards representing such area, and all relevant local New York Police Department (NYPD) precincts, be sent a letter providing details about the organization designated to cover such area, along with the contact information for such organization and details regarding the contractual obligations of such organization. The bill requires the Office to notify all relevant Council Members and community boards representing a geographic area, and all relevant NYPD precincts, when a contract for a service provider organization serving such geographic area is not renewed, and the reason for non-renewal. The bill would also require the Office to report annually on the progress being made toward the contractual goals agreed upon between the Office and each contracted service provider organization under the CMS.",
