  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to make rapid testing sites for sexually transmitted infections available in at least 4 boroughs of the City. The bill requires that 3 of such sites be operational within 1 year, and that all four sites be operational within 2 years. DOHMH would be required to determine the locations for such rapid testing services and report to the Council on the considerations that went into making such determinations. DOHMH would also be required to conduct an outreach and education campaign to inform communities of the locations and availability of rapid testing services, and would be required to report to the Council annually for 3 years on the availability of rapid testing services throughout the City.",
