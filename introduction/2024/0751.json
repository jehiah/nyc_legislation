  "Summary": "This bill would require an agency or office designated by the mayor, in consultation with the New York City Fire Department (FDNY), the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD), the Department of Buildings (DOB), and any other relevant agency, to develop and maintain a residential fire emergency response guide for individuals affected or displaced by a residential fire.  Such guide would include information about entities that assist individuals following residential fires, including information on emergency housing and aid. This bill would require FDNY to distribute the guide at the scene of residential fires using a quick response (QR) code posted on Department vehicles. Finally, the bill will require relevant agencies to make such guide available to individuals affected or displaced by a residential fire on location at post-fire inspections.",
