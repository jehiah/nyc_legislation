  "Summary": "This bill would require the New York City Fire Department (FDNY), in consultation with NYC Emergency Management and other relevant agencies, to develop a residential fire emergency response guide for residents affected or displaced by a fire. This guide would serve as a resource to educate fire-displaced residents of potential next steps to take following a residential fire. The guide would also provide information on city, state, and federal agencies and organizations that provide aid to individuals affected or displaced by a residential fire.  This bill would require FDNY to print and distribute the guide to affected residents at the scene of a residential fire and publish it on the department’s website in the designated citywide languages. Finally, the bill will require FDNY and relevant agencies to distribute the guide to individuals affected or displaced by a residential fire on location at post-fire inspections.",
