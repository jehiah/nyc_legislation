  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to design signs describing the rights of transgender patients, and to make such signs available to hospitals in the City. Such signs would include information on an individual’s right to be referred to by their preferred name, title, gender, and pronoun. This bill would also require DOHMH to coordinate with hospitals to identify the services offered by any such hospitals to meet the specific needs of transgender individuals, including gender-affirming health care, and would require DOHMH to provide guidance encouraging hospitals to post in a conspicuous location a list of any such services offered. DOHMH would also be required to post lists of such services and any updates on its website and on the 311 website.",
