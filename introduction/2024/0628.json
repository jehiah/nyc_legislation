  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to distribute signs on an individual’s right to be referred to by a preferred name, title, gender and pronoun to every hospital in the city. This bill would also require DOHMH to establish guidance to encourage hospitals to list and conspicuously post the transgender-specific services offered by each hospital, and would require DOHMH to post such guidance on its website. DOHMH would also be required to coordinate with hospitals to update such list of transgender-specific services, and post the list of services and any updates on the department’s website.",
