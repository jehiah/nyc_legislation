  "Summary": "This bill would authorize the Fire Department to have concurrent authority with the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection to enforce violations related to the prohibition of the sale, lease or rental of powered mobility devices and powered bicycles that fail to meet recognized safety standards. This bill would require that online sales of such devices display the certification of the accredited testing laboratory. This bill would require maintaining records that each device sold, leased or rented is certified. This bill would also increase penalties for illegal device sales, leases or rentals, which would include sealing the premises where such illegal devices are sold, leased or rented when there are repeated violations.",
