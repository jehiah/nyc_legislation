This bill includes certain exceptions to this prohibition, including when a ski mask is worn as part of a traditional holiday costume, as a garment for religious purposes, during the course of employment and for the purpose of ensuring the safety of the wearer, as part of a costume for a theatrical production, to protect the body from the elements while a person is participating in a winter sport, or as a form of expression protected by the First Amendment. Any person who violates this prohibition would be liable for a civil penalty of $250 that would be recoverable in a proceeding before the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings.",
