  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Section 19-175.2 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 78 for the year 2009, is amended to read as follows:\n      � 19-175.2 Notification of changes in parking restrictions or removal of parking spaces. a. Following any permanent change in parking restrictions posted by the department, the department shall post notice, in the affected areas, indicating the effective date of such change. An owner of a motor vehicle parked in the affected areas who receives a notice of a parking violation that occurred within [five] 5 days of posting of the notice of the parking restriction change shall have an affirmative defense that the vehicle of the owner was parked in compliance with the applicable parking restriction that was in effect prior to such change. Within [one] 1 business day of making a permanent change in parking restrictions, such change will be reflected on the website containing parking restrictions as required by section 19-175.1 of the code.\n      b. At least 10 days before the permanent full-time removal of any street parking space that will be used (i) as a designated parking space, as defined in subdivision a of section 19-175.5; (ii) for a bike share program, as defined in subdivision a of section 19-194; or (iii) for a bicycle corral for which a request was made by a business within 2 years of the date of the anticipated removal of such space, the department shall notify by electronic mail the council member representing the geographic area in which such parking space is located. Such notice shall, at a minimum, state the anticipated date of such removal, the location of such parking space, and the intended new use of such parking space. Such notice shall not be required where the department is otherwise required to provide notice about the project, including, but not limited to, as required pursuant to section 19-101.2, section 19-107.1, or section 19-157.\n      c. Before the department makes temporary parking restriction changes to conduct road repairs, it shall post notice of the effective date of such restrictions as soon as practicable. Such notice shall state that no notice of violations shall be issued for violations of such temporary parking restrictions and that if an owner's motor vehicle is missing from the affected streets, the motor vehicle may have been towed and the motor vehicle owner should contact the local police precinct for information about the location of such motor vehicle.\n      [c.] d. Following the issuance by the office of the mayor of a permit that authorizes filming [and/or] or related activity and that provides special parking privileges or the temporary suspension of parking restrictions, the party to whom the permit is issued shall post notice of such parking restriction changes immediately in the affected areas. Such notice shall, at a minimum, state the temporary change in the parking restrictions, the date on which such change will take effect, that no notice of violations shall be issued for violations of the temporary parking restrictions, and that if an owner's motor vehicle is missing from the affected streets, the motor vehicle may have been towed and the motor vehicle owner should contact the local police precinct for information about the location of such motor vehicle.\n      [d.] e.
