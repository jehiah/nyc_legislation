  "Summary": "This bill would require the commissioner of consumer and worker protection (commissioner) to establish and maintain an online, publicly available database that compiles information related to workplace fatalities that occur in New York City. To facilitate maintenance of such database, this bill would require the chief medical examiner to deliver to the commissioner reports of deaths that, in the chief medical examiner’s judgment, occur as the result of a work-related fatal injury in the workplace. This bill would also require direct employers, contractors, and subcontractors to provide the commissioner with additional information in relation to such deaths. A failure to report such information would be punishable by a civil penalty of no less than $1,000 and no more than $2,500 for each violation.",
