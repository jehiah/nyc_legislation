  "Summary": "This bill would require the Commissioner of the Department of Social Services or another commissioner designated by the mayor to develop a voluntary survey of individuals exiting the shelter and migrant re-ticketing systems. The survey would elicit information related to the immediate destinations of individuals exiting locations offering shelter and migrant re-ticketing services. Case managers and onsite staff at locations providing shelter and migrant re-ticketing services would administer the survey in the best language of individuals taking the survey. The commissioner would submit to the mayor and the Council an annual report regarding the anonymized, aggregated survey results.",
