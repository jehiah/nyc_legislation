  "Summary": "This bill would require expansion of the foster youth experience survey that the Administration for Children’s Services (ACS) is required to distribute annually to foster youth to additionally include questions about the treatment of foster youth by ACS and foster care provider employees, and questions about the experiences of foster youth related to their gender expression, gender identity, sex characteristics, and sexual orientation. The bill would also require ACS to allow foster youth to express any additional feedback about their experiences.",
