  "Summary": "This bill would allow a business entity registered by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene as a tobacco bar to seek the transfer of its registration, as well as a one-time transfer of its tobacco retail dealer license, upon a showing of financial hardship and that registration for a new location is warranted, to operate within the same or a different community district.",

Subdivision c of section 17-513.1 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\n       c. Any entity who in good faith believes itself to be a tobacco bar shall have one hundred eighty days from the effective date of the local law that added this section to apply to the department of health and mental hygiene for registration as a tobacco bar. During the period of time from the effective date of the local law which added this section until the expiration of one hundred eighty days, no provision of the local law that added this section, except for the provisions of this section, shall apply to such entity, but all provisions of local law 5 for the year 1995 shall continue to apply to such entity. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, an entity that operated as a tobacco bar prior to the effective date of the local law that added this section, and was subsequently registered as such with the department of health and mental hygiene pursuant to this subdivision and seeks to resume operation as such, may seek the transfer and reinstatement of its registration as a tobacco bar to a new location upon a sufficient demonstration of financial hardship. Upon a determination by the commissioner of health and mental hygiene that financial hardship exists and registration for a new location is warranted, and provided that such proposed new location is wholly occupied by the owner of such location or by no more than one commercial tenant, the commissioner shall register the new location as a tobacco bar provided that such entity resumes operation as a tobacco bar as defined in this chapter.\n      � 2.
