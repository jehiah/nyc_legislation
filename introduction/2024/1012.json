  "Summary": "This bill would require the City to implement and maintain a comprehensive digital procurement and contract management system. The system would need to, among other things, provide a centralized web portal for vendor information, allow electronic submission and evaluation of bids, and enable vendor invoice processing. The City Chief Procurement Officer (CCPO) would be required to procure a separate quality assurance contract when implementing such a system to include regular testing of system functionality and performance. The CCPO would also be responsible for implementing and maintaining such system and conducting reviews every six months to ensure the system remains up-to-date.",
