  "Summary": "This bill would require dealers in firearms, rifles, and shotguns to display a warning sign where the firearms, rifles, or shotguns are displayed or where they are transferred to the purchaser. The warning sign would include the following message: “A firearm in the home significantly increases the risk of suicide, homicide, death during domestic disputes, and unintentional deaths to children, household members and others. If you or a loved one is experiencing distress or depression, call the Mobile Crisis Team at 1-888-NYC WELL (1-888-692-9355) or the National Suicide Hotline at 988.” Failure to display the sign would be a violation punishable by a fine of not more than $5,000. In addition, the bill would require that graphic images depicting the nature of such risks be posted adjacent to the warning sign. The Department of Health and Mental Hygiene would design and disseminate the graphic images and any rules for posting them.",
