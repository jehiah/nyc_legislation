  "Summary": "The New York State Penal Law requires gun dealers and licensing officers to display written warnings about the risks associated with accessing firearms. This bill would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to design graphic images to accompany the written warnings required by state law. Gun dealers and licensing officers would be responsible for displaying or disseminating such graphic images alongside the written warnings. DOHMH would also publish the graphic images on their website. Failure to display or disseminate the graphic images would result in a violation punishable by a civil penalty in the amount of $5,000 for the first offense and $10,000 for a second offense in a 12-month period.",
