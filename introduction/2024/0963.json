  "Summary": "This bill would prohibit the Department of Correction (“DOC”) from recording voice communications or electronic communications, such as text messages and emails, made by or to individuals in DOC custody, except pursuant to a warrant or with the express consent of one party to such communication. This bill would also prohibit DOC from collecting or purchasing location data of individuals initiating or receiving voice or electronic communications from individuals in DOC custody. This bill would also prohibit DOC from collecting or purchasing biometric voice information, such as voiceprints, from individuals in DOC custody or individuals initiating or receiving voice or electronic communications from individuals in DOC custody. Finally, this bill would create a private right of action for anyone whose voice or electronic communications were unlawfully recorded, monitored, or otherwise surveilled or whose location data or biometric voice information was unlawfully collected, retained, or disclosed.",
