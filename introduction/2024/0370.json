  "Summary": "This bill would require officers and employees of City contractors and subcontractors with contracts valued in excess of $100,000 to report conflicts of interest or other wrongdoing by any officer or employee of such contractor or subcontractor that concerns City contracts to the Department of Investigation (DOI) or other City officials. The bill would clarify that the DOI and other officials are required to make reasonable efforts to protect the confidentiality of the officer or employee making the report. Additionally, officers and employees of City contractors and subcontractors with City contracts valued in excess of $100,000 would be required to cooperate with DOI investigations related to City contracts. If a contracting agency determines that there has been a violation of the reporting and cooperation requirements, the contracting agency would be required to take such action as it deems appropriate and consistent with the remedies available under the contract or subcontract.",
