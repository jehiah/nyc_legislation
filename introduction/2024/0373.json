  "Summary": "This bill would permit taxicab owners, whose vehicles are not currently scheduled to be converted to wheelchair accessible vehicles at the next scheduled retirement date, to apply to the Taxi and Limousine Commission for a vehicle retirement extension of 12 months during the Disaster Emergency issued by the State of New York in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. This bill would also permit such taxicab owners to apply for a vehicle retirement extension of up to 12 additional months if an owner can demonstrate an economic or other personal hardship that the commission determines would create an undue burden upon the owner if the extension were not granted. Taxicab owners whose vehicles are currently scheduled to be converted to wheelchair accessible vehicles at the next scheduled retirement date may apply to the Taxi and Limousine Commission for a vehicle retirement extension of 6 months during the Disaster Emergency issued by the State of New York in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic.",
