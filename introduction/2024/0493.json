  "Summary": "This bill would require that, prior to installing a neighborhood loading zone, the Department of Transportation (DOT) post physical notices regarding the installation on the block of the proposed neighborhood loading zone and nearby blocks. The bill would also require notification of the affected Council Member; affected community board; property owners, community-based organizations, and members of the public who have requested to be notified of installation; and others DOT deems appropriate. The bill would additionally require DOT to provide a 30-day comment period, during which the public would be able to submit feedback to DOT about the proposed neighborhood loading zone. DOT would be required to consider comments and would have the discretion to implement corresponding changes to its installation plan. Finally, the bill would require DOT to publish the location of new neighborhood loading zones online within 5 days of their installation.",
