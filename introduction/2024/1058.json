  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection 1. The department of parks and recreation, in consultation with the department of education, shall conduct a feasibility study to determine the level of interest of New York city public high school students in being trained and certified as lifeguards, in order to facilitate and encourage such students to seek employment as lifeguards at beaches and pools under the jurisdiction of the department of parks and recreation during the bathing season. Such study shall be submitted to the mayor and the speaker of the council by no later than July 1, 2025. Such study shall include, but not be limited to: \n      1.

An analysis on what the current capacity is for the department of parks and recreation or the department of education to provide lifeguard training and certification to New York city public high school students and what additional resources would be needed to provide such training or certification to a greater numbers of such students as well as to high school students who do not attend public high schools;   \n      3. Information on not for profit organizations that the department of parks and recreation or the department of education engages with, or could engage with, in order to provide additional lifeguard training and certification programs to New York city public high school students;\n      4. An analysis on the potential locations, whether it be City owned property or private property, where additional lifeguard training programs could occur;\n      5. An analysis on how other municipal jurisdictions throughout the United States recruit and train high school students as lifeguards for employment at municipal beaches and pools; and\n      6. Information regarding what outreach efforts the department of parks and recreation, the department of education, or any other relevant agency could engage in to attract high school students, regardless of where such students attend school, to seek lifeguard training and certification.\n      � 2.
