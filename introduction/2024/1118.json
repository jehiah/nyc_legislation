  "Summary": "This bill would update section 1109 of the Charter to reflect the creation of the Twelfth and Thirteenth Judicial Districts. Currently, section 1109 permits any supreme court justice “in the first, second or eleventh judicial district” to order a summary inquiry into alleged misconduct regarding the property, government, or affairs of the City. When the Legislature reassigned Bronx County to the Twelfth District and Richmond County to the Thirteenth District, it did not update section 1109 accordingly. This bill would make the necessary updates to section 1109 to clarify that justices in Bronx and Richmond Counties continue to be able to order summary inquiries.",
