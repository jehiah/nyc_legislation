  "Summary": "This bill would amend Local Law 145 of 2019, which established a task force to address policies related to the treatment and housing of transgender, gender nonconforming, non-binary, and intersex individuals in the custody of the Department of Correction. The bill would amend the minimum duration date of the task force to be one year after the issuance of the fifth annual task force report, require that the task force self-elect a chair, require a Speaker appointee instead of a Council appointee as a task force member, and provide for ways that the Department of Correction and Correctional Health Services must substantively participate in the task force. The task force would be required to elect a chair within 90 days of the effective date of this bill. This bill would also make various amendments to update and clarify language.",
