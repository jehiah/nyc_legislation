  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation (DOT) to install pedestrian lighting fixtures on no fewer than 300 commercial corridors per year, until the average level of illumination along the length of sidewalk on a block in each commercial corridor is at least 1 footcandle (11 lux). DOT would be required to consider certain factors in selecting such commercial corridors, and to the extent practicable, at least 250 of the selected commercial corridors must be contiguous to at least one other commercial corridor that either has been selected for installation in the same year, or that already has sufficient lighting. This bill would also require DOT to submit an annual report regarding installations completed during the preceding calendar year.",
