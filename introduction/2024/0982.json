  "Summary": "This bill would require employers with more than 25 employees working in the City to report to the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) information relating to their employees in order to improve wage transparency. The information required to be reported includes, for each employee: salary and wages earned for the previous calendar year; the month and year the employee was hired; job title; gender; race and ethnicity; birth year; the borough in which the employee works; whether the employee is a member of a labor union; whether the employee works more than 35 hours per week, less than 35 hours per week, or on a seasonal or temporary basis; and whether the employee is a manager. The first report would be due on February 1, 2025, and subsequent reports would be required annually thereafter. Employers covered by this bill would also have to submit a digital affirmation to DCWP every three years, which certifies the employer’s compliance with federal, state, and local equal pay laws.",
