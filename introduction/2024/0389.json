  "Summary": "This bill would create a 5 year pilot program during which the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) would install real-time air quality monitors in residential buildings. Participation in the pilot program would be voluntary, except that buildings receiving city financial assistance would be required to participate. Upon the conclusion of the program, DOHMH, in collaboration with the Department of Buildings (DOB), the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), and any other relevant agency, would be required to issue a report summarizing the data gathered and make recommendations to improve air quality in residential buildings. DOHMH, DOB and DEP would also be permitted to make rules regarding the improvement of air quality in residential buildings.",
