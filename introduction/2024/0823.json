  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation to conduct a one-time study to evaluate the feasibility of speed bumps as a means of preventing electric bicycles from speeding in bicycle lanes, to recommend alternative speed reducing measures if speed bumps are impracticable, and to identify locations where collisions involving electric bicycles occur at a higher frequency.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Bicycle with electric assist speed reduction study. a. Definitions. For the purposes of this local law, the following terms have the following meanings:\n      Bicycle with electric assist. The term \"bicycle with electric assist\" means a bicycle with electric assist as defined in section 102-c of the vehicle and traffic law.\n      Speed bump. The term \"speed bump\" means a continuously raised area extending transversely across the entirety of the roadway, from one curb to the other, which is installed and designed for the purpose of slowing traffic.\n      Speed reducing measure. The term \"speed reducing measure\" means a method other than speed bumps, designed for the purpose of slowing traffic, including but not limited to speed cushions, changes in road texture, and raised intersections. \n      b.

Determine the feasibility of installing speed bumps in bicycle lanes of different typologies to slow traffic from bicycles with electric assist, to speeds no greater than 20 miles per hour for class one and two bicycles with electric assist and no greater than 25 miles per hour for class three bicycles with electric assist, in order to reduce the number of accidents involving bicycles with electric assist that result in serious injury or fatality;\n      2. Consider the impact of speed bumps on vehicles other than bicycles with electric assist including but not limited to bicycles, buses, and emergency vehicles;\n      3. Recommend alternative speed reducing measures for bicycles with electric assist if the department of transportation determines that the installation of speed bumps is not feasible pursuant to paragraph 1 of subdivision b of this section; and,\n      4. Solicit input from the public, and collect publicly available data, to identify locations where accidents involving bicycles with electric assist frequently occur.\n      � 2.
