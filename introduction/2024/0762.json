  "Summary": "The current cap on fees that a third-party delivery service may charge a restaurant for the use of their service is 15% for delivery, 3% for credit card processing, and 5% for any other fees – these percentages are calculated per order. This bill would allow third-party delivery services to charge a restaurant an additional 20% for enhanced services. It would only permit the use of the enhanced service fee, however, if the delivery service offers the option to purchase a basic service at a cost no higher than the current fee limits, and if such basic service includes the option to obtain delivery services and be listed and discoverable on the third-party platform. This bill would require third-party delivery services to notify restaurants that have an existing agreement with such service about the new services offered, the caps on fees, and any changes that would be made to the service fees. It would also require third-party delivery services to prepare monthly transaction statements that include an itemized list of fees charged to restaurants. This bill would also restrict third-party food delivery services from purchasing the name of a restaurant for purposes of internet advertising. This bill would allow restaurants to include marketing materials in orders made through third-party food delivery services, and it would not prohibit restaurants from charging different prices for items ordered through a third-party food delivery service. This bill would also update the reporting requirements regarding the fee caps, requiring the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection to report on the effect of the fee caps and the number of violations issued under this subchapter.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n      Section 1. The definition of \"delivery fee\" in section 20-563 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 100 for the year 2021, is amended to read as follows: \n      Delivery fee. The term \"delivery fee\" means a fee charged by a third-party food delivery service for providing a food service establishment with a service that delivers food from such establishment to customers located within at least 1 mile of such food service establishment. [The term does not include any other fee that may be charged by a third-party food delivery service to a food service establishment, such as fees for listing or advertising the food service establishment on the third-party food delivery platform or fees related to processing the online order.]\n      � 2.
