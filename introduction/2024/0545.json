  "Summary": "This bill would increase the maximum fees for towing and storage of vehicles in certain circumstances when the towing company is not chosen by the vehicle owner. The bill would also set a higher rate for storage and towing of vehicles registered at a weight of more than 10,000 pounds. The fees would generally be $225 for towing and $40 per day for storage of vehicles that weigh 10,000 pounds or less, and $700 for towing and $250 per day for storage of vehicles that weigh more than 10,000 pounds. Additional mileage fees would also apply in certain circumstances.",

Where more than one towing company has been placed on a list of towing companies authorized to remove vehicles in a particular zone, the police department shall summon towing companies from such list on a rotating basis. Any towing company approved for participation in such program after such lists are initially established shall be placed on any such list at the point immediately preceding the last towing company summoned by the police department pursuant to this section. Such lists shall be available at the department for public inspection.\n      � 9.

During the period commencing on the eighth day after the vehicle is removed to such storage facility and ending on the thirtieth day after such removal, such towing company shall transfer any vehicle which has not been claimed into the custody of the police department property clerk.\n          2. An evidence vehicle shall be removed by a towing company participating in the rotation tow program when directed to do so by the police department. Such vehicle shall be towed to a location designated by a police officer.\n          3. No tow truck operator shall knowingly remove a vehicle suspected of having been stolen or abandoned or an evidence vehicle without authorization by the police department. No tow truck operator shall knowingly remove a vehicle blocking a private driveway subject to removal pursuant to section 19-169 [of the code] except as authorized in such section. No tow truck operator shall knowingly remove a vehicle with certain alarm devices subject to removal pursuant to section [24-221 of the code] 24-240 except as authorized in such section.\n      � 10.
