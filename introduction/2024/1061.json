  "Summary": "This bill would amend the Department of Correction’s semi-annual reports on alleged incidents and investigations of sexual harassment and abuse to require a unique identification number for each alleged incident, a unique identification number for each alleged victim, and a data dictionary for each report. It would also require the Department to provide a justification for not reporting any substantiated allegations to a District Attorney’s office. Additionally, the Commissioner would be required to review the information collected and report annually on any updates made to DOC’s prevention, detection and response policies concerning sexual harassment and abuse of people in custody.",
