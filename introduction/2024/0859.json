Section 20-1523 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by a local law for the year 2025 amending the administrative code of the city of New York, relating to protections for contracted delivery workers, as proposed in introduction number 1133, is amended to read as follows:\n      � 20-1523 Payments to workers. \n      a. A delivery service shall not charge or impose any fee on a contracted delivery worker retained by such service for the use of any form of payment selected by such service to pay such worker for work performed.\n      b. 1. A delivery service shall pay a contracted delivery worker retained by such service for work performed no less frequently than once [a week] per pay period. A delivery service shall pay all compensation, including any gratuity, owed to such contracted delivery worker for a pay period no later than 7 calendar days after the date on which such pay period ends.\n      2. It shall be unlawful for a delivery service or any person to fail to distribute to a contracted delivery worker any portion of any gratuity.\n      c. 1. No later than 7 calendar days after the date on which such pay period ended, a delivery service shall provide each contracted delivery worker retained by such service a written statement, in a form and manner the department may specify by rule, of all compensation owed to such contracted delivery worker for such pay period. Such statement shall set forth the gross compensation and net compensation of such contracted delivery worker for such pay period. Such statement shall also itemize all compensation and any permissible deductions or allowances taken during such pay period, including, in a form the department may specify by rule, a separate line item for:\n      (a) The minimum payment required pursuant to section 20-1522 or any rule promulgated thereunder;\n      (b) Any bonus or other monetary payment, including any such bonus or payment that may contribute to minimum payment required pursuant to section 20-1522 or any rule promulgated thereunder;\n      (c) Gratuities;\n      (d) Any monetary payment that may not, pursuant to section 20-1522 or any rule promulgated thereunder, contribute to minimum payments required by such section or any such rule; \n      (e) Any deduction or allowance taken, if any; and\n      (f) Any additional information that the department determines by rule would enable a contracted delivery worker to understand the compensation owed to such worker by the delivery service, including any information necessary to contest any errors in the statement.\n      2. Such statement shall also demonstrate the method used and calculations made by a delivery service to determine the minimum payments made to a contracted delivery worker for the respective pay period.\n      3. A delivery service shall retain a copy of any statement required by this subdivision for a period of at least 3 years in a form and manner the department may specify by rule. During such 3 year period, a contracted delivery worker may request a copy of any such statement provided to such contracted delivery worker by a delivery service. Such delivery service shall provide such a copy no less than 3 business days following such request. \n      � 2.
