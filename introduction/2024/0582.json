  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (“DoITT”) to create a mobile application to support the efficient handling of 311 service requests by City employees. The mobile application would provide City employees assigned to handle 311 service requests with relevant information necessary to efficiently complete the work for the requests, and would indicate when requests have been completed. Other City agencies would provide assistance to DoITT as necessary in developing the mobile application.",
