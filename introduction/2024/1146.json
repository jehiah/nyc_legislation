  "Summary": "This bill would require the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to maintain a Newborn Home Visiting Program that offers free in-person and virtual visits from social workers, nurses, and lactation professionals to new parents during the first 12 weeks after a child’s birth. The program would be expanded over time to reach neighborhoods with significant health and socioeconomic disparities, known as priority neighborhoods. By December 1, 2028, the program must be available in 75 percent of priority neighborhoods, and by December 1, 2030, it must be available in all such neighborhoods. DOHMH would also be required to submit progress reports to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council in 2027, 2029, and 2031 detailing where the program is available by ZIP code and describing any challenges in implementation.",
