  "Summary": "This bill would require that the Mayor’s Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability conduct a study in consultation with the city Economic Development Corporation on transitioning all city ports to zero-emission port operations. The study would be required to evaluate whether such a transition can be completed by 2040, the technology and investments required to make such a transition, and whether any additional workforce development would be necessary to complete the transition. The study would also evaluate whether it would be possible to provide shore power to all commercial maritime vessels by 2027, as well as whether incentives can be provided for the use of low to zero-emission vessels. The office would be required to complete this study and publicly report on it within one year.",

The office, in consultation with the New York city economic development corporation, shall study the feasibility of transitioning all city ports to zero-emission port operations. The office shall invite the appropriate federal, state, and local agencies and authorities to participate and offer feedback. Such study shall also take into consideration the climate adaptation plan proposed pursuant to section 24-808 of the administrative code of the city of New York, the work of the New York city panel on climate change established pursuant to section 3-122 of the New York city charter, the comprehensive waterfront plan prepared pursuant to section 205 of the New York city charter, and the environmental justice plan and study required by sections 3-1003 and 3-1007 of the administrative code of the city of New York.

Evaluate whether it is possible for sufficient shore power to be provided to all commercial marine vessels by 2027; and\n      8. Identify any barriers to achieving sufficient shore power to all commercial marine vessels by 2027.\n      c. Report. Within 1 year of the effective date of this local law, the office shall report to the mayor and the speaker, and shall post conspicuously on the office's website, a report on the feasibility transitioning all city ports to zero-emission port operations, as described in subdivision b of this local law.\n      � 2.
