  "Summary": "This bill would update the Citizen’s Noise Complaint Program to require the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to create a standard for evidence of Noise Code violations that is collected by members of the public and submitted to DEP. It would also add certain construction noise violations to the list of violations that can be alleged by members of the public, and requires DEP to do outreach and education on how to adequately collect evidence of violations. DEP would be required to notify and inspect construction sites where 2 violations of the Noise Code have been reported within 24 hours. Finally, a notice to residents near construction sites must be posted that provides information regarding how to report unreasonable noise and how to serve a complaint.",
