  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Social Services to count any period of involuntary confinement, in a city jail, state prison, or residential mental health facility, in calculating the length of time an individual has been homeless for purposes of eligibility for supportive housing funded by New York City. The bill also requires that any period of involuntary confinement for 1 year or longer, for an individual who is likely to be homeless upon release, will satisfy the requirement for a minimum period of time that an individual must be homeless for city-funded supportive housing eligibility.",
