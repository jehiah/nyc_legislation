  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Sanitation to establish one or more organic waste composting facilities in each borough. Each borough’s facility or facilities would be required to have the cumulative capacity to process no fewer than 180,000 wet tons of organic waste annually. The bill would also require the Department, in establishing such facilities, to engage the local community regarding facility siting and facility employment opportunities, consider environmental justice factors, and consult the composting facility siting task force. The Department would also be required to maximize the use of minority- and women-owned business enterprise noncompetitive small purchases in the construction, operation, or maintenance of such organic waste composting facilities.",

The term \"source-separated organic waste\" means organic material found in both the residential and commercial waste streams that has been separated at the point of generation that is readily biodegradable and can be broken down into, or otherwise become part of, usable compost, including, but not limited to, food scraps, food processing waste, soiled or unrecyclable paper, plant trimmings, and yard waste as defined in section 16-303. Source-separated organic waste does not include disposable or compostable plastic food service ware and bags, animal mortalities, textiles, biosolids, sludge, or septage.\n      Uncontaminated.

In establishing a city-owned, operated, or contracted organic waste composting facility pursuant to this subdivision, the department shall:\n      (a) provide a forum for community engagement available to persons living within a half-mile radius of any possible organic waste composting facility site which is under consideration for selection, prior to the ultimate selection of such site and in addition to any other required review process; \n      (b) consult with the composting facility siting task force established by the two thousand and six solid waste management plan, or any successor entity, in selecting sites for new organic waste composting facilities; \n      (c) consider factors of environmental justice to ensure that environmental justice areas, as such terms are defined in section 3-1001, do not experience a disproportionate effect in the siting, construction, operation, or maintenance of any organic waste composting facility; and\n      (d) perform outreach to persons living within a half-mile radius of a selected site for any organic waste composting facility informing such persons of potential employment opportunities for the construction, operation, or maintenance of such facility.\n      3.
