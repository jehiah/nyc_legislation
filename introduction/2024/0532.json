  "Summary": "Local Law 2 of 2016 established a program whereby non-public schools are eligible to seek reimbursement from the City for costs related to employing security guards.  Currently, only non-public schools with more than 300 students are eligible to participate in the program. This proposed bill would expand the existing program to cover more schools and increase the annual spending cap that is included in the current law. First, the threshold of eligibility would be lowered to include schools with 150 or more students. Additionally, the program would be expanded to include certain charter schools that are not co-located in an existing public school building.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1.

Paragraph 1 of subdivision f of section 10-172 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 2 for the year 2016, is amended to read as follows:\n      1. one security guard at a qualifying nonpublic school that enrolls from [300] 150 to 499 students;\n      � 3.

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this [local law] section, the total annual amount of reimbursements authorized by this section shall be a maximum of [$19,800,000] $35,000,000 dollars per school year, which shall be adjusted annually by the administering agency, if such agency anticipates that such maximum will be reached in the subsequent one-year period, to reflect changes in the prevailing wage and supplements, the number of students attending qualifying nonpublic schools, or the number of qualifying nonpublic schools, provided that such reimbursements shall in no event exceed the amounts appropriated for implementation of this section. To the extent the administering agency anticipates that the amount requested for reimbursement will exceed the funds available, the administering agency shall reimburse for allowable costs on an equitable basis until such funds are exhausted.\n      � 4. Subdivision m of section 10-172 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 2 for the year 2016, is amended to read as follows:\n      m.

Section 10-172 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new subdivision n to read as follows:\n      n. Any qualifying non-public school that operates in more than one address shall be eligible for reimbursement for the allowable costs of a security guard to provide security services at each such address, provided that the eligibility requirements set forth in subdivision f are satisfied at each such address.\n      � 6.
