  "Summary": "Local Law 2 of 2016 established a program whereby non-public schools are eligible to seek reimbursement from the City for costs related to employing security guards.  Currently, only non-public schools with more than 300 students are eligible to participate in the program. This proposed bill would expand the existing program to cover more schools and increase the annual spending cap that is included in the current law. First, the threshold of eligibility would be lowered to include schools with 150 or more students. Additionally, the program would be expanded to include certain charter schools that are not co-located in an existing public school building.",
