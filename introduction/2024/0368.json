An occupant may request postponement of such an investigation during the state of emergency declared by the mayor in response to the 2019 novel coronavirus and for up to one year after such state of emergency is lifted; however, an owner is not relieved of the requirement to cause an investigation to be made absent such a request for postponement by an occupant.\n      � 2.
