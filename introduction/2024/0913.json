  "Summary": "This bill would require that any retailer that sells balloons constructed using metallic materials to attach a label to each balloon with a warning about the dangers of metallic balloons colliding with power lines and the retailer’s identifying information.

Any retailer that violates this law would be subject to a civil penalty of at least $100 for each balloon sold or offered for sale in violation, with a maximum total daily penalty of $2,000.",
