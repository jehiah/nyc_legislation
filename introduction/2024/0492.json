  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation (DOT) to investigate any complaint of illegal curb cuts within 30 days. If DOT finds a curb cut was illegally created, DOT would paint the curb cut green to indicate it is available for parking and require property owners to either obtain the required permits for the curb cut or restore it. If the property owner does not correct the illegal curb cut, DOT would be required to do so, recovering the cost from the property owner. Additionally, community boards would be notified of any applications for permits to create a curb cut within the community district.",
