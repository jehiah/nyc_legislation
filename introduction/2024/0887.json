  "Summary": "The proposed unconsolidated local law would require the Department of Parks and the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to conduct a study and pilot program concerning the use of cool pavement materials on parks, playgrounds, community centers, recreation centers and parking lot areas under the jurisdiction of Department of Parks.",
  "TextID": 77417,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\t\n\tSection 1. The department of parks and recreation shall undertake a pilot program on the use of cool pavement materials within the groundwater supply service area.  Such pilot program shall take place on interior park roadways, parking lots and sidewalk surfaces at city-owned community centers, recreation centers, parks and playgrounds including those playgrounds in proximity to or adjacent to schools that are under the jurisdiction of such department,  provided that such locations are not suitable for the use of permeable pavements. The pilot program shall include evaluation of the impact that pedestrian volume and susceptibility to heat island effects has on feasibility and desirability of using non-permeable cool pavement materials in such locations. The department shall consult with the department of environmental protection prior to choosing the locations for the pilot program.  Such pilot program shall commence upon the selection of suitable locations, but no later than June 1 of 2023.  The department of parks and recreation shall provide to the mayor and speaker of the council a report on such pilot program upon its conclusion.\n\t� 2.
