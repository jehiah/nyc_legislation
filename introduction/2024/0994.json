  "Summary": "This bill would require that from June 15 to September 15 building owners that are subject to minimum temperature requirements under local law maintain a maximum indoor temperature of 78°F when the outdoor air temperature is 82°F or higher. Owners without central cooling would have to install cooling systems within residential units. Leases must contain notice of the cooling requirements. All of the abovementioned requirements would be imposed four years after the bill’s effective date. Owners claiming undue hardship would be able to apply for additional time for compliance with the cooling requirements. Owners would have to carry out pre- and post-enforcement reporting to the city concerning compliance with the cooling requirements. The bill would impose separate civil penalties for violation of the cooling and notice requirements. Finally, the city would have to do outreach and education to tenants and owners on owner responsibilities under this bill.",

Subdivision (k) of section 27-2115 of the administrative code of the city of New York, paragraph (1) of such subdivision as amended by local law number 65 for the year 2011, subparagraph (i) of such paragraph as amended by local law number 71 for the year 2023, and paragraph 3 of such subdivision as amended by local law number 16 for the year 2011, is amended to read as follows:\n      (1) (i) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a person who violates section 27-2028, subdivision a of section 27-2029, paragraph 1 or 2 of subdivision b of section 27-2030, section 27-2031 or section 27-2032 [of this chapter] shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than three hundred fifty nor more than one thousand two hundred fifty dollars per day for each violation from and including the date the notice is affixed pursuant to paragraph [two] 2 of this subdivision until the date the violation is corrected, and not less than five hundred nor more than one thousand five hundred dollars per day for each subsequent violation [of such sections] at the same dwelling or multiple dwelling that occurs (i) in the case of section 27-2028, paragraph 2 of subdivision b of section 27-2030, section 27-2031 or section 27-2032, within two consecutive calendar years [or,]; (ii) in the case of subdivision a of section 27-2029, during two consecutive periods of October [first] 1 through May [thirty-first] 31; or (iii) in the case of paragraph 1 of subdivision b of section 27-2030, during two consecutive periods of June 15 through September 15. A person who violates subdivision b of section 27-2029 of this chapter shall be subject to a civil penalty of fifty dollars per day from and including the date the notice is affixed pursuant to paragraph [two] 2 of this subdivision until the date the violation is corrected but not less than two thousand dollars. There shall be a presumption that the condition constituting a violation continues after the affixing of the notice.\n      (ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (i) of this paragraph and section 27-2116 [of this chapter], the civil penalties set forth in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph shall be deemed satisfied for a first violation of section 27-2028, subdivision a of section 27-2029, paragraph 1 or paragraph 2 of subdivision b of section 27-2030, section 27-2031 or section 27-2032 [of this chapter] if a notice, in a form prescribed by the department, that such violation has been corrected by the owner or an agent or employee of the owner within twenty-four hours of the affixing of the notice of such violation pursuant to paragraph [two] 2 of this subdivision, and a payment of two hundred fifty dollars, are submitted to the department within ten days of affixing the notice of such violation. A person who submits a false notice of correction shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than two hundred fifty dollars for each false notice of correction, in addition to the other penalties herein provided. If the notice of correction and payment are not received within such ten-day period then the penalties set forth in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph shall be applicable to such violations and the department may commence a proceeding for an order to correct and to recover such penalties in accordance with this section and section 27-2116 [of this chapter]. A person who has violated section 27-2028, subdivision a of section 27-2029, paragraph 1 or paragraph 2 of subdivision b of section 27-2030, section 27-2031 or section 27-2032 [of this chapter] may allege as a defense or in mitigation of liability for civil penalties, compliance with the notice of correction and payment requirements of this subparagraph in any proceeding brought by the department seeking civil penalties under this subdivision. The process for submission of the notice of correction and payment set forth in this subparagraph shall not be available (i) if a violation of section 27-2028, paragraph 2 of subdivision b of section 27-2030, section 27-2031 or section 27-2032 [of this chapter] occurred at the same dwelling or multiple dwelling during the prior calendar year [or,]; (ii) in the case of subdivision a of section 27-2029 [of this chapter], if a violation of such subdivision occurred at the same dwelling or multiple dwelling during the prior period of October [first] 1 through May [thirty-first] 31; or (iii) in the case of paragraph 1 of subdivision b of section 27-2030, if a violation of such paragraph occurred at the same dwelling or multiple dwelling during the prior period of June 15 through September 15.\n      (iii) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, within five business days from the date of receipt of the notice of correction by the department, the department shall mail to the occupant of any dwelling unit for which such violation was issued notification that the owner has submitted a notice of correction for such violation. The notification to the occupant shall include information on when the violation was reportedly corrected and how the occupant may object to such notice of correction. In addition, the provisions of paragraphs 4 and 5 of subdivision f of this section shall also be applicable to a notice of correction submitted in compliance with subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph.\n      (iv) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a person who, after inspection by the department, is issued an immediately hazardous violation for a third or any subsequent violation of (i) section 27-2028, paragraph 2 of subdivision b of section 27-2030, section 27-2031 or section 27-2032 [of this chapter] at the same dwelling or multiple dwelling within the same calendar year [or, in the case of]; (ii) subdivision a of section 27-2029 [of this chapter,] at the same dwelling or multiple dwelling within the same period of October [first] 1 through May [thirty-first,] 31; or (iii) paragraph 1 of subdivision b of section 27-2030 at the same dwelling or multiple dwelling within the same period of June 15 through September 15 shall be subject to a fee of two hundred dollars for each inspection that results in the issuance of such violation as well as any civil penalties that may be due and payable for the violation, provided, however, that such fee shall not be applicable to inspections performed in a multiple dwelling that is included in the alternative enforcement program pursuant to article [ten] 10 of subchapter [five] 5 of this chapter. All fees that remain unpaid shall constitute a debt recoverable from the owner and a lien upon the premises, and upon the rents and other income thereof. The provisions of article [eight] 8 of subchapter [five] 5 of this chapter shall govern the effect and enforcement of such debt and lien.\n      (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the department shall serve a notice upon the owner, his or her agent or other person responsible for the correction of violations by affixing such notice in a conspicuous place on the premises. The notice shall identify the condition constituting the violation, the provision of law applicable thereto, the date the violation was reported and set the penalty attendant thereto.\n      (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the owner shall be responsible for the correction of all violations placed pursuant to article [eight] 8 of subchapter [two] 2 of this code, but in an action for civil penalties pursuant to this article may in defense or mitigation of such owner's liability for civil penalties show:\n      (i) That the condition which constitutes the violation did not exist at the time the violation was placed; or\n      (ii) That he or she began to correct the condition which constitutes the violation promptly upon discovering it but that full correction could not be completed expeditiously because of technical difficulties, inability to obtain necessary materials, funds or labor, or inability to gain access to the dwelling unit wherein the violation occurs, or such other portion of the building as might be necessary to make the repair; or\n      (iii) That he or she was unable to obtain a permit or license necessary to correct the violation, provided that diligent and prompt application was made therefor; or\n      (iv) That the violation giving rise to the action was caused by the act or negligence, neglect or abuse of another not in the employ or subject to the direction of the owner; or\n      (v) That in addition to any other defense or mitigation set forth in subparagraphs (i) through (iv) of this paragraph, with respect to an owner who may be subject to the penalty of not less than five hundred nor more than one thousand dollars per day with respect to a subsequent violation pursuant to paragraph [one] 1 of this subdivision, documentation of prompt and diligent efforts to correct the conditions that gave rise to an initial violation and that such conditions were corrected. Where demonstrated, such subsequent violation shall be treated as though it was an initial violation. However, this defense or mitigation may not be asserted or demonstrated where the initial and subsequent violations occurred (i) in the case of violations of section 27-2028, paragraph 2 of subdivision b of section 27-2030, section 27-2031 or section 27-2032, in the same calendar year [or,]; (ii) in the case of violations of subdivision a of section 27-2029, during the same period of October [first] 1 through May [thirty-first] 31; or (iii) in the case of violations of paragraph 1 of subdivision b of section 27-2030, during the same period of June 15 through September 15.\n      Where the aforesaid allegations are made by way of mitigation of penalties, the owner shall show, by competent proof, pertinent financial data, and efforts made to obtain necessary materials, funds or labor or to gain access, or to obtain a permit or license and such other evidence as the court may require.\n      If the court finds that sufficient mitigating circumstances exist, it may remit all or part of any penalties arising from the violation, but may condition such remission upon a correction of the violation within a time period fixed by the court.\n      � 4. This local law takes effect immediately.\n\n\nNAW\nLS #13395/5045/13572/13801/14347/14660/15487/17317\n7/12/2024 11:17 AM\n\n      2\n      \n      \n      3",
