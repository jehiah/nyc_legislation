  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Sanitation (DSNY) to, within 24 hours of receiving a report of an abandoned vehicle, determine whether such vehicle can be classified as “derelict” under state law, meaning it is abandoned, does not have license plates, and has a wholesale value of $1250 or less. If such vehicle is derelict and the vehicle identification number is not ascertainable by DSNY, the Department would be required to remove such vehicle or cause it to be removed from the street within 72 hours of receiving the report.",
