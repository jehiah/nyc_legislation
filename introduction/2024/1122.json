  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DOITT) to develop and publish on their website a plan for the City to achieve universal, affordable, and equitable access to internet in homes throughout the City. The plan would need to be updated every 5 years, and would address how the City will build out the necessary infrastructure and work with internet service providers to facilitate the provision of low-cost internet throughout the City, prioritizing access for underserved areas. This bill would also create an internet advisory board, which would be responsible for reviewing previously published plans, and making recommendations for policy related to internet access and infrastructure needs in the city and improvements to the plan. DOITT would also be required to post online an annual report that details any progress made in implementing the plan.",
