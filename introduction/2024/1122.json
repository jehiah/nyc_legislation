  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DOITT) to develop and publish on its website an internet master plan for the City to achieve low-cost access to broadband internet in homes throughout the City. The plan would need to be updated every 5 years, and would address the City’s efforts to expand access to low-cost broadband internet prioritizing access for underserved areas.  This bill would also create an internet advisory board, which would be responsible for reviewing plans, and making recommendations related to improvements to the plan. DOITT would also be required to post online an annual report detailing any progress made in implementing the plan.",
