  "Summary": "This bill would require the department of transportation, in consultation with the department of health and mental hygiene, the department of environmental protection, and the office of long-term planning and sustainability, to conduct a pilot project on the use of cool pavement. Cool pavement is pavement or pavement coatings designed to keep temperatures cooler than traditional asphalt. The pilot will begin September 2026 and include at least one neighborhood in each borough that has high summer surface temperatures and low median income. The department of transportation must then submit a report to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council on the results of the pilot project.",
