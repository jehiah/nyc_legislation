  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation to conduct a pilot project, in consultation with the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, on the use of cool pavement—pavement and pavement coatings designed to keep area temperatures cooler than traditional asphalt and thus combat the urban heat island effect—on City streets. The pilot is required to include at least four neighborhoods that are, or include, both disadvantaged communities and heat vulnerable communities. The Department must then submit a report to the Mayor and Council on the results of the pilot project.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Cool pavement pilot project. a. Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings:\n      Cool pavement. The term \"cool pavement\" means porous, permeable, light-colored, or other pavement and pavement coatings designed to reduce pavement temperatures and ambient air temperatures.\n      Disadvantaged communities. The term \"disadvantaged communities\" has the same meaning as that term is defined in section 75-0101 of the environmental conservation law.\n      Heat vulnerability. The term \"heat vulnerability\" has the same meaning as that term is defined in section 17-199.14.\n      Heat vulnerability index. The term \"heat vulnerability index\" means a measure of heat vulnerability on a scale of 1 through 5 with 1 representing the lowest risk of heat stress deaths and heat exacerbated deaths and 5 representing the highest risk of such deaths.\n      Heat vulnerable community. The term \"heat vulnerable community\" means a neighborhood tabulation area with a heat vulnerability index of 4 or 5. \n      Hyperlocal temperature monitoring. The term \"hyperlocal temperature monitoring\" means monitoring and measuring of hourly average temperature on a block-by-block basis.\n      Neighborhood tabulation area. The term \"neighborhood tabulation area\" means a geographical area defined by the department of city planning for the purposes of providing neighborhood-level data. \n      b. The department of transportation shall, in consultation with the department of health and mental hygiene, conduct a two-year pilot project for the use of cool pavement on city streets in at least 4 neighborhood tabulation areas that are, or include, both disadvantaged communities and heat vulnerable communities. As part of such pilot project, the department shall implement the best available research methodologies to conduct hyperlocal temperature monitoring and assess the range of options for cool pavement and the technical feasibility, environmental impacts, and all anticipated costs of such options. The department shall post on its website and submit to the mayor and the speaker of the council a report on the results of the pilot project no later than 180 days after the pilot concludes.\n      � 2.
