  "Summary": "This bill would require NYC Department of Sanitation (DSNY) and the NYC Department of Education (DOE) to establish a pilot program to develop and distribute educational materials to students and staff regarding the reduction of surplus food in public schools, the benefits of food waste diversion, and the role of students and staff in diverting organic matter from landfills.  In developing such materials, DSNY would be required to consult with local education and sustainability officials.  This bill would also require DOE to distribute such educational materials to students and staff twice per year, for a two-year period.  DOE would also be required to report any challenges encountered during the pilot program’s implementation and recommendations for its future, as well as an evaluation of any methods identified to reduce the instances in which food ordered by a school becomes surplus food.",
