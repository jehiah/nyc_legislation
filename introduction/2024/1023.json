  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Correction (DOC) to establish and operate an online scheduling system to facilitate visits to incarcerated individuals, provided that DOC shall not require the use of the online scheduling system to visit an incarcerated individual. At minimum, this online scheduling system must be accessible by mobile devices and computers, give the public the ability to request dates and times for jail visits, allow DOC to notify individuals if a scheduled visit needs to be canceled, and provide individuals with a reason if their request to schedule a visit is not approved. If an individual misses their scheduled appointment, they may complete the visit at a later time on that date where practicable. Starting January 30, 2028, the bill requires annual reporting on the number of people who used the online scheduling system to schedule a visit and were approved by DOC, the number of people who used the online system and were not approved by DOC, the number of people who visited an incarcerated individual and did not use the online scheduling system, and the number of complaints the department received regarding the online scheduling system for visits.",
