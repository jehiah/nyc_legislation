  "Summary": "This bill would require persons who assemble or evaluate screening reports containing court history of residential tenants and applicants for residential housing to be licensed by the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP). The bill would also require that all tenant screening reports contain certain information about each court proceeding referenced in the report. Finally, the bill would grant DCWP enforcement authority, would establish civil penalties for violations, and would create a private right of action for tenants and prospective tenants injured by violations.",
