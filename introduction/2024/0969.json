  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Parks and Recreation (Parks) to create a list of at least 50 of the most harmful tree species based on certain factors, including the potential damage a tree species can cause to nearby property. Where a tree under the jurisdiction of Parks is adjacent to a certain property, the property owner may request that Parks remove the tree and replace it with a non-harmful tree. Parks would have nine months to remove that tree and replace it with a less harmful tree.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Chapter 1 of title 18 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 18-107.1 to read as follows:\n      � 18-107.1 Harmful tree replacement. a. Definitions. For purposes of this section, the term \"harmful tree\" means any tree that is under the exclusive jurisdiction of the commissioner, and that causes or is likely to cause: \n      1. Economic harm,\n      2. Harm to infrastructure,\n      3. Environmental or ecological harm, or\n      4. Harm to human health.\n      b. No later than 1 year after the effective date of the local law that added this section, the department shall create a list of no less than 50 of the most harmful tree species that are known to exist within the city. The criteria for inclusion on this list shall include the potential damage the tree can cause to nearby infrastructure and property, the extent to which the tree is capable of spreading in different conditions, whether the tree is a non-native species, and whether the tree is known to harbor or support any other invasive or non-native species. The department shall place on its website a geospatial reference for the presence of any known harmful tree of a species designated on such list.\n      c. Where any private property is adjacent to, as determined by rule, a harmful tree species designated on the department's list, the owner of such property may request that the department remove such harmful tree. The department shall respond within 9 months of the submission of the request and replace the harmful tree with a non-harmful tree. Where practicable, the department shall allow the owner requesting removal to choose a specific non-harmful tree to replace the harmful tree.\n      d. The department shall conduct outreach and education to property owners that may be affected by harmful tree species.\n      � 2.
