  "Summary": "This bill would require physicians and nurses employed by or contracted with the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) and working in public schools through the Office of School Health (OSH) to complete annual competency training on health concerns related to sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, and sex characteristics. This training would be required for DOHMH employees and contractors and be offered to all other medical personnel working in public schools through OSH, including Department of Education employees and contractors. Such training would focus on health concerns for the community, including information related to the prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted infections, information related to variations in sex characteristics, health concerns related to gender-affirming health care, and a list of referrals and resources to help medical personnel connect students with such care. This bill would also require reporting on attendance of such training, disaggregated by agency.",
