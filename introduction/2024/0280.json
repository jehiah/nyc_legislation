  "Summary": "This bill would require that city parks with an area of at least 2.5 acres have certain numbers of sheltered bicycle parking stations so that park-goers would have a place to store their bicycles or other personal mobility devices. For parks that are of a larger size, a greater number of stations would be required based on how large those parks are. The Commissioner of Parks and Recreation would have the discretion to determine the location of each station and whether storage of personal mobility devices other than bicycles is allowed at each station. Where it would be impractical to install a station, the Commissioner of Parks and Recreation would have to explain on the Department of Parks and Recreation’s website why it would be impractical.",
