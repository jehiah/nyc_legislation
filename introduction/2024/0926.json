  "Summary": "This bill would require that the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications, or another office or agency designated by the Mayor, promulgate rules establishing minimum appropriate and responsible use practices that all agencies must follow in developing, procuring, deploying, and using public-impacting artificial intelligence. These rules would be reviewed annually. The Department, or such other office or agency, would also be required to submit a report every two years to the Council and the Mayor on the minimum practices, their use, and any updates or changes that were made over the past two years.",
