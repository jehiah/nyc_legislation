  "Summary": "This bill would require the City Chief Procurement Officer (“CCPO”) to establish a standard insurance policy that would be mandatory for all food procurement vendors contracting with city agencies. The standard policy would need to include, at a minimum: (1) commercial general liability insurance; (2) product liability insurance, which could be satisfied by a specialized food liability policy; and (3) any other coverages the CCPO deems necessary to protect against food procurement risks. Agency food procurement contracts would need to require vendors to maintain insurance meeting the standard policy requirements. The CCPO would review the standard policy annually and make necessary changes considering the adequacy of risk coverage and consistency with food industry standards.",
