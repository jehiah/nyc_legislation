The civil penalties would be at least $5,000 and no more than $10,000 for a first violation, and for each succeeding violation, the penalty would be at least $10,000 and no more than $15,000, except that, for violations related to prohibited conduct and guaranteeing any particular governmental action on advertisements, the civil penalties would be at least $7,500 and no more than $10,000 for the first violation and, for each succeeding violation, the penalty would be at least $18,000 and no more than $20,000. The bill would also clarify that immigration assistance service providers who advertise services via images, as well as by signs, pamphlets, newspapers, and any other means, must post or include with the advertisement a legally required notice of the services they are not authorized to provide.",
