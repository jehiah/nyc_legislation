  "Summary": "This bill would replace the terms “inmate” and “prisoner,” as well as “incarcerated individual,” with person-first language (PFL) such as “persons incarcerated” and “persons in custody” throughout the City Charter, the Administrative Code, the Plumbing Code, and the Building Code. PFL is a linguistic prescription that emphasizes personhood over status-saturated identifiers. This law would seek to eliminate conscious and subconscious dehumanization associated with the terms “inmate” and “prisoner.” Notably, this is a stylistic modification that does not impact the substance of modified sections.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Declaration of legislative intent and findings. The council finds that it should be the policy of this city to promote the dignified and fair treatment of persons in the criminal justice system and in other institutions of confinement. The council declares that the use of outmoded terms, including \"inmate\" and \"prisoner,\" to refer to persons incarcerated or persons in custody in the criminal justice system and other institutions, is dehumanizing and demeaning to such persons, and that such terms should be eliminated from use in local law and replaced with terms that emphasize persons first, and not their circumstances. Through the elimination and replacement of such terminology, the council does not intend to alter the substantive meaning of the affected provisions of law.\n      � 2. Subdivision e of section 13-c of the New York city charter, as amended by chapter 322 of the laws of 2021, is amended to read as follows: \n      e. Four-year plan. Within one year after the completion of the first biennial report required by subdivision d of this section, and in every fourth calendar year thereafter, the coordinator shall prepare and submit to the mayor and the council a four-year plan for providing reentry services to those city residents who need such services. Such plan may include recommendations for approaches to serving city residents in need of reentry services, including the establishment of an initial point of access for individuals immediately upon their release from the custody of the department of correction in a location adjacent to Rikers Island or to the correctional facility that releases the most [incarcerated individuals] persons incarcerated daily. Such report and plan shall also identify obstacles to making such services available to all those who need them and describe what additional resources would be necessary to do so. \n      � 3. Paragraph (8) of subdivision d of section 556 of the New York city charter, as amended by chapter 322 of the laws of 2021, is amended to read as follows:\n      (8) promote or provide medical and health services for [the incarcerated individuals of] persons incarcerated in prisons maintained and operated by the city;\n      � 4.

All authority in relation to the custody and transportation of persons held for any cause in criminal proceedings and all [prisoners] persons under arrest awaiting arraignment who require hospital care, including those requiring psychiatric observation or treatment, in any county within the city.\n      � 5.

Section 625 of the New York city charter, as amended by chapter 322 of the laws of 2021, is amended to read as follows:\n      � 625. Labor of [prisoners] persons incarcerated. Every [incarcerated individual of] person incarcerated by an institution under the authority of the commissioner shall be employed in some form of industry, in farming operations or other employment, and products thereof shall be utilized in the institutions under the commissioner or in any other agency. Those persons held for trial may be employed in the same manner as persons who have been sentenced [prisoners], provided they give their consent in writing. Such [incarcerated individuals or prisoners] persons held for trial may be detailed by the commissioner to perform work or service on the grounds and buildings or on any public improvement under the charge of any other agency.\n      � 7.

Such report shall incorporate direct feedback from [incarcerated individuals] persons incarcerated and proposed recommendations for relevant improvements, and shall include a section of recommendations on how to improve the grievance process for vulnerable populations, including [incarcerated individuals] persons incarcerated who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, and gender nonconforming. Such report shall be submitted to the council and posted on the board's website.\n      � 8. Paragraph 8 of subdivision b of section 1054 of the New York city charter, as added by local law number 6 for the year 2019, is amended to read as follows:\n      8. conduct yearly trainings for all relevant staff of the department of correction.

Such department shall, not later than five days after receipt, transmit such completed applications and ballots from any [incarcerated individual] person incarcerated who wishes to have them transmitted to the board of elections for the city of New York. The provisions of this subdivision shall not apply in any specific instance in which the department deems it unsafe to comply therewith.\n      [10] 11. The department of correction shall, in addition to the other requirements of this section for participating agencies, distribute to every person upon release from custody of the department a written notice on the voting rights of [formerly incarcerated persons] persons formerly incarcerated in the state of New York, including information on when such persons are or may become eligible to vote, and offer to every such person a voter registration form. The department shall make verbal reference to the distributed written notice and voter registration form to such individuals upon distribution. Such notice shall only be required for those who are released from a department facility, from department custody within a courthouse, and from a department-operated area within a hospital or healthcare provider. Notice is not required for those who are released to the custody of another government agency or to the custody of a hospital or healthcare provider. Such written notice shall be developed in consultation with the voter assistance advisory committee.\n      � 10. Subdivision 3 of section 5-509 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\n      3.

The city may in any year, and from time to time, increase or diminish, the sum authorized to be paid to any such institution, association, corporation or society. The final estimate shall specify each institution by its corporate name and the sum to be paid thereto, with a reference to the laws authorizing the appropriation, and the comptroller is authorized to pay the sum to such institution upon its appearing to his or her satisfaction in such manner as he or she shall prescribe that the expenditure thereof by the institution is lawful and proper. Appropriations shall be made under this section to any corporation only if the mayor, or the president of the borough in which the chief office of such corporation is situated, is notified of all meetings of its board of management, and is empowered to attend the same or designate in writing some person to do so in his or her behalf; but this shall not be construed as impairing any existing powers of visitation vested in the supreme court or the state board of social welfare, or any provisions of law requiring statements by such corporations as to their affairs.\n      � 11. Section 7-516 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\n      � 7-516 Construction clause.

In any action under this subdivision, evidence of the common fame and general reputation of the building, erection or place, including one- or two-family dwellings, of the [inmates or] occupants thereof, or of those resorting thereto, shall be competent evidence to prove the existence of the public nuisance. If evidence of the general reputation of the building, erection or place, including one- or two-family dwellings, or of the [inmates or] occupants thereof, is sufficient to establish the existence of the public nuisance, it shall be prima facie evidence of knowledge thereof and acquiescence and participation therein and responsibility for the nuisance, on the part of the owners, lessors, lessees and all those in possession of or having charge of, as agent or otherwise, or having any interest in any form in the property, real or personal, used in conducting or maintaining the public nuisance;\n      � 13.
