  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Small Business Services (SBS) to create an online job bank for individuals with federal employment authorization. The website hosting the job bank would include a portal that would permit employers to submit job postings. Each job posting included on the website would indicate whether the position requires candidates to possess U.S. citizenship, Lawful Permanent Resident status, or an Employment Authorization Document. The Mayorâ€™s Office of Immigrant Affairs would coordinate with SBS, all other relevant city agencies, and community and labor organizations deemed appropriate by SBS to conduct outreach regarding the job bank to immigrants in New York City.",
