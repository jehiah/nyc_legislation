  "Summary": "This bill would require the Commissioner of Environmental Protection to identify the areas of the city that commonly experience helicopter noise and install sound level meters in those areas on top of city buildings, streetlights and, upon request of the owner, private buildings. The Commissioner of Environmental Protection would also be required to reassess the identified areas every 2 years. The data collected by the sound level meters would be reported on the Department of Environmental Protection’s website monthly.",
