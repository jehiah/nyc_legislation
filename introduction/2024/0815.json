  "Summary": "This bill would require the Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability to create an inland flood hazard area map to determine which areas outside of the federally designated coastal flood areas are most vulnerable to extreme rainfall and stormwater flooding. This bill would also amend Appendix G of the Building Code to require that new or substantially altered buildings in the inland flood hazard area be built to the standards that apply to some federal special flood hazard areas.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Subdivision b of section 24-808 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 122 for the year 2021, is amended to read as follows:\n      b. Not later than September 30, 2022, and every 10 years thereafter, the office, or another agency or office designated by the director, in consultation with the department of city planning, the department of environmental protection, the department of transportation, the department of housing preservation and development, the department of education, the department of citywide administrative services, the department of buildings, and the department of parks and recreation, shall develop and post on the office's website a climate adaptation plan that considers and evaluates a range of climate hazards impacting the city, including its shoreline, and identifies and recommends resiliency and adaptation measures, including potential updates to the zoning resolution and the construction codes, and non-structural risk reduction approaches to protect and prepare the city's residents, property and infrastructure.\n      � 2. Chapter 8 of title 24 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 24-808.1 to read as follows:\n      � 24-808.1 Inland flood hazard area map. a. Definitions. As used in this section, the term \"inland flood hazard area\" means the area outside the special flood hazard area and shaded X-Zone that would flood with 1.75 inches or greater of rainfall intensity per hour to a height of 4 inches or greater.\n      b. Inland flood hazard area map. 1. No later than 1 year after the effective date of the local law that added this section, the office, in consultation with the department of buildings and the department of environmental protection, shall create and post on the office's website a map of the inland flood hazard area. Such map shall assume uniformity of rainfall across the city and that the existing drainage system is functioning as intended. Such map shall also indicate a base flood elevation level showing the elevation of surface water within the inland flood area resulting from a flood over a uniform duration of time. \n      2. In creating this map, the office shall consider the following factors:\n      (a) The appropriate geographic unit to represent flooding risk at the minimum amount of contiguous area to be considered in determining which areas should be covered by the map;\n      (b) All relevant hydrologic and topographic data necessary to complete the map;\n      (c) Whether the office believes that future updates to the special flood hazard area might overlap with any inland flood hazard area indicated on the map; and\n      (d) Any relevant information on all buildings in the inland flood hazard area, including building age and occupancy type.\n      3. The office shall review the inland flood hazard area map no less than every 5 years thereafter and update the map as appropriate.\n      4. In creating or updating the map, the office shall provide for a public comment process and provide guidance to the public on the types of technical, topographic, hydrologic or other factual information that would be most useful for consideration.\n      \n      � 3. The definition of \"COASTAL ZONES AND WATER-SENSITIVE INLAND ZONES\" set forth in section 28-104.9.1 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 126 for the year 2021, is amended to read as follows:\nCOASTAL ZONES AND WATER-SENSITIVE INLAND ZONES.
