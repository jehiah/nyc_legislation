  "Summary": "This bill would amend the Administrative Code by establishing a Commission on Shelter Siting composed of 15 members as follows: 5 members appointed by the City Council Speaker, 5 appointed by the Mayor, and 5 appointed by the Borough Presidents. The commission would analyze the locations of shelters across the city and develop a plan prescribing the future placement of shelters with the goal of enhancing their proximity to public transit and essential services for their residents. The commission would meet at least three times per year and produce annually a report of its activities for the Mayor and Council that includes its homeless shelter siting plan. The bill would require the commission to solicit input from community boards and the public with respect to the development of the plan. Once developed, the Department of Homeless Services would be required to implement the plan.",
