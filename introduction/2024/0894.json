  "Summary": "This bill would authorize the Commissioner of Finance to establish a 90 day, temporary program to resolve outstanding penalties imposed by the Environmental Control Board and Parking Violations Bureau. With certain conditions, the program would permit those who are subject to default judgments to resolve them by paying the base penalty and having the default penalty and accrued interest waived. It would also permit, with certain conditions, those who are subject to judgments as a result of a finding by the ECB that they were in violation to resolve those judgments by paying 75 percent of the imposed penalty and having the accrued interest waived. The program would last for 90 days in fiscal year 2025 and the Commissioner would be able to extend the program for an additional 90 days. Respondents who made certain partial penalty payments prior to the start of the program would be eligible to resolve the associated judgments.",
