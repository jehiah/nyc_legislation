  "Summary": "This bill would permit pedestrians to legally cross a roadway at any point, including outside of a marked or unmarked crosswalk, and allow for crossing against traffic signals. It would legalize the activity commonly referred to as “jaywalking” and specify that crossing against a traffic signal or crossing at any point outside of a crosswalk will not be a violation of the administrative code and therefore can no longer be the subject of a summons.  The bill would also require the Department of Transportation to conduct an education effort regarding the rights and responsibilities of pedestrians and of operators of motor vehicles, bicycles, and other mobility devices on city roadways.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Section 19-195 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 115 for the year 2016, is amended to read as follows: \n      � 19-195 Pedestrian crossings and control signals. a. Whenever pedestrian control signals are in operation, exhibiting symbols of a walking person, upraised hand, or upraised hand with a pedestrian countdown display, or any other internationally recognized representation concerning the movement of pedestrians, such signals shall indicate as follows:\n      1. Steady walking person. Pedestrians facing such signal may proceed across the roadway in the direction of such signal, and other traffic shall yield the right of way to such pedestrians. \n      2. Flashing upraised hand or flashing upraised hand with pedestrian countdown display. Pedestrians facing such signal are advised that there may be insufficient time to cross the roadway. Pedestrians already in the roadway [shall] are cautioned to proceed to the nearest sidewalk or safety island in the direction of such signal. Other traffic shall yield the right of way to pedestrians proceeding across the roadway within the crosswalk towards such signal for as long as such signal remains flashing.\n      3. Steady upraised hand. [No pedestrians shall start to cross the roadway in the direction of such signal; provided, however that any pedestrians who have partially completed their crossing on a steady walking person signal or any flashing upraised hand signal shall proceed to the nearest sidewalk or safety island in the direction of such signal while such steady upraised hand signal is showing.] Pedestrians crossing in the direction of such signal do not have the right of way. Pedestrians entering the roadway in the direction of such signal will be at risk of injury due to other traffic that has the right of way. Pedestrians may proceed across the roadway in the direction of a steady upraised hand but shall yield to other traffic that has the right of way, provided that a failure to yield shall not be a violation of this section.\n      b. Pedestrians crossing at points outside of a marked or unmarked crosswalk do not have the right of way. Pedestrians may cross any roadway, other than a limited access highway, at any point, including points outside of a marked or unmarked crosswalk, but shall yield to other traffic that has the right of way, provided that a failure to yield shall not be a violation of this section.\n      c. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, a pedestrian must exercise all duty of care when entering a roadway at a crosswalk facing a pedestrian signal with a steady upraised hand or at a point other than a marked or unmarked crosswalk. Nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve any person from the duty of due care for their safety or the safety of others in a roadway. \n\t� 2. Subchapter 3 of chapter 1 of title 19 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 19-195.2 to read as follows: \n\t� 19-195.2 Public education campaign. The department shall conduct a continuing public education effort regarding the rights and responsibilities of pedestrians and operators of motor vehicles, bicycles, and other mobility devices on city roadways. \n      � 3.
