  "Summary": "This bill would require that by June 30, 2025, and regularly thereafter, the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) submit to the Mayor and Speaker of the Council, and post on the DEP website, a plan to prevent confirmed sewer backups and which identifies areas that regularly flood after rainfall events. This bill would also require that DEP incorporate into the assessments of its sustainable stormwater management plan a timeline for installing larger storm sewer mains and grey-water reuse systems in areas that regularly flood after rainfall events and identification of at least 5 areas per borough that regularly flood after rainfall events with a plan to address such flooding. It would also require that DEP conduct community outreach about stormwater management practices.",
