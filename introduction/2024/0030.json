  "Summary": "This bill would establish safety requirements for powered bicycles when used by contracted delivery workers who deliver for delivery services. Specifically, the bill requires that any powered bicycle operated by a contracted delivery worker on behalf of a delivery service meet local standards established for the sale of such device, which includes certification by an accredited testing laboratory. Such device may be provided by the delivery service or the worker, but the delivery service could not require that the worker obtain a compliant device as a term of employment. Responsibility for compliance with these provisions would fall on the delivery service. This bill would relieve a delivery service of their obligation to verify the use of compliant powered bicycles under this law if the delivery service contributes significantly to a trade-in program that provides compliant e-bikes to delivery workers that trade in their non-compliant devices. It would also relieve a delivery service of their obligation under the law if the delivery service contributes to a rental program that would rent compliant devices and batteries to delivery workers.",
