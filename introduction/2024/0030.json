  "Summary": "This bill would establish safety standards for powered bicycles and powered mobility devices when used for food delivery services, grocery delivery services and businesses using bicycles for commercial purposes. Specifically, the bill requires that any powered mobility device operated by a delivery worker on behalf of a third-party delivery service, third-party courier service, third-party grocery service or business using a bicycle for commercial purposes meet local standards established for the sale of such device, which includes certification by an accredited testing laboratory. Where such a device was being used, third-party delivery services, third-party courier services, and businesses using bicycles for commercial purposes would be responsible for providing the worker with the device at no expense to the worker, or could allow the worker to provide their own compliant device. They could not require the worker to provide a powered bicycle or mobility device at the worker’s expense, however. Finally, responsibility for compliance with these provisions would fall on the third-party delivery service, third-party courier service, or the businesses which would be subject to civil penalties for any violations.",
