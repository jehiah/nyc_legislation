  "Summary": "This bill would require that certain city-owned buildings at least 10,000 square feet or more in size provide bicycle storage space for city employees or visitors. The Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) would have the discretion to determine the location of the storage and whether it is appropriate to separate employee storage from non-employee bicycle storage. For school buildings, the Chancellor of the Department of Education would have the discretion to determine whether they believe there is appropriate space for bicycle storage. Where it would be impractical to have any storage, DCAS would have to explain in a posting in a common area why bicycle storage would be impractical. Finally, the DCAS commissioner and the DOE chancellor must report publicly where each building has added bicycle storage, and where it was determined that adding bicycle storage was impractical.",
