Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the department of finance and the department of housing preservation and development shall not initiate any foreclosure action against a class one or class two real property parcel pursuant to this chapter for a period of two years from the effective date of the local law that added this section. Where such an action has already been initiated against a class one or class two real property parcel prior to the effective date of the local law that added this section, the commissioner of finance shall withdraw the parcel from the proceeding pursuant to section 11-413.\n      b. During the two-year period described in subdivision a of this section, the department of housing preservation and development shall report on a quarterly basis the street address of each class one and class two property that such department determines would be eligible for acquisition pursuant to this chapter but for the moratorium on such actions set forth in subdivision a of this section, disaggregated by council district and community district. Such reports shall include the current status of the properties in question, including but not limited to whether the property has had foreclosure actions initiated against it and whether a foreclosure judgment has been entered against the property.
