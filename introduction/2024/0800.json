  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR) to develop criteria by which they prioritize tree maintenance, taking into account the likelihood of potential harm nearby or adjacent structures, whether a tree or limb that has already fallen is still capable of causing harm, and the proximity of a damaged tree or limb to nearby buildings. DPR would also be required to post a description of the criteria used to prioritize tree maintenance on its website.",
