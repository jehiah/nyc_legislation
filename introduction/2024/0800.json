  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Parks and Recreation (Parks) to develop criteria by which they prioritize tree maintenance, taking into account the likelihood of potential harm to persons or property, whether a tree or limb that has already fallen is still capable of causing harm, and the proximity of a damaged tree or limb to nearby buildings. Parks must also post a description of the criteria used to prioritize tree maintenance on its website.",
