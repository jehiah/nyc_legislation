  "Summary": "This bill would require the Office of Data Analytics (MODA), in coordination with the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) and the New York City Commission on Human Rights (CCHR), to conduct an annual pay and employment equity study on private employers with 150 or more employees. The study would focus on the identification of pay and employment disparities among employees of such employers based on protected classes in employment under the City’s Human Rights Law. MODA, in coordination with the above mentioned agencies, would also be required to submit to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council and post online annually a report on the findings of the study, including in part an analysis of the data collected pursuant to the study and recommendations on the development and implementation of pay and employment equity action plans. DCWP and CCHR would need to publicize the recommendations annually to private employers.",
