The study would use the pay data information submitted by employers to evaluate whether there are disparities in compensation based on gender and race or ethnicity. The agency would be required to submit to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council a report on the findings of the study. The agency would also publish the information contained in the pay reports submitted by covered employers.",
