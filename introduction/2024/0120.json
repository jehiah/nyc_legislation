  "Summary": "This bill would enhance the pre-arraignment health screening units at central booking facilities. It would obligate a health care provider—defined to include nurse practitioners and patient care associates and exclude emergency personnel—to use an electronic screening tool and access two electronic health databases—e-Clinical Works and Psychiatric Services and Clinical Knowledge Enhancement System—to conduct a two-level screening of each arrestee for physical and behavioral health issues. A diversion liaison would identify the arrestees with behavioral health needs and share health information, with the arrestee’s consent, with defense counsel to facilitate pre- and post-arraignment diversion. The arrestee’s health information would also be shared with the Department of Correction (DOC), if the arrestee is taken into DOC custody. This bill would also require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to establish rules to ensure the arrestee’s health information is shared with DOC, if the arrestee is taken into DOC custody.",
