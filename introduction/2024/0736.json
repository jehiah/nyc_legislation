  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), in consultation with the Department of Sanitation (DSNY) and an expert in rodent control, to establish a pilot program to deploy rat contraceptives within 180 days of the bill’s enactment, for a period of at least 12 months. DOHMH would be required to establish two pilot program areas and at least one comparison area with similar building types. The pilot program areas would be required to be located within rat mitigation zones, with majority residential buildings and where a majority of buildings are required to set out waste in containers. During the pilot program, DOHMH would be required to perform monthly inspections of such areas to track signs of rats. After the pilot period, DOHMH would be required to report to the Mayor and Speaker of the Council findings and other information collected during the pilot program.",

The term \"rat mitigation zone\" means a zone designated pursuant to section 17-133.2 of the administrative code of the city of New York.\n      Rat signs. The term \"rat signs\" means the observable and measurable indicators, established in consultation with at least 1 expert in rodent control, used by the department of health and mental hygiene to determine the presence of rats, including but not limited to burrows, rub marks, runways, tracks, gnaw marks, droppings, and the presence of live rats.\n      b. Pilot program. The department, in consultation with the department of sanitation and at least 1 expert in rodent control, shall establish a pilot program to deploy rat contraceptives and, as appropriate, any other technology recommended by at least 1 expert in rodent control to reduce the rat population. Such program shall involve the following:\n      1. The pilot program shall be installed in areas to be designated by the department, provided that each area: (i) include buildings a majority of which are residential; (ii) include buildings a majority of which are required to set out waste in receptacles pursuant to rules promulgated by the department of sanitation; and (iii) be located within a rat mitigation zone. There shall be at least 2 pilot program areas, each of which shall cover at least 10 city blocks in surface area;\n      2. The department shall designate at least 1 pilot program comparison area that includes building types similar to those included in the pilot program areas, and shall make reasonable efforts to implement similar mitigation efforts, other than the deployment of rat contraceptive, across the pilot program areas and the pilot program comparison area or areas to allow for a controlled comparison;\n      3. The department shall deploy rat contraceptive at locations in the pilot program areas determined in consultation with the department of sanitation; and\n      4. For no less than 12 months immediately after the deployment of the rat contraceptive, the department shall perform monthly inspections of each pilot program area and each pilot program comparison area and shall tally all rat signs observed in each area, disaggregated by type of rat sign. During such monthly inspections of the pilot program areas, the department shall track the amount of rat contraceptive in each rat contraceptive dispenser. Any data provided by a vendor that supplies the department with rat contraceptive or other technology for the pilot program pursuant to this section shall be verified by an independent entity. \n      c. Implementation. The pilot program established pursuant to subdivision b of this section shall commence no later than 180 days after the effective date of this local law. The duration of the pilot program established pursuant to subdivision b of this section shall be no less than 12 months. Prior to the end of the pilot program, the department shall develop a plan for the safe removal of rat contraceptive from the pilot program areas to minimize, to the extent practicable, any increase in the rat population and any impact on residents living in such areas.\n      d. Report. No later than 180 days after the end of the pilot program established pursuant to this section, the commissioner of health and mental hygiene, in consultation with the commissioner of sanitation and at least 1 expert in rodent control, shall prepare and submit to the mayor and the speaker of the council a report regarding the outcomes of such pilot program and inspections during the period of such program.
