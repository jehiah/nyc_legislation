  "Summary": "This bill would create a permanent, long-term strategic planning process for establishing and maintaining a citywide public bathroom network. This would be led by a Deputy Mayor in collaboration with the Department of City Planning, the Department of Parks and Recreation, the Department of Transportation, and any other agency with relevant experience and expertise. The relevant agency would be required to produce a strategic planning report, to be updated every 4 years, with the goal of providing at least 2,120 public bathrooms by 2035, at least half of which would be publicly owned. The strategic plan would propose a capital strategy, recommend law or policy changes to support bathroom openings or conversions, and identify sites that could be converted to public bathroom use. The report would recommend a design model for a modular bathroom facility as compliant with city requirements. The agency would also post a comprehensive online map of all public bathrooms in the City.",
