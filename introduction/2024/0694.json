  "Summary": "This bill would create a permanent, long-term strategic planning process, led by the Chief Public Realm Officer (CPRO), the Department of City Planning (DCP), and the Mayor’s Office of Operations (MOO), for the establishment and maintenance of a citywide public bathroom network. The CPRO, DCP, and MOO would be required to work with relevant city agencies to produce a strategic planning report, to be updated every 4 years, with the goal of providing 1 toilet per 2000 residents by 2035 and thereafter. The strategic plan would propose a capital strategy, recommend law or policy changes to support bathroom openings or conversions, and identify various types of sites that could be converted to public bathroom use. The bill would also require the departments to designate at least one design model for a modular bathroom facility as compliant with applicable city requirements and to publish a comprehensive map of all public bathrooms in the city.",
