  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DOITT) to provide information on its 311 customer center website on identifying whether an overhead wire is electrical or non-electrical. This bill would also require the 311 customer service center to add a 311 complaint category for non-electrical overhead wires. When it receives a non-electric overhead wire complaint, DOITT would be required to identify the cable company responsible for the repair and maintenance of the non-electric wire. The complaint would be considered closed once DOITT provides the name of the cable provider to the 311 customer. Lastly, this bill would also make a technical correction to section 23-304 of the administrative code.",
