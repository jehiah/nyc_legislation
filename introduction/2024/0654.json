Compliance with applicable law. Rehabilitation program benefits shall not be allowed for any eligible building unless and until such eligible building complies with all applicable provisions of law. Rehabilitation program benefits shall not be allowed if the department of housing preservation and development determines that eligible construction was not carried out in conformity with all applicable provisions of law.\n            f. Bedroom count. If eligible construction results in a change in the number of dwelling units in an eligible building, then, upon the completion date, the number of bedrooms in such eligible building shall be equal to no less than 75 percent of the total number of dwelling units, provided, however, that if the average dwelling unit floor area in such eligible building is 1,000 square feet or more, the requirement that the number of bedrooms be equal to no less than 75 percent of the total number of dwelling units shall not be applicable and, provided further, that such requirement shall be reduced to the extent the application of such requirement would necessitate a reduction in the number of dwelling units which are contained in such eligible building prior to the commencement date.\n            g. Tenant notification. Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, no rehabilitation program benefits shall be granted for any eligible construction with a commencement date on or after the effective date of this local law unless the applicant provides to tenants, if any, of such eligible building prior to the commencement date, notice of the following information: (1) the proposed work, (2) the identity and contact information of the eligible building's representative, and (3) the tenants' rights under applicable law with respect to such work; provided that, in the case of a loan program supervised by the department of housing preservation and development, the department may provide the required notice to the tenants.\n            h. Notice of intent. An applicant for rehabilitation program benefits for any eligible construction with a commencement date on or after the effective date of this local law shall file with the department of housing preservation and development a form supplied by such department which (1) states an intention to file for rehabilitation program benefits, (2) describes the work for which rehabilitation program benefits will be claimed, (3) estimates the cost of such work which will be eligible for rehabilitation program benefits, and (4) provides proof of the notice required under subdivision g of this section. Such form shall be filed prior to the commencement date. If the scope of such work or the estimated cost thereof changes materially, such applicant shall file a revised notice of intent. An applicant who fails to comply with the requirements of this subdivision shall be subject to a penalty not to exceed 100 percent of the filing fee otherwise payable pursuant to paragraph 3 of subdivision c of this section. \n            i. Re-inspection penalty. If any eligible construction claimed on an application for a certificate of eligibility and reasonable cost cannot be verified upon the first inspection  by the department of housing preservation and development, such applicant shall be required to pay 10 times the actual cost of any additional inspection needed to verify such eligible construction.\n            j. Strict liability for inaccurate applications. If the department of housing preservation and development determines that an application for a certificate of eligibility and reasonable cost contains a false statement or omission as to any material matter, such application shall be rejected and no other applications pursuant to this section with respect to such eligible building shall be allowed for a period of 3 years following such determination. An applicant shall not be relieved from liability under this subdivision because it submitted its application under a mistaken belief of fact. Furthermore, any person or entity that files more than 6 applications containing such a false statement or omission within any 12 month period shall be barred from submitting any new application for a certificate of eligibility and reasonable cost on behalf of any eligible building for a period of 5 years.\n            k. False statements. Any person who shall knowingly and willfully make any false statement or omission as to any material matter in any application for a certificate of eligibility and reasonable cost shall be guilty of an offense punishable by a fine of not more than $500 or imprisonment for not more than 90 days, or both.\n            l. Implementation of rehabilitation program benefits. Upon issuance of a certificate of eligibility and reasonable cost and payment of outstanding fees, the department of housing preservation and development may transmit such certificate of eligibility and reasonable cost to the department of finance. Upon receipt of a certificate of eligibility and reasonable cost, the department of finance shall certify the amount of taxes to be abated pursuant to subdivision b of this section and pursuant to such certificate of eligibility and reasonable cost provided by the department of housing preservation and development.\n            m. Outstanding taxes and charges. Rehabilitation program benefits shall not be allowed for an eligible building in either of the following cases:\n            (1) there are outstanding real estate taxes or water and sewer charges or payments in lieu of taxes that are due and owing as of the last day of the tax period preceding the date of the receipt of the certificate of eligibility and reasonable cost by the department of finance; or\n            (2) real estate taxes or water and sewer charges due at any time during the authorized term of such benefits remain unpaid for 1 year after the same are due and payable.\n            n. Investigatory authority. The department of housing preservation and development may require such certifications and consents necessary to access records, including other tax records, as may be deemed appropriate to enforce the eligibility requirements of this section. For purposes of determining and certifying eligibility for rehabilitation program benefits and the reasonable cost of any eligible construction, the department of housing preservation and development shall be authorized to:\n            (1) administer oaths to and take the testimony of any person, including, but not limited to, the owner of such eligible building;\n            (2) issue subpoenas requiring the attendance of such persons and the production of any bills, books, papers or other documents as it may deem necessary;\n            (3) make preliminary estimates of the maximum reasonable cost of such eligible construction;\n            (4) establish maximum allowable costs of specified units, fixtures or work in such eligible construction;\n            (5) require the submission of plans and specifications of such eligible construction before the commencement thereof;\n            (6) require physical access to inspect the eligible building; and \n            (7) on an annual basis, require the submission of leases for any dwelling unit in an eligible rental building granted a certificate of eligibility and reasonable cost.\n            o. No owner of an eligible building to which rehabilitation program benefits shall be applied, nor any agent, employee, manager or officer of such owner shall directly or indirectly deny to any person because of race, color, creed, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, disability, marital status, age, religion, alienage or citizenship status, or the use of, participation in, or being eligible for a governmentally funded housing assistance program, including, but not limited to, the section 8 housing voucher program and the section 8 housing certificate program, 42 U.S.C. � 1437 et. seq., or the senior citizen or persons with disabilities rent increase exemption program, pursuant to either chapter 7 of title 26 of this code or section 26-509 of such code, any of the dwelling accommodations in such property or any of the privileges or services incident to occupancy therein. The term \"disability\" as used in this subdivision shall have the meaning set forth in section 8-102 of the code. Nothing in this subdivision shall restrict such consideration in the development of housing accommodations for the purpose of providing for the special needs of a particular group.\n            p. Termination or revocation. Failure to comply with the provisions of this section, any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any mutual company regulatory agreement or mutual redevelopment company regulatory agreement entered into thereunder may result in revocation of any rehabilitation program benefits retroactive to the commencement thereof. Such termination or revocation shall not exempt such eligible building from continued compliance with the requirements of this section, such rules and regulations, and such mutual company regulatory agreement or such mutual redevelopment company regulatory agreement.\n            q. Criminal liability for unauthorized uses. In the event that any recipient of rehabilitation program benefits uses any dwelling unit in an eligible building in violation of the requirements of this section and any rules and regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, such recipient shall be guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor punishable by a fine in an amount equivalent to double the value of the gain of such recipient from such unlawful use or imprisonment for not more than 90 days, or both.\n            r. Private right of action. Any prospective, present, or former tenant of an eligible rental building may sue to enforce the requirements and prohibitions of this section, or any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, in the supreme court of New York. Any such individual harmed by reason of a violation of such requirements and prohibitions may sue therefor in the supreme court of New York on behalf of himself or herself, and shall recover threefold the damages sustained and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee. The department of housing preservation and development may use any court decision under this subdivision that is adverse to the owner of an eligible building as the basis for further enforcement action. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an action by a tenant of an eligible rental building under this subdivision must be commenced within 6 years from the date of the latest violation.\n            s. Appointment of receiver. In addition to the remedies for non-compliance provided for in paragraph 7 of subdivision d and subdivision p of this section, the department of housing preservation and development may make application for the appointment of a receiver in accordance with the procedures contained in this subdivision. Any receiver appointed pursuant to this subdivision shall be authorized, in addition to any other powers conferred by law, to effect compliance with the provisions of this section and any rules and regulations of the department of housing preservation and development promulgated thereunder. Any expenditures incurred by the receiver to effect such compliance shall constitute a debt of the owner and a lien upon the eligible building, and upon the rents and income thereof, in accordance with the procedures contained in this subdivision. The department of housing preservation and development in its discretion may provide funds to be expended by the receiver, and such funds shall constitute a debt recoverable from the owner in accordance with applicable local laws.\n            (1) Power to order corrections of violations. Whenever the department of housing preservation and development determines that any violation of the provisions of this section, any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any mutual company regulatory agreement or mutual redevelopment company regulatory agreement entered into thereunder, has occurred, it may order the owner of the eligible building or other responsible party to correct such violation. An order issued pursuant to this paragraph shall state the violations involved and the corrective action to be taken, and shall specify a time for compliance, which shall be not less than 21 days from the date of service of the order, except that where a condition dangerous to human life and safety or detrimental to health exists or is threatened, a shorter period for compliance may be specified. \n            (2) Grounds for appointment of receiver. Upon failure of an eligible building to comply with an order to correct issued pursuant to paragraph 1 of this subdivision within the specified time for compliance, the department of housing preservation and development may apply for the appointment of a receiver to correct the violations.\n            (3) Notice to owner, mortgagees and lienors.\n            (a) If the department of housing preservation and development intends to seek the appointment of a receiver pursuant to this subdivision, it shall serve upon the owner, along with the order authorized pursuant to paragraph 1 of this subdivision, a notice stating that in the event the violations covered by the order are not corrected in the manner and within the time specified therein, such department may apply for the appointment of a receiver of the rents, issues and profits of the property with rights superior to those of the owner and any mortgagee or lienor.\n            (b) Within 5 days after service of the order and notice upon the owner, the department of housing preservation and development shall serve a copy of the order and notice upon every mortgagee and lienor of record, personally or by registered or certified mail, at the address set forth in the recorded mortgage or lien. If no address appears therein, a copy shall be sent by registered mail to the person at whose request the instrument was recorded.\n            (c) The department of housing preservation and development shall file a copy of the notice and order in the office of the county clerk in which mechanics liens affecting the eligible building would be filed.\n            (4) Order to show cause.\n            (a) The department of housing preservation and development, upon failure of the owner to comply with an order issued pursuant to paragraph 1 of this subdivision within the time provided therein, may thereafter apply to a court of competent jurisdiction in the county where the eligible building is situated for an order directing the owner and any mortgagees or lienors of record to show cause why the commissioner of housing preservation and development should not be appointed receiver of the rents, issues and profits of the eligible building and why the receiver should not correct such violation and obtain a lien in favor of the department of housing preservation and development against the eligible building having the priority provided in article 8 of subchapter 5 of chapter 2 of title 27 of the administrative code to secure repayment of the costs incurred by the receiver in removing such conditions. Such application shall contain (i) proof by affidavit that an order of the department has been issued, served on the owner, mortgagees and lienors, and filed, in accordance with subparagraph (c) of paragraph 3 of this subdivision; (ii) a statement that a violation continued to exist in such eligible building after the time fixed in the order for correction of the condition, and a description of the eligible building and violations involved; and (iii) a brief description of the nature of the actions required to correct the violations and an estimate as to the cost thereof.\n            (b) The order to show cause shall be returnable not less than 5 days after service is completed.\n            (c) A copy of the order to show cause, and the papers on which it is based, shall be served on the owner, mortgagees of record, and lienors. If any such persons cannot with due diligence be served personally within the city of New York within the time fixed in the order, then service may be made by posting a copy of the order in a conspicuous place on the eligible building, and by sending a copy thereof by registered mail to the owner at the last address, if any, registered by such owner with the department of housing preservation and development, or to his or her last address, if any, known to the department of housing preservation and development, or, in the case of a mortgagee or lienor, to the address set forth in the recorded mortgage or lien, and by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where such eligible building is located. Service shall be deemed complete on filing proof thereof in the office of the clerk of the court in which application for such order is made.\n            (5) Proceedings on return of order to show cause.\n            (a) On the return of the order to show cause, determination thereof shall have precedence over every other business of the court unless the court shall find that some other pending proceeding, having a similar statutory preference, has priority.\n            (b) If the court finds that the facts stated in the application warrant the granting thereof, then it shall appoint the commissioner of housing preservation and development receiver of the rents, issues and profits of the eligible building.\n            (c) Notwithstanding subparagraph (b) of this paragraph, if, after determination of the issue, the owner, or any mortgagee or lienor or other person having an interest in the eligible building, shall apply to the court to be permitted to correct the violations set forth in the department of housing preservation and development's application and shall (i) demonstrate the ability to promptly undertake the actions required; and (ii) post security for the performance thereof within the time, and in the amount and manner, deemed necessary by the court, then the court may in lieu of appointing a receiver issue an order permitting such person to perform the actions within a time fixed by the court. If at the time fixed in the order the actions have not been satisfactorily done, the court shall appoint such receiver. If after the granting of an order permitting a person to perform the actions but before the time fixed by the court for the completion thereof it shall appear to the department of housing preservation and development that the person permitted to do the same is not proceeding with due diligence, then such department may apply to the court, on notice to those persons who have appeared in the proceeding, for a hearing to determine whether a receiver shall be appointed immediately. On the failure of any person to complete the corrective actions in accordance with the provisions of an order under this subparagraph, such department, or any receiver thereafter appointed shall be reimbursed for costs incurred by him or her in correcting the violation and other charges herein provided for out of the security posted by such person.\n            (6) Powers and duties of receiver.\n            (a) A receiver appointed pursuant to this subdivision shall have all of the powers and duties of a receiver appointed in an action to foreclose a mortgage on real property, together with such additional powers and duties as herein granted and imposed. Such receiver shall not be required to file any bond.\n            (b) The receiver shall with all reasonable speed remove violations in the eligible building. Such receiver shall have the power to let contracts or incur expenses therefor in accordance with the provisions of law applicable to contracts for public works except that advertisement shall not be required for each such contract. Notwithstanding any provision of law, the receiver may let contracts or incur expenses for individual items without the procurement of competitive bids where the total amount of any such individual item does not exceed $2,500.\n            (c) The receiver shall collect the accrued and accruing rents, issues and profits of the eligible building and apply the same to the cost of the corrective actions authorized in subparagraph (b) of this paragraph, to the payment of expenses reasonably necessary to the proper operation and management of the eligible building, including insurance and the fees of the managing agent, and the necessary expenses of his or her office as receiver, the repayment of all moneys advanced to the receiver by the department of housing preservation and development to cover the costs incurred by the receiver and interest thereon; and then, if there be a surplus, to unpaid taxes, assessments, water rents, sewer rents and penalties and interest thereon, and then to sums due to mortgagees or lienors. If the income of the eligible building shall be insufficient to cover the cost of the repairs and improvements or the expenses reasonably necessary to the proper operation and management of  such eligible building and other necessary expenses of the receiver, the department of housing preservation and development shall advance to the receiver any sums required to cover such cost and expense and thereupon shall have a lien against such eligible building having the priority provided in article 8 of subchapter 5 of chapter 2 of title 27 of the administrative code for any such sums so advanced with interest thereon.\n            (d) The receiver shall be entitled to the same fees, commissions and necessary expenses as receivers in actions to foreclose mortgages. Such fees and commissions shall be paid into the fund created pursuant to section 27-2111 of the administrative code. The receiver shall be liable only in his or her official capacity for injury to person and property by reason of conditions of the eligible building in a case where an owner would have been liable; such receiver shall not have any liability in his or her personal capacity. The personnel and facilities of the department of housing preservation and development and the corporation counsel shall be availed of by the receiver for the purpose of carrying out his or her duties as receiver, and the costs of such services shall be deemed a necessary expense of the receiver.\n            (7) Discharge of receiver. The receiver shall be discharged upon rendering a full and complete accounting to the court when the actions herein authorized are completed and the cost thereof and all other costs authorized herein have been paid or reimbursed from the rents and income of the eligible building and the surplus money, if any, has been paid over to the owner or the mortgagee or lienor as the court may direct. However, at any time, the receiver may be discharged upon filing his or her account as receiver without affecting the right of the department of housing preservation and development to its lien. Upon the completion of the repairs and improvements, the owner, the mortgagee or any lienor may apply for the discharge of the receiver upon payment to the receiver of all moneys expended by him or her therefor and all other costs authorized by paragraph 6 of this subdivision which have not been paid or reimbursed from the rents and income of such eligible building.\n            (8) Recovery of expenses of receivership; lien of receiver.\n            (a) The expenditures made by the receiver pursuant to paragraph 6 of this subdivision shall, to the extent that they are not recovered from the rents and income of the eligible building collected by the receiver, constitute a debt of the owner and a lien upon such building and lot, and upon the rents and income thereof. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the provisions of article 8 of subchapter 5 of chapter 2 of title 27 of the administrative code shall govern the effect and enforcement of such debt and lien; references therein to the department shall, for purposes of this article be deemed to refer to the receiver and, after such receiver's discharge, the department of housing preservation and development.\n            (b) Failure to serve a copy of the order and notice required in the manner specified by paragraph 3 of this subdivision, or failure to serve any mortgagee or lienor with a copy of the order to show cause as required by subparagraph (c) of paragraph 4 of this subdivision, shall not affect the validity of the proceeding or the appointment of a receiver, but the rights of the department of housing preservation and development or of the receiver shall not in such event be superior to the rights of any mortgagee or lienor who has not been served as provided therein.\n            (c) Any mortgagee or lienor who at his or her expense corrects the violations to the satisfaction of the court pursuant to the provisions of subparagraph (c) of paragraph 5 of this subdivision shall have and be entitled to enforce a lien equivalent to the lien granted to the receiver in favor of the department of housing preservation and development hereunder. Any mortgagee or lienor who, following the appointment of a receiver by the court, shall reimburse the receiver and the department of housing preservation and development for all costs and charges as hereinabove provided shall be entitled to an assignment of the lien granted to the receiver in favor of the department of housing preservation and development.\n            (9) Obligations of owner not affected. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to relieve the owner of any civil or criminal liability incurred or any duty imposed by law by reason of acts or omissions of the owner prior to the appointment of a receiver; nor shall anything contained herein be construed to suspend during the receivership any obligation of the owner for the payment of taxes or other operating and maintenance expenses of the eligible building nor of the owner or any other person for the payment of mortgages or liens.\n            t. Rulemaking. Each agency or department to which functions are assigned by this section may adopt and promulgate rules and regulations for the effectuation of the purpose of this section.\n            u. State enabling law. This section is enacted pursuant to the provisions of subdivision 21 of section 489 of the real property tax law.\n            � 2.
