  "Summary": "This bill would require the department of citywide administrative services (DCAS) to create a workplace culture survey, to be completed by municipal employees annually on an anonymous and voluntary basis. The survey would ask employees about their opinions on their workplace culture, management practices, likelihood of departing the agency, and other equity-related concerns. This bill would require the commissioner of DCAS to submit a report on their findings from the survey responses. This bill would also clarify that agencies’ annual reports on their efforts to remedy pay disparities and occupational segregation should include both internal and external outreach.",
