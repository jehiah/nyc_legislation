ACS shall explain the purpose of such survey to youth and shall not attribute survey responses to youth without their consent. In addition to questions, such survey shall provide space for such youth to provide ACS with any additional information or feedback they wish to share. \n      [b.] c. Such survey shall include, but not be limited to, questions addressing the following topic areas: access to food and clothing; religious practices; relationships with foster families, biological families, and friends; personal allowances; education and extracurricular activities; internet and phone access; [and] experiences related to gender expression, gender identity, sex characteristics, and sexual orientation; identification as a member of the LGBTQIA+ community; racial identity; and placement type, including, but not limited to, kinship, nonkinship, and residential care. \n      [c.] d.
