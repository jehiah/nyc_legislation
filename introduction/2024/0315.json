  "Summary": "This bill would require that if an organization or individual requests a permit for an athletic field or court for a fifth consecutive year then the Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR) shall conduct an assessment of the use of such permit by such organization or individual to determine whether they have engaged in any activity (i.e., violating DPR rules) that would preclude the issuance of permits to such applicants in the future.",
