  "TextID": 77503,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Subdivision p of section 19-502 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 37 for the year 2019, is amended to read as follows:\n      p. \"Commuter van\" means a commuter van service having a seating capacity of at least nine passengers but not more than twenty passengers or such greater capacity as the commission may establish by rule and carrying passengers for hire in the city duly licensed as a commuter van by the commission and [not] permitted to accept hails from prospective passengers in the street. For purposes of the provisions of this chapter relating to prohibitions against the operation of an unauthorized commuter van service or an unlicensed commuter van, the enforcement of such prohibitions and the imposition of penalties for violations of such prohibitions and to the seizure and forfeiture of commuter vans, the term shall also include any common carrier of passengers by motor vehicle not subject to licensure as a taxicab, for-hire vehicle, or wheelchair accessible van and not operating as a public or private bus transit service operated pursuant to a contract with the city, any county within the state of New York, the state of New York or any other state or local government that follows the applicable procurement rules and regulations of such jurisdiction regardless of the seating capacity of any such vehicle. The commission shall submit to the council the text of any proposed rule relating to the maximum capacity of commuter vans at the time such proposed rule is published in the City Record.\n      � 2. Paragraph (1) of subdivision a of section 19-504 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 115 for the year 1993, is amended to read as follows:\n      (1) A [taxi-cab,] taxicab, coach, wheelchair accessible van, commuter van or for-hire vehicle shall operate within the city of New York only if the owner shall first have obtained from the commission a taxicab, coach, wheelchair accessible van, commuter van or for-hire vehicle license for such vehicle and only while such license is in full force and effect. Vehicle licenses shall be issued for a term of not less than one nor more than two years and shall expire on the date set forth on the license unless sooner suspended or revoked by the commission. No motor vehicle other than a duly licensed taxicab or commuter van shall be permitted to accept hails from passengers in the street. No commuter van shall be operated within the city of New York unless it is operated as part of a current, valid authorization to operate a commuter van service duly issued by the commission pursuant to section 19-504.2 of this chapter.\n      � 3. Subdivision b of section 19-516 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 6 for the year 2017, is amended to read as follows:\n      b. [No commuter van service and no person who owns, operates or drives a commuter van, shall provide, permit or authorize the provision of transportation service to a passenger unless such service to a passenger is on the basis of a telephone contract or other prearrangement. Where a violation of this subdivision has been committed by a driver of a commuter van, the commuter van service and the owner of such vehicle shall also be liable for a violation of this subdivision.] A commuter van may accept hails from passengers in the street in addition to accepting passengers on the basis of telephone contract or other prearrangement.\n      � 4. Subdivisions 11 and 12 of section 19-529.7 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 7 for the year 2017, are amended and a new paragraph 13 is added to such section to read as follows:\n      11. a discussion of how commuter van service areas are selected; [and]\n      12. whether, in the judgment of the commission, there is a need for commuter vans in a number exceeding the number specified in subdivision r of section 19-504;\n      13. an evaluation of the impact, if any, of authorizing commuter vans to accept hails from passengers in the street on the safe and efficient operation of commuter van services.\n      � 5. This local law takes effect immediately.\n\nEH\nLS #15897\n5/21/2024 10:20 AM\n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      3\n      \n      \n      1",
