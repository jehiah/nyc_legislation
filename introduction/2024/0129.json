  "Summary": "This local law would mandate, with respect to all city-owned, or leased or operated parking lots receiving solar radiation, that the Department of Citywide Administrative Services install all solar canopies that would be cost-effective at each city-controlled parking lot. In addition for each city controlled parking lot a number of parking spaces equal to or greater than 50 percent of the parking spaces covered by such canopies shall be equipped with electrical raceways capable of supporting electric vehicle charging stations and shall be installed in each city controlled parking lot where a solar canopy is installed. This local law would require reporting every five years on, among other things, the value of energy produced by solar canopies on city-controlled parking lots and a summary of how such energy was used and a description of each factor that has affected the cost-effectiveness of installing solar canopies on city-controlled parking lots.",

The term \"solar canopy\" means a system designed and constructed to capture solar radiation for the purpose of producing usable energy.\n      b. 1.
