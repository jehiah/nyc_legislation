  "Summary": "This bill would require the Commissioner of the Department of Parks and Recreation (Parks) to install security cameras in city parks. Security cameras would be installed in at least 25 percent of all city parks every two years after the local law goes into effect, until all city parks have cameras installed. The Commissioner would consider the number of major felony crime complaints in each park when determining which parks to prioritize. The Commissioner of Parks would work in consultation with the Commissioner of the New York Police Department (NYPD) to install the cameras in areas where crime is likely to occur.",
