  "Summary": "This bill would require an agency or office designated by the Mayor to divide each Sanitation District into three or more subdivisions, to be referred to as Sanitation Sections, and inspect and assign a cleanliness grade to a sample of streets within each Sanitation Section at least twice per month. The bill also would require the agency to post on its website, on a quarterly basis, a cleanliness grade for each inspected sample of streets, a description of any factors observed that contributed to such grade, a list of streets included in such sample, and a cleanliness grade for the sample’s larger corresponding Sanitation Section and Sanitation District. Additionally, the bill would require the agency to re-inspect low-graded samples and to publish an updated cleanliness grade. The bill would also require the agency to use cleanliness grades to inform where to direct its resources.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n      Section 1. Chapter 1 of title 16 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 16-146 to read as follows:\n      � 16-146 Street cleanliness grading system. a. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms have the following meanings:\n      Administering agency. The term \"administering agency\" means the department or an agency or office designated by the mayor to administer the street cleanliness grading system established by this section.\n      Cleanliness grade. The term \"cleanliness grade\" means a letter rating assigned by the administering agency for street and sidewalk segments that accounts for the following factors: (i) the prevalence of inorganic litter; (ii) the presence of discarded bulky items inappropriately set out for collection; (iii) any prohibited dumping, as set forth in section 16-119; (iv) conditions conducive to pests; and (v) any other factors as determined by the administering agency.\n      Conditions conducive to pests. The term \"conditions conducive to pests\" means conditions of property and sidewalk maintenance that promote or allow for the establishment of pest populations, their feeding, breeding and proliferation, and foster the creation of harborage conditions. Such conditions may include but are not limited to: the presence of weeds or other vegetation that are sources of food or shelter for rodents; accumulation of refuse and other material in or on which pests may find shelter, hide or nest; the presence of food or other organic litter or water accessible to, and capable of, sustaining a pest population; or unsanitary conditions that attract pests. \n      Sanitation section. The term \"sanitation section\" means a geographically contiguous subdivision of a sanitation district, as determined by the administering agency provided that no individual subdivision shall represent more than one-third of such sanitation district.\n      b. The administering agency shall establish and implement a system for assigning each sanitation section in the city a cleanliness grade for both streets and sidewalks no less than 4 times per year.\n      c. The administering agency shall inspect a sample of streets and sidewalks in every sanitation section no less than twice per month. Within each sample, the administering agency shall include the equivalent at least 3 percent of all streets located within the sanitation section. The administering agency shall diversify the specific streets included in each sample inspected such that the samples inspected over 1 year portray a comprehensive rating of the sanitation section. \n      d. The administering agency shall use the cleanliness grades to inform which sanitation districts and sanitation sections require additional resources and redirect such resources.\n      1. The administering agency shall revisit a sample of streets and sidewalks which received a low rating and perform a re-inspection and grading of such sample within 1 year of such low rating. After performing re-inspection of such sample of streets and sidewalks, the administering agency shall publicly post on its website the updated cleanliness grade of such sample of streets and sidewalks with a description of any factors observed during the re-inspection contributing to the cleanliness grade. The updated cleanliness grade shall be reported separate from the reporting requirements set forth in subdivision e of this section.\n      e. The administering agency shall publicly post on its website, no less than once each quarter:\n      1. a list of specific streets included in each inspected sample and when such sample was inspected;\n      2. the cleanliness grade given to a particular sample of streets following inspection;\n      3. a description of any factors observed during inspection of a particular sample of streets which contributed to the cleanliness grade;\n      4. the overall cleanliness grade for a sanitation section, based on cleanliness grades given to samples of streets within such section over the previous reporting cycle; and\n      5. the overall cleanliness grade for a sanitation district, based on cleanliness grades given to sanitation sections within such district over the previous reporting cycle.\n      � 2.
