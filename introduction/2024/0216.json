  "Summary": "This bill would require the agency administering the New York City Identity Card (IDNYC), currently the Department of Social Services, to implement various changes to improve the IDNYC application process. These changes include: (1) showing appointments at each location for the earliest available date and time on any online appointment scheduling system; (2) developing an annual training program for IDNYC employees on the application process; (3) providing for adequate in-person application appointments to match demand for the IDNYC; (4) establishing a pilot program to permit same-day and walk-in appointments at certain IDNYC service enrollment centers; and (5) providing a process in which a supervisor is available to review documentation that has been declined during an application appointment for an IDNYC.",
