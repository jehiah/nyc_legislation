  "Summary": "This bill would require biennial inspections of steam radiators located in apartments where a child under 6 resides and in the common areas of such buildings. If an inspection reveals a defect or damage to a steam radiator, the building owner would be required to correct such defect within 14 days of the inspection, while the discovery of any condition hazardous to life or safety would require the building owner to remove the steam radiator from service within 24 hours of the inspection and repair or replace the steam radiator within 7 days. Building owners would be required to maintain records of each inspection, and be subject to civil penalties for insufficient recordkeeping. Inspection requirements would not apply to owner-occupied condominiums and cooperatives.",
