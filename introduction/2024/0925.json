Inspection of a steam radiator would also be required if owner knows or has reason to know about a potential defect or damage of the radiator. The inspection would be conducted by a licensed plumber or someone under the supervision of a licensed plumber. Owners would be required to provide inspection reports, repair or replace any radiators with damage or a defect, and present notice to occupants to determine if a child under 6 resides in each unit. Owners would be liable for civil penalties for failure to comply with these requirements.",
