In connection with each covered land use action certified by the city planning commission on or after January 1, 2019, the department or, if the city planning commission is not the lead agency, the lead agency, in coordination with the department of transportation, shall conduct studies of transportation impacts in the relevant study area for the following periods: \n      1. from the date of final approval of such covered land use action to a date four years after such final approval; and\n      2. from the date of final approval of such covered land use action to a date 10 years after such final approval. \n      c.
