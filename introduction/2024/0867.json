Two years after DOHMH adopts such threshold levels by rule, this bill would prohibit the sale, offer for sale and distribution of menstrual products or intimate care products that contain such substance at or above such threshold level. Violations would be punishable by a civil penalty not to exceed $250 for each violation.",
