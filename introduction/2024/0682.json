  "Summary": "This bill would provide that a failure to obtain a valid Place of Assembly Certificate of Operation from the Department of Buildings, in a case where beverages are offered for sale to be consumed on the premises, would be classified as an immediately hazardous violation. A violation for failing to comply with requirements regarding security guards for a Place of Assembly would also be specified as an immediately hazardous violation. Such requirements regarding security guards would also be expanded to apply to a lessee of a Place of Assembly.",
