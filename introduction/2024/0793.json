  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation to conduct a pilot program to study materials that are known or reasonably believed to result in lower emissions of carbon dioxide and secondary organic aerosols as alternatives to asphalt in street resurfacing and construction projects and to provide a report on the results of such study.",
  "TextID": 76937,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Alternatives to asphalt pilot program. a. Definitions. For purposes of this local law, the following terms have the following meanings:\n      Bio-bitumen. The term \"bio-bitumen\" means a combination of plastic, organic materials, paper and textile waste, heated to approximately 500 degrees Celsius in the absence of oxygen, to form a substance similar to asphalt.\n      Secondary organic aerosol. The term \"secondary organic aerosol\" means an air pollutant that is formed by the oxidation of volatile organic compounds.\n      b. The department of transportation shall establish a pilot program to study the use of materials other than asphalt or asphaltic concrete, as those words are defined in section 19-101 of the administrative code of the city of New York, for street resurfacing and street construction projects. The pilot program shall, at a minimum: \n      1. Use materials such as solar panels, organic-based products, recycled plastic and bio-bitumen, or other similar materials that are known or reasonably believed to result in lower emissions of carbon dioxide and secondary organic aerosols, as determined by the commissioner of transportation, as replacements for asphalt and asphaltic concrete; and\n      2. Include no less than one street resurfacing or street construction project, which location shall be determined by the department of transportation.\n      c. No later than the first anniversary of the effective date of this local law, the commissioner of transportation, in consultation with the commissioner of environmental protection, shall submit to the mayor and to the speaker of the council, and post on the department of transportation's website, a report, which shall include, but not be limited to, the following: \n      1. The total cost of such pilot program, including projected cost of expanding and maintaining such a program;\n      2. An analysis of the effectiveness of the materials used pursuant to subdivision b of this section with respect to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental benefits as determined by the department of transportation;\n      3. An analysis of the use and limitations of the materials used pursuant to subdivision b of this section on city streets; and\n      4. Recommendations for implementing a permanent city program to explore and use alternatives to asphalt in street resurfacing and street construction projects.\n      ï¿½ 2. This local law takes effect immediately.\n\n\n\n\n\nSession 13\nLS #5414\n1/10/24\n\nSession 12\nNAB\nLS #5414\n1/13/22\n        \n\n      1\n      \n      \n      2",
