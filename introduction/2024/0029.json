  "Summary": "This bill would require the Director of the New York City Office to End Gender-Based Violence, in consultation with the New York City Fire Commissioner and Police Commissioner, to develop a training program for first responders on how to recognize and respond to traumatic brain injuries (TBI) that may result from domestic violence. The training, which would be developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders and subject matter experts, would cover topics such as the prevalence and causes of TBI among domestic violence survivors, how to identify symptoms, how to respond to support individuals in emergencies, and the long-term health impacts of repeated brain injuries. New recruits in the New York City Police and Fire Departments would be required to receive this training at the academy, and current first responders who regularly work with crime victims would receive refresher training at least every two years. The bill would also require the City to run a public awareness campaign to increase understanding and reduce stigma around brain injuries related to domestic violence. The campaign would include informational materials—available both online and in print and in multiple languages—about symptoms, risks, and available resources. Finally, the bill would establish an advisory panel made up of City officials and subject matter experts to review and update the training and campaign materials every two years.",
