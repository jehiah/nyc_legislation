  "Summary": "This bill would require the City to provide training to first responders and service providers about the connection between domestic violence and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Such training would include information relating to the prevalence of TBI among domestic violence survivors, how to identify symptoms of TBI, how to respond to the needs of individuals with TBI, and the long-term health impacts of repeated brain injuries. This bill would also require the department of health and mental hygiene to collaborate with the mayor’s office to end domestic and gender-based violence to conduct an awareness campaign on the connection between domestic violence and traumatic brain injury.",
