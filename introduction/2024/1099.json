Specifically it would require the city to report on the number of employees whose employment status have been impacted by the use of such tool; including the number funded agency positions eliminated due to the use of such tool, the number of funded agency positions for which there was any displacement, the number of salaries changed due to changes in responsibility due to use of such tool, and the number of city employees who were required to undertake any new trainings due to the use of an algorithmic tool.",
