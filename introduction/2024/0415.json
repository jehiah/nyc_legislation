  "Summary": "This bill would expand the ground floor and second floor commercial premises registry to require the registration of all commercial premises, and would require owners of those premises to disclose vacancy information including the total square footage of vacant premises, the date the premises became vacant, and how long they have been vacant. This bill would also expand the registration statement requirement for residential properties to require the disclosure of the number of dwelling units and their vacancy status, including the date the dwelling unit became vacant, how long they have been vacant, and whether currently vacant units are habitable, or the reason that they are uninhabitable.",
