Appropriations to the department for mental health, intellectual and developmental disability, and alcoholism services shall be set forth in the expense budget in separate and distinct units of appropriation. In determining the annual amount of city funds to be appropriated by the city for mental health, intellectual and developmental disability, and alcoholism services, the following provision shall apply: in the event that the executive budget proposes a decrease in city funds measured against the budget for the current fiscal year, as modified in accordance with section 107, for the units of appropriation for mental health, intellectual and developmental disability, and alcoholism services, the executive budget shall not propose a greater percentage decrease in city funds measured against the budget for the current fiscal year, as modified in accordance with section 107, for the units of appropriation for mental health, intellectual and developmental disability, and alcoholism services than has been proposed for the units of appropriation for public health services.

The New York city clerk shall take all necessary steps to effectuate the provisions of this section in accordance with law.\n      � 7. This local law takes effect immediately upon certification that it has been approved by the electors; provided, however, that any office subject to advice and consent of the council pursuant to the amendments to section 31 of the New York city charter made by section one of this local law that is vacant on such effective date, will be deemed to have become vacant on such effective date.\n\n\n\nLS 16644\n5/29/2024\n      5\n      \n      \n      1",
