  "Summary": "This bill would double the required level of lighting under sidewalk sheds from 45 lumens per watt or greater to 90 lumens per watt or greater, and would require that lighting under sidewalk sheds be provided specifically by LED lights. Additionally, this bill would require lighting fixtures serving a sidewalk shed that is within a 20-foot radius of a window, glass door, or any other fenestration of a dwelling unit to be equipped with directional adjustment or shielding to eliminate light trespass toward the dwelling unit.",
