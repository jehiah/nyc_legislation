  "Summary": "This bill would require moped repair shops to obtain a license in order to operate their business in the City. The application term would be two years, and there would be a biennial fee of $200. The department of consumer and worker protection could refuse to issue or renew a license, or suspend or revoke a license if the moped repair shop violates the conditions of the license. Moped repair shops that violate license conditions would be subject to penalties determined by the department. Prior to repair, licensees would confirm the registration of mopeds intended for use on a public highway or street.",
