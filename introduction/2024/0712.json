  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Correction (“DOC”) to develop and implement a plan, in consultation with Correction Health Services (“CHS”) to address medical appointments during and after a lock-in. The plan would require DOC to provide CHS with adequate notice of an impending lock-in when possible and DOC and CHS to communicate during and after a lock-in. The plan would also require CHS to determine the order in which individuals who were not produced for a medical appointment due to a lock-in are produced, based on medical necessity, and DOC to continue to escort patients to medical appointments, whenever practicable. \r\nThis bill would also require DOC to report when mental health units are locked down pursuant to a lock-in and how services were supplemented during that time, and CHS to report on the number of missed appointments due to a lock-in.",
