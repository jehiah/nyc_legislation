  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department for the Aging (DFTA), in consultation with the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications and the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP), to develop printed and digital informational materials to educate older adults about internet scams, phone scams, and phishing scams, and provide quarterly guidance to older adult centers about emerging scams. The bill would also require that DFTA post a digital version of the informational materials on its website, and would require the Commissioner for the Aging to ensure that such informational materials are distributed to homebound older adults and that older adult centers distribute such informational materials to older adults in their facilities. Additionally, this bill would require DFTA, in consultation with DCWP, to develop printed and digital informational materials to educate older adults about financial literacy and end of life preparation.",
