  "Summary": "This bill would require the New York City Police Department, within 48 hours of a determination that a violent or traumatic incident has occurred, to notify the Mayor’s Office of Community Mental Health (OCMH) and any additional mayoral office or agency designated by the mayor, of such incident. A violent or traumatic incident would mean any incident or series of incidents that can cause severe emotional and mental distress to the public, such as a violent act or series of violent acts that cause death or any other incident or incidents that may be shocking, traumatic, or dangerous to the community. Upon receiving notice of a violent or traumatic incident, OCMH and any additional agencies and offices would be required to conduct outreach to local community members regarding the availability of mental health resources in the city, such as the 988 suicide and crisis hotline.",
