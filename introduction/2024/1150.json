  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to develop a comprehensive stormwater plan that recommends capacities at which the stormwater system should be able to convey rainfall across New York City. The plan would also identify projects or policies necessary to achieve such capacities and to reduce stormwater flooding. Additionally, this bill requires DEP to develop and maintain a dashboard that indicates the status of the comprehensive stormwater plan and of any projects recommended by the plan.",
