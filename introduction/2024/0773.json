  "Summary": "This bill would require that the City’s Department of Transportation (“DOT”), prior to issuing a notice of violation requiring a property owner to repair a defect on a sidewalk abutting the owner’s property, to first determine if DOT or the Department of Parks and Recreation (“Parks”) already have plans to repair or upgrade the same section of sidewalk.  To avoid redundant work, DOT’s notice of violation should also notify the property owner of the planned DOT or Parks sidewalk repair or upgrade.  Where such planned sidewalk repair or upgrade would begin within 90 days, no notice should be given to the property owner.",
