  "Summary": "This bill would increase the number of allowable boarders, roomers, and lodgers in a private dwelling and short-term rentals in one- and two-family dwellings to 4, not including any children under the age of 18, provided that the permanent occupant has registered the property for use as a short-term rental. The bill would also allow permanent occupants to host guests without being physically present at the property, and would address the common household requirement, commonly known as the “unlocked doors provision”, as it relates to short-term rentals in one- and two-family dwellings, by requiring the permanent occupant hosting a short-term rental to provide boarders, roomers, or lodgers reasonable access to the dwelling unit, which need not include the bedrooms, offices, or other similar private spaces of any permanent occupant of the dwelling.",
