  "Summary": "This bill would require the Commission on Racial Equity (CORE) to work with subject experts to study the historical and present-day role of New York City government in perpetrating or perpetuating slavery and related racial injustices, and to consider reparative measures for such injustices. The reparations study would document the harms of slavery and its legacies in the City, identify associated rights violations, and recommend potential legal, policy and other measures to help remedy or redress associated harms. City agencies would be required to cooperate with any related special inquiries by CORE. Recommended measures may include monetary or non-monetary reparations, including symbolic measures such as public apologies or memorials. The study would also propose eligibility criteria for receiving reparations, and would coordinate with the New York State community commission on reparations remedies and the City’s process for Truth, Healing, and Reconciliation required by Int. 242-A.",
