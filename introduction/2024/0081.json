  "Summary": "The New York Social Services law and Family Court Act require that when a foster care placement changes, a social services agency or worker must provide the attorney for the child with notice of the change in placement. This bill would require the Administration for Children’s Services (ACS) to conduct quarterly audits of foster care placement notifications. The audit would include a review of instances in which a notice was not provided as required, the time elapsed between a change in foster care placement and when the placement notice was provided, when notice of the change was provided to the attorney for the child and a summary of the information that was missing from the notice. ACS would be required to report to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council, and post on the ACS website, a report with the results of its audit from the preceding quarter.",

Such audit shall include a review of the following: \n      1. The incidence of failure to provide a notice of placement change where required by law;\n      2. The amount of time that elapsed between changes in foster care placement and the provision of the placement change notice;\n      3.
