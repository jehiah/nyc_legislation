  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Finance, in collaboration with the Department of Education, to conduct a feasibility study on establishing a universal school voucher program that provides parents with an annual $10,000 tuition reimbursement payment for each student enrolled in a nonpublic school and report on the findings of the study. The report would include a cost analysis, assess the potential impact to public schools, identify the agency responsible for distributing payments and identify barriers to implementation.",
