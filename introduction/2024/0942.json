  "Summary": "This bill would require property owners other than New York City to replace lead water service lines, and to obtain a certification stating that the property does not have a lead service line, within 10 years. Owners who make up to 50% of the Area Median Income would be eligible for financial assistance from the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). Any City permit fees required to replace a service line would be waived. DEP would need to replace a service line in a property where a child care program is located for free if DEP is notified. DEP would have to replace a lead service line if it conducts work on or affecting the line. Also, DEP would need to post on its website information on the replacement requirement and available City assistance. An owner that does not replace a lead service line by the deadline would be liable for a civil penalty of up to $1,000, and an owner that fails to obtain a timely certification would be liable for a civil penalty of up to $500.",
