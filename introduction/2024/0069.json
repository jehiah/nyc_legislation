  "Summary": "Under Title 8 of the Administrative Code, people have one year to file a complaint with the NYC Commission on Human Rights for an unlawful discriminatory practice or act of discriminatory harassment or violence and three years to file a claim of gender-based harassment. In addition, they may commence a civil action within three years. This bill would make unenforceable and void any provision of any employment agreement that purports to shorten such periods.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      Section 1. Section 8-109 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new subdivision (e-1) to read as follows:\n      (e-1) Any provision of an agreement involving an employer, employment agency, or agent thereof pertaining to terms of employment that purports to shorten the periods in which a complaint or claim may be filed pursuant to subdivision (e) is unenforceable and void as against public policy. Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to affect the enforceability of any provision of any agreement other than a provision limiting the period in which a complaint or claim may be filed. \n      � 2.
