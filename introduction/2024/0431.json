  "Summary": "This bill would gradually expand the number of licenses that are available to vend food and merchandise on the sidewalks of New York City. Each year, there would be 2,000 additional supervisory license applications and 2,100 additional general vendor license applications available to prospective vendors beginning in 2026 until 2031. This bill would also expand training, increase the rate of enforcement agents required to inspect street vendor setups, and authorize license suspension or revocation upon a finding of serious and persistent violations. This bill would require the Street Vendor Advisory Board to examine and make recommendations pertaining to the new requirements.",
  "TextID": 80677,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n      \n      Section 1. Section 13-e of the New York city charter, as amended by local law number 117 for the year 2024, is amended to read as follows:\n      Section 13-e. Office of street vendor enforcement.\n      There shall be an office of street vendor enforcement, which shall consist of enforcement agents who are specially trained in local laws and rules related to vending on the streets and sidewalks of the city of New York. The office of street vendor enforcement shall be fully operational on or before September 1, 2021 and shall commence enforcement activities on or before such date. Such enforcement activities shall, at a minimum, include a sufficient number of street patrols to inspect or examine the vending activities of at least [75] 80 percent of applicable permittees or licensees on an annual basis. For the purposes of this section, the term \"applicable permittees or licensees\" means persons issued full-term or temporary permits pursuant to section 17-307 of the administrative code, or persons issued licenses to vend pursuant to sections 17-307 or 17-307.1 of the administrative code, or licenses issued pursuant to section 20-456 of the administrative code. The mayor may establish such office in the executive office of the mayor, within any other office in the executive office of the mayor, or within any department, the head of which is appointed by the mayor. Such office shall have the power and duty to:\n      a. enforce all local laws and rules related to vending on the streets and sidewalks and in parks of the city of New York, other than such local laws and rules related to food safety, including, but not limited to: section 16-118, subchapter 2 of chapter 3 of title 17, section 18-146, subchapter 27 of chapter 2 of title 20 and chapter 1 of title 24 of the administrative code; article 89 of the health code; and any rules of the city of New York implementing such laws;\n      b. focus its enforcement efforts on areas including, but not limited to, areas adjacent to retailers that dedicate substantial floor area to the sale of fresh fruits and vegetables, areas that are restricted to vending by sections 17-315 and 20-465 of the administrative code, and any other areas identified by the department of transportation as [excessively congested] a global corridor and featuring a high level of complaints about vendor activity, if any;\n      c. collaborate with the department of small business services to provide training, outreach and education to all street vendors on entrepreneurship and compliance with all applicable local laws and regulations, as well as solicit feedback from the street vendor community;\n      d. receive all complaints related to street vending on the streets and sidewalks of the city of New York from the 311 service center or from any other means; and\n      e. engage in such other activities related to enforcement of laws related to vending on the streets and sidewalks and in parks of the city of New York, or related to improving compliance with such laws, as may be designated by the mayor. For the purposes of this section, \"[excessively congested\" areas include, but are not limited to, areas where pedestrian volume regularly approaches or exceeds the capacity of the sidewalk] a global corridor\" is one of the five street categories assigned by the pedestrian mobility plan pursuant to section 19-199.1 of the administrative code.\n      � 2. Subparagraph a of paragraph 3 of subdivision b of section 17-307 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 18 for the year 2021, is amended to read as follows: \n      (a) (i) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph two of this subdivision limiting the number of full-term permits that are authorized to be issued, the commissioner may issue up to a maximum of 100 additional full-term permits authorizing the holders thereof to vend food from any vehicle or pushcart in any public place in the city of New York where food vendors are not prohibited from vending.

Paragraph 5 of subdivision b of section 17-307 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 18 for the year 2021, is amended to read as follows:\n      5. (a) On or after July 1, 2022 all new permits issued under this subchapter, except fresh fruits and vegetables permits, shall be designated for use only when any holder of a supervisory license is physically present and vending. Such requirement shall not apply to a permit issued before July 1, 2022 or a renewal thereof until [July 1, 2032] July 1, 2031. On or after [July 1, 2032] July 1, 2031, all permits issued under this subchapter, except fresh fruits and vegetables permits, shall be designated for use only when any holder of a supervisory license is physically present and vending.\n      (b) The commissioner shall make available for application [400] 1,800 supervisory licenses per twelve-month period for [ten] five consecutive years beginning on [July 1, 2022] July 1, 2026.

On or before [July 1, 2032] July 1, 2031, the commissioner shall make available for application supervisory licenses to any person seeking to renew a permit that was issued under this subchapter before July 1, 2022.\n      (c) In accordance with procedures to be established by rules of the commissioner, in each twelve month period, [100] 500 of the supervisory licenses made available for application under this paragraph shall be designated for use in any borough, and the remaining [300] 1,500 such supervisory licenses shall be designated for use in boroughs outside of Manhattan.\n      (d) Preferences shall be given in the availability of applications for supervisory licenses pursuant to this paragraph and in the placement on a waiting list therefor to the following categories of persons in the following order.\n      (i) Persons who have held a food vendor license continuously since on or before March 1, 2017 and have been on a waiting list for a full-term permit pursuant to subparagraph (e) of paragraph 2 of this subdivision and remain on such list as of the date an application is made available. Applications shall be made available to such persons by order of numerical rank on the waiting list.\n      (ii) Persons who have been on a waiting list for a full-term permit pursuant to this subchapter and remain on such list as of the date an application is made available but have not held a food vendor license continuously since on or before March 1, 2017.

Subdivision h of section 17-307 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 18 for the year 2021, is amended to read as follows:\n      h. No permit or license, including a supervisory license, shall be issued to a person required to have a permit or license pursuant to this subchapter unless such person obtains a certificate issued by the department subsequent to successful completion of a training developed or approved by the department on the vending restrictions contained in this section and any other information the department deems necessary to the safe operation of such vending unit, and passage of an examination administered by the department. Such training shall include information related to the particular vending restrictions of the prospective license holder. The department shall require renewal of such certificate every four years.
