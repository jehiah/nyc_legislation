  "Summary": "Subject to the approval of the New York State Urban Development Corporation, this bill would establish a land bank for New York City, which would have a board comprised of the mayor or their designee; the commissioner of finance or their designee; the commissioner of housing preservation and development or their designee; three persons appointed by the speaker of the council; and one person appointed by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council. The land bank would be empowered under state and local law to purchase tax liens from the city and to enforce such tax liens in accordance with policies and procedures intended to promote the goals of collecting outstanding revenues of the city; preserving ownership and equity interests in homes; preventing the displacement of residents from their dwellings; promoting proper and effective management of multiple dwelling residents; and preventing recidivism among properties with tax liens.",
  "TextID": 80896,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Declaration of legislative intent and findings. The Council hereby finds that the preservation of homeownership, prevention of displacement of residents from their dwellings, and maximization of the productive use of tax-foreclosed properties are crucial objectives in New York City's ongoing effort to ameliorate the inadequate supply of affordable housing. The Council finds that the City's practice of selling tax liens to a trust to enforce tax debts overlooks these objectives, resulting in suboptimal outcomes.\n      The Council further finds that the City should use every appropriate tool available to promote homeownership, access to affordable housing, and local economic revitalization, and that the City should coordinate its efforts and resources whenever possible to achieve these goals. The New York State Land Bank Act (Act) authorizes local governments to adopt local legislation to establish a land bank to use new State-created tools and funds to address the problems caused by vacant, abandoned, and tax-delinquent properties. Among other tools, the Act authorizes land banks to purchase tax liens from municipalities and to enforce such tax liens, including through foreclosure actions, subject to terms and conditions of sale set by the City. \n      The Council hereby declares that enactment of this law and establishment of a land bank are necessary to preserve the ownership and equity interests of homeowners, prevent the displacement of residents from their dwellings, and promote the productive use of tax-foreclosed, vacant, and abandoned properties to meet the needs of the surrounding community and city, in conjunction with the enforcement of tax liens.      \n      � 2. A land bank shall be established in the city of New York upon the review and approval by the urban development corporation of the local law that added this section. For purposes of this local law, the term \"land bank\" means the land bank established pursuant to this local law as a charitable not-for-profit corporation under the not-for-profit corporation law and in accordance with article 16 of such law.\n      � 3. Section 1-112 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 12 for the year 2024, is amended by adding a new subdivision 24 to read as follows:\n      24. \"The New York city land bank.\" The term \"New York city land bank\" means a land bank established pursuant to a local law for the year 2025, relating to creating a land bank, as proposed in introduction number 570-b.\n      � 4. Pursuant to subdivision (a) of section 1603 of the not-for-profit corporation law, the council hereby specifies the following:\n      a. The name of the land bank shall be \"New York City Land Bank.\"\n      b. There shall be 7 members of the board of directors of the land bank unless adjusted in accordance with the bylaws of the land bank.\n      c. 1. The individuals to serve as members of the board of directors of the land bank shall be:\n      (a) The mayor or their designee;\n      (b) The commissioner of finance or their designee;\n      (c) The commissioner of housing preservation and development or their designee;\n      (d) Three persons appointed by the speaker of the council; and\n      (e) One person appointed by the mayor, which appointment shall be made with the advice and consent of the council after a public hearing. Within 30 days after the first stated meeting of the council after receipt of a nomination for such appointment by the mayor, the council shall hold a hearing and act upon such nomination and in the event it does not act within such period, the nomination shall be deemed to be confirmed.\n      2. Each member of the board of directors shall serve a term of 4 years.\n      3. The initial individuals to serve as members of the board of directors shall be appointed in the same manner as set forth in paragraph 1 of this subdivision.  \n      4. Five members of the board of directors shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of conducting the business of such board.\n      d.

Declaration of legislative intent and findings. The Council hereby finds that the preservation of homeownership, prevention of displacement of residents from their dwellings, and maximization of the productive use of tax-foreclosed properties are crucial objectives in New York City\\rquote s ongoing effort to ameliorate the inadequate supply of affordable housing. The Council finds that the City\\rquote s practice of selling tax liens to a trust to enforce tax debts overlooks these objectives, resulting in suboptimal outcomes.\\par\nThe Council further finds that the City should use every appropriate tool available to promote homeownership, access to affordable housing, and local economic revitalization, and that the City should coordinate its efforts and resources whenever possible to achieve these goals. The New York State Land Bank Act (Act) authorizes local governments to adopt local legislation to establish a land bank to use new State-created tools and funds to address the problems caused by vacant, abandoned, and tax-delinquent properties. Among other tools, the Act authorizes land banks to purchase tax liens from municipalities and to enforce such tax liens, including through foreclosure actions, subject to terms and conditions of sale set by the City. \\par\nThe Council hereby declares that enactment of this law and establishment of a land bank are necessary to preserve the ownership and equity interests of homeowners, prevent the displacement of residents from their dwellings, and promote the productive use of tax-foreclosed, vacant, and abandoned properties to meet the needs of the surrounding community and city, in conjunction with the enforcement of tax liens.      \\par\n\\'a7 2.
