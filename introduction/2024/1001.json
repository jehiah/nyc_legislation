  "Summary": "This bill would require an office or agency designated by the mayor to establish an automated text message system that sends parents and guardians reminders and guidance about children’s health and development, including information like recommended medical checkups, vaccination schedules, and deadlines for early childhood education and public school enrollment. Parents and guardians would be able to sign up using just a phone number and choose to receive messages in multiple citywide languages. The office or agency would also be required to conduct an outreach campaign to parents, guardians, healthcare providers, doulas, and midwives about the program.",
