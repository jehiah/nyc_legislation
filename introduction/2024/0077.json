  "Summary": "This bill would reform the current system under which former city employees and public servants are allowed to lobby city government after they have left city service. Under this bill, former agency heads and high-level employees of the Mayor’s Office, the City Council, or the Law Department would be barred from lobbying any city agency for two years. High-level staffers at other agencies, boards, and commissions, as well as paid board members, would be prohibited from lobbying any city agency up to one year after they leave city service, and would be prohibited from lobbying their former agency for one additional year. This bill would make technical edits to the existing prohibitions barring elected officials from lobbying an agency within the branch of city government they served for two years, however, the substance of this portion of the law would not be changed as part of this legislation.",
