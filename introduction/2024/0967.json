Owners shall not allow a horse to be worked on a public highway, path, or street during adverse weather or other dangerous conditions [which] that are a threat to the health or safety of the horse. A horse being worked when such conditions develop shall be immediately returned to the stable by the most direct route. \n      g. [1. Carriage horses shall not be at work for more than nine hours in any continuous twenty-four hour period.] Riding horses shall not be at work for more than [eight] 8 hours in any continuous [twenty-four hour] 24-hour period. Rest periods for [carriage horses and] riding horses shall be of such duration and at such intervals as the commissioner shall prescribe[, but rest periods for carriage horses shall in no event be for less than fifteen minutes after each two hour working period, and the time of such rest period shall be included in calculating the number of hours the horse has worked in any twenty-four hour period. During such rest periods, the person in charge of such carriage horses shall make fresh water available to the horse. \n      2. Carriage horses shall receive no less than five weeks of vacation or furlough every twelve months at a horse stable facility which allows daily access to paddock or pasture turnout.

An owner shall be jointly liable with the person to whom a horse is rented for any violation of this subchapter or of any regulations promulgated hereunder committed by such person if the owner had knowledge or notice of the act which gave rise to the violation at the time of or prior to its occurrence or under the circumstances should have had knowledge or notice of such act and did not attempt to prevent it from occurring. \n      l.

A horse for which such an order has been issued shall not be returned to work until it has recovered from the condition which caused the issuance of the order or until such condition has improved sufficiently that its return to work will not aggravate the condition or otherwise endanger the health of the horse. In any proceeding, under this section it shall be presumed that a horse which is found at work within [forty-eight] 48 hours after the issuance of an order of removal and which is disabled by the same condition which caused such order to be issued has been returned to work in violation of this section. Such presumption may be rebutted by offering a certificate of a veterinarian indicating suitability to return to work prior to the expiration of the [forty-eight hour] 48-hour period. \n      n. Every horse required to be licensed hereunder shall be examined by a veterinarian prior to its use in a rental horse business, at time of each license renewal, and thereafter at intervals of not less than [four] 4 months and not greater than [eight] 8 months.

The examination shall also include a record of any injury, disease, or deficiency observed by the veterinarian at the time, together with any prescription or humane correction or disposition of the same. A signed health certificate by the examining veterinarian shall be maintained at the stable premises at which such horse is located and shall be displayed on the outside of [the] such horse's individual stall. An original of said certificate shall be mailed by the examining veterinarian to the department. \n          [o. 1. Carriage horses shall not be worked whenever the air temperature is 18 degrees fahrenheit or below. \n          2.

Relative humidity shall be determined by a state-of-the-art hygrometer or any other device having the same capability to measure relative humidity, as determined by the commissioner. Air temperatures and relative humidity shall be measured by the commissioner or the commissioner's designee at street level at one of the stands designated pursuant to section 19-174. \n          4. If either of the limits set by paragraph 2 of this subdivision are exceeded during the course of a particular ride, at the ride's conclusion, but no later than one-half hour after either of these limits are exceeded, the operator must immediately cease working, move the horse to an area of shelter, where available, rest the horse and then walk it directly to its stable. All horses so returned to their stable must be unbridled and unharnessed and remain at the stable for at least one hour, and thereafter, until such time as the weather conditions shall once again reach acceptable limits. \n          5. No violation of this subdivision shall occur unless a written warning of violation is first issued by the authorized enforcement personnel to the operator advising that either of the limits set in paragraph 2 of this subdivision have been exceeded and directing that the operator cease working a carriage horse in accordance with the provisions of this subdivision. A violation of this subdivision may be issued if an operator fails to comply with the direction contained in the written warning of violation. Failure to comply with such direction shall not be construed as a separate violation.\n          p. Every carriage horse required to be licensed hereunder shall be equipped with a manure catching device. Such devices shall be affixed or attached to the carriage and shall at no time be affixed or attached to the horse.\n          q. Carriage horses shall not be younger than five years at the time placed into service in any rental horse business and licensed. No carriage horse older than 26 years of age shall be licensed to work in a rental horse business. Acceptable proof of age shall include a signed letter from a licensed veterinarian stating the horse's age, a certificate from an officially recognized national registry of horses stating the horse's age, or another industry approved method of certifying age. \n          r. Owners shall insure that during the months of November through April every carriage is equipped with a heavy winter horse blanket large enough to cover the horse from crest of neck to top of rump. Such blankets shall be used to cover carriage horses in cold weather. Waterproof horse blankets of a lighter material shall be provided at all times to cover the horse from withers to tail during periods of wet weather when the air temperature is 55 degrees or below.] \n      � 5.

The provisions of this subchapter shall not be construed to prohibit the ASPCA or the department from enforcing any provision of law, rule, or regulation relating to the humane treatment of animals with respect to any horse regardless of whether such horse is required to be licensed pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter. \n      � 7.

Legislative findings. The legislative findings heretofore made in relation to the business of sight-seeing buses [and horse drawn cabs] in the city of New York and set forth in local law number [ten] 10 of [nineteen hundred sixty-four] 1964 continue to be valid; such businesses are vested with a public interest and their regulation and control continue to be necessary and essential in order to cope with certain evils and hazards which existed in the absence of governmental supervision. The supervision formerly was reposed in the police commissioner, but recent experience and study indicate that jurisdiction over such businesses should be transferred to the commissioner. [It is further found that the present number of horse drawn cabs licensed in the city of New York is adequate to meet the public need and demand and should be preserved, unless the commissioner finds that additional licenses are necessary and advisable.] \n      � 10.

[The commissioner shall issue additional licenses only after conducting a public hearing to determine whether the public convenience, welfare and necessity require the operation of additional horse-drawn cabs. The public hearing shall be called upon his or her own motion or upon written request by any applicant. Notice of such public hearing shall be published in the City Record once a week for two consecutive weeks and shall be mailed to all current licensees. If the commissioner shall determine that additional horse-drawn cabs are necessary and advisable, he or she shall certify the number of new licenses to be granted. Not more than one such public hearing shall be held during any calendar year and the commissioner may refuse to consider any request if it appears that a recent public hearing has adequately considered the question.

If the number of additional licenses authorized is insufficient to permit such allocation, then the distribution among those licensees entitled to the smallest number of additional licenses shall be made so that priority shall be given to those who have been uninterruptedly licensed for the longest period. New applicants for such additional licenses shall be considered only when the present licensees refuse to accept their allocation of licenses in the manner provided above.

The license plate issued to the licensee may, in the discretion of the commissioner, be a plate of a permanent nature with a replaceable date tag attached thereto, indicating the expiration date of the plate during each license year and the issuance of such a plate with such date tag to a person possessing such a plate, shall be deemed issuance of a license plate.
