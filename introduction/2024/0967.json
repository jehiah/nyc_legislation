  "Summary": "This bill would wind down the horse drawn cab industry by prohibiting the issuance of new licenses used in the operation of horse drawn cabs. The operation of such cabs would be prohibited beginning June 1, 2026. This bill would require humane disposition of carriage horses, prohibiting their sale or transfer for the purposes of slaughter or use in another horse drawn cab business. This bill would require the department of consumer and worker protection to administer a workforce development program for drivers and other workers engaged in the horse drawn cab industry in order to facilitate their transition to other fields of employment.",

An owner of a rental horse business shall keep such records as the commissioner [of health] shall prescribe including but not limited to a consecutive daily record of the movements of each licensed horse including the driver's name and identification number, if applicable, rider's name, the horse's identification number, vehicle license plate number, if applicable, time of leaving stable and time of return to stable.

The examination shall also include a record of any injury, disease, or deficiency observed by the veterinarian at the time, together with any prescription or humane correction or disposition of the same. A signed health certificate by the examining veterinarian shall be maintained at the stable premises at which such horse is located and shall be displayed on the outside of [the] such horse's individual stall. An original of said certificate shall be mailed by the examining veterinarian to the department. \n          [o. 1. Carriage horses shall not be worked whenever the air temperature is 18 degrees fahrenheit or below. \n          2. Carriage horses shall not be worked whenever (i) the air temperature is 90 degrees Fahrenheit or above, or (ii) the air temperature is 80 degrees Fahrenheit or above and the equine heat index is 150 or above. \n          3. For purposes of this subdivision, air temperatures shall be those measured by a state-of-the-art thermometer, as determined by the commissioner. Relative humidity shall be determined by a state-of-the-art hygrometer or any other device having the same capability to measure relative humidity, as determined by the commissioner. Air temperatures and relative humidity shall be measured by the commissioner or the commissioner's designee at street level at one of the stands designated pursuant to section 19-174. \n          4. If either of the limits set by paragraph 2 of this subdivision are exceeded during the course of a particular ride, at the ride's conclusion, but no later than one-half hour after either of these limits are exceeded, the operator must immediately cease working, move the horse to an area of shelter, where available, rest the horse and then walk it directly to its stable. All horses so returned to their stable must be unbridled and unharnessed and remain at the stable for at least one hour, and thereafter, until such time as the weather conditions shall once again reach acceptable limits. \n          5. No violation of this subdivision shall occur unless a written warning of violation is first issued by the authorized enforcement personnel to the operator advising that either of the limits set in paragraph 2 of this subdivision have been exceeded and directing that the operator cease working a carriage horse in accordance with the provisions of this subdivision. A violation of this subdivision may be issued if an operator fails to comply with the direction contained in the written warning of violation. Failure to comply with such direction shall not be construed as a separate violation.\n          p. Every carriage horse required to be licensed hereunder shall be equipped with a manure catching device. Such devices shall be affixed or attached to the carriage and shall at no time be affixed or attached to the horse.\n          q. Carriage horses shall not be younger than five years at the time placed into service in any rental horse business and licensed. No carriage horse older than 26 years of age shall be licensed to work in a rental horse business. Acceptable proof of age shall include a signed letter from a licensed veterinarian stating the horse's age, a certificate from an officially recognized national registry of horses stating the horse's age, or another industry approved method of certifying age. \n          r. Owners shall insure that during the months of November through April every carriage is equipped with a heavy winter horse blanket large enough to cover the horse from crest of neck to top of rump. Such blankets shall be used to cover carriage horses in cold weather. Waterproof horse blankets of a lighter material shall be provided at all times to cover the horse from withers to tail during periods of wet weather when the air temperature is 55 degrees or below.] \n      � 5. Paragraph 1 of subdivision a of section 17-331 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\n      1. Two members shall be appointed from among the owners of rental horse businesses operating within the city[, one of whom] who shall be representative of the interests of owners of riding horses [and one of whom shall be representative of the interests of owners of carriage horses].\n      � 6. Section 17-334 of the administrative code of the city of New York, subdivision a of such section as amended by local law number 80 for the year 2020, is amended to read as follows:\n      � 17-334 Construction. a. [The provisions of this subchapter shall not be construed to supersede or affect any of the provisions of subchapter twenty-one of chapter two of title twenty of the code relating to a \"horse drawn cab\" as defined therein or any of the regulations of the commissioner of consumer and worker protection promulgated thereunder.\n       b.] The provisions of this subchapter shall not be construed to permit the possession or use of a horse in any area where such possession or use is prohibited by any other law, rule, or regulation.\n       [c.] b. The provisions of this subchapter shall not be construed to prohibit the ASPCA or the department from enforcing any provision of law, rule, or regulation relating to the humane treatment of animals with respect to any horse regardless of whether such horse is required to be licensed pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter. \n      � 7. Section 17-334.1 of the administrative code of the city of New York is REPEALED.\n      � 8. Section 19-174 of the administrative code of the city of New York is REPEALED. \n      � 9. Section 20-371 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 31 for the year 1995, is amended to read as follows:  \n      � 20-371 Licensing of sight-seeing buses[, horse drawn cabs and horse drawn cab drivers]. Legislative findings. The legislative findings heretofore made in relation to the business of sight-seeing buses [and horse drawn cabs] in the city of New York and set forth in local law number [ten] 10 of [nineteen hundred sixty-four] 1964 continue to be valid; such businesses are vested with a public interest and their regulation and control continue to be necessary and essential in order to cope with certain evils and hazards which existed in the absence of governmental supervision. The supervision formerly was reposed in the police commissioner, but recent experience and study indicate that jurisdiction over such businesses should be transferred to the commissioner.
