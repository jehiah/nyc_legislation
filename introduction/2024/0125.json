Notably, the bill includes exceptions, such as when the DNA sample is collected from a minor who is alleged to be the victim of a criminal offense, and permits a minor’s DNA collection when abandoned at the scene of a crime, or otherwise gathered in circumstances where the minor is not in police custody, or recovered through interaction with law enforcement.",
