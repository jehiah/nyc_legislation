  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Social Services (DSS) to establish a system to obtain employment and income information from a third-party for the City’s use in making determinations for benefits and services eligibility. Such a system would enable DSS to access current employment and income verifications through a real-time, automated verification service provided by a third-party. This service would streamline the secure transfer of information and benefit applicants by reducing administrative burdens and creating an accelerated decision process on whether an applicant is eligible for a particular benefit, with the goal of having faster application review times, reducing case backlogs, and detecting instances of fraud in real-time.",
