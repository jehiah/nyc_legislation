  "Summary": "This bill would require New York City Emergency Management (NYCEM) to disseminate localized emergency preparedness materials in locations that are prone to flash floods, in order to increase public awareness as to the appropriate responses by members of the public to flash flood risks and to increase registration for an emergency notification system. Such efforts would involve outreach conduct in-person and via mass mailings, and target locations selected with consideration of: (i) a history of flash flood events; and (iii) the prevalence of subgrade dwellings. Additionally, NYCEM would be required to develop guidance for facilitating safe evacuation before flash flood emergencies.",
