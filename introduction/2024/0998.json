  "Summary": "This bill would codify New York City’s (“City” or “NYC”) cooling center program. The bill would require the Commissioner of the NYC Office of Emergency Management (NYCEM) to designate the locations of cooling centers when there is a heat-related emergency, and requires, where practicable, the designation of no fewer than 7 cooling centers per 100,000 residents. When determining where to locate cooling centers in the city, the bill would require the NYCEM Commissioner to consider factors such as areas in which vulnerable populations reside as well as the heat vulnerability index. In addition, the bill would require NYCEM or the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to post on its website any health alerts issued during a heat-related emergency. The bill would also require NYCEM to submit a comprehensive cooling and communication plan on or before May 15, 2026, as well as an annual report detailing the City’s efforts to inform the public about the availability and benefits of cooling centers, with recommendations on how to increase accessibility. Finally, the bill would require that NYCEM provide information for the public on how to submit feedback about their experiences at cooling centers, and to report any challenges with accessing such centers.",

The term \"heat index\" means a measurement of the combined air temperature and relative humidity that estimates the human-perceived equivalent temperature.\n      Heat vulnerability index. The term \"heat vulnerability index\" means a tool used by the department of health and mental hygiene to identify neighborhoods where residents have an increased risk of negative impacts from heat-related emergencies or other extreme heat events, considering environmental and social factors such as surface temperatures, access to green spaces, and air-conditioned buildings.\n      Heat-related emergency. The term \"heat-related emergency\" means [a circumstance during which the National Weather Service issues its heat advisory products] an occurrence of high temperatures or other circumstances during which the national weather service issues a warning or alert relating to extreme heat, or during which the commissioner of health and mental hygiene determines that the level of the heat index is [deemed to be] unsafe or unhealthy for vulnerable populations[, as determined by the commissioner of health and mental hygiene]. \n      Urban heat island effect. The term \"urban heat island effect\" means the increase in urban air temperature as compared to surrounding suburban and rural temperature.\n      Vulnerable population. The term \"vulnerable population\" means any group of persons at a greater risk of harm from a heat-related emergency than a person in the general population, as determined by the commissioner of health and mental hygiene in consideration of factors including, but not limited to, the heat vulnerability index.\n      b.

The commissioner shall update such plan by no later than May 15 of each year. Such plan shall include, but not be limited to, the following:\n      1. a mechanism to assess the city's cooling needs generally and the cooling needs of vulnerable populations during heat-related emergencies; \n      2. a description of how the commissioner [of emergency management] and the commissioner of health and mental hygiene will communicate to residents the dangers of heat exposure, including information about the urban heat island effect, the heat index, heat-related emergencies and other relevant information pursuant to this section;\n      3. a description of the temperature, heat index and other conditions under which the city will make cooling centers and other heat relief mechanisms available to the public; \n      4. information regarding access to cooling centers designated pursuant to this section and other heat relief mechanisms including: (a) whether such cooling centers can be safely opened; (b) the feasibility of infection and disease control in such centers, including a description of any necessary procedures to promote infection and disease control and any appropriate cleaning, if applicable; (c) a list of potential locations of cooling centers by street address, cross streets, and ZIP code; (d) the potential hours of operations, maximum capacity, and accessibility for individuals with disabilities for each such center; (e) the link to the cooling center finder which also includes notation of which cooling centers are accessible; and (f) other citywide operational strategies for cooling such as spray caps and homeless outreach;\n      5. a description of [how the commissioner of emergency management and the commissioner of health and mental hygiene will communicate the information in paragraphs 3 and 4 of this subdivision to residents on or before June 1 of each year] the public education campaign required by subdivision e of this section;\n      6. if cooling centers are not expected to be open or if they will be insufficient to serve the needs of vulnerable populations, a description of how the city will provide such vulnerable populations with cooling during a heat-related emergency, including but not limited to the direct provision of, and support for, residential cooling mechanisms, and a description of how the commissioner [of emergency management] will communicate this information to vulnerable populations;\n      7. a description of how the commissioner [of emergency management] and the commissioner of health and mental hygiene, or any other office or agency [they deem relevant], will provide public communications, written or otherwise, in the designated citywide languages, as defined in section 23-1101, and whether communications in any additional languages are needed based on the demographics of current or anticipated vulnerable populations;\n      8. an evaluation of the measures taken to reduce the impact of heat-related emergencies and the number of heat-related deaths during the previous summer seasons and a description of the measures the commissioner [of emergency management] and the commissioner of health and mental hygiene will take to further reduce the impact of heat-related emergencies and the number of heat-related deaths in the upcoming summer season; and\n      9. a plan for office buildings to set thermostats at or above a specific temperature to reduce stress on the electric grid, including a description of the heat conditions during which such a plan would be recommended, a recommendation on the temperature or temperatures to which such thermostats should be set, and a description of how to promote compliance with such plan when recommended. \n      [c.
