  "Summary": "This bill would establish an interagency task force for the purpose of studying the maximum number of persons who may be served by an individual FDNY firehouse or EMS dispatch station. The task force would also study projected changes to City population, zoning and traffic, and the impact of both on existing FDNY and EMS response resources, and report to the Mayor and the City Council on their findings and recommendations.",
