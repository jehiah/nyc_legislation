  "Summary": "This bill would update section 40 of the Charter to reflect the creation of the Twelfth and Thirteenth Judicial Districts. Currently, section 40 permits any supreme court justice “in the first, second or eleventh judicial district” to resolve disputes regarding the validity of voter petitions to amend the Charter. When the Legislature reassigned Bronx County to the Twelfth District and Richmond County to the Thirteenth District, it did not update section 40 accordingly. This bill would make the necessary updates to section 40 to clarify that justices in Bronx and Richmond Counties continue to be able to resolve disputes regarding the validity of Charter amendment petitions.",
