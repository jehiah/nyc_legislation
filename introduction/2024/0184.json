  "Summary": "This bill would prohibit surgical devocalization of healthy cats and dogs for non-therapeutic purposes. Devocalization procedures would only be permitted when medically necessary and performed by a licensed veterinarian on a cat or dog under anesthesia. The penalty for performing a non-therapeutic devocalization procedure would be at least $1,000 or at most $2,500. A veterinarian who performs a non-therapeutic devocalization procedure would be subject to reporting by the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene to the State Department of Education and Board of Regents for disciplinary action due to unprofessional conduct.",
