  "Summary": "This bill would require that the Mayor designate an agency/office, in coordination with the Department of Parks and Recreation and the Department of Transportation, to develop a report that proposes a capital project plan and implementation timeline for the installation and maintenance of public bathroom facilities at each of the sites to be identified pursuant to introduction number 258-A. The report would further propose a scope of project, estimated costs, potential funding sources, and appropriate maintenance schedules for each facility. The bill would also require the lead agency/office to consider relevant population data and social and equity indicators and to consult with qualified city entities regarding foreseeable challenges to the facilities’ installation and maintenance.",
