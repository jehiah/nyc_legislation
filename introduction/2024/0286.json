  "Summary": "This bill would require micro-fulfillment businesses, operators of what are often referred to as “dark stores,” to obtain a license in order to do business in the City. Application terms would be determined by the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, and there would be a biannual fee of $200. The department could refuse to issue or renew a license, or suspend or revoke a license, if the micro-fulfillment center violates the conditions of the license, including engaging in misleading advertising or deceptive trade practices. Micro-fulfillment businesses that violate license conditions may also be subject to penalties determined by the department.",
