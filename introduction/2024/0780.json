  "Summary": "This bill would allow safe/sick time under the City’s Earned Safe and Sick Time Act (ESSTA) to be used to provide care for a child or care recipient, to attend a legal proceeding for subsistence benefits or housing, to respond to a public disaster or to respond to workplace violence. This bill would also provide an additional 32 hours of unpaid safe/sick time under ESSTA, which would be available for use immediately upon hire and subsequently on the first day of each calendar year. The unpaid safe/sick time would replace the two days that were provided by the City’s Temporary Schedule Change Act (TSCA), however, employees would still be able to request temporary changes to their work schedule subject to approval by their employer.",

An employer may require reasonable notice of the need of use safe/sick time. Where such need is foreseeable, an employer may require reasonable advance notice of the intention to use such safe/sick time, not to exceed [seven] 7 days prior to the date such safe/sick time is to begin.
