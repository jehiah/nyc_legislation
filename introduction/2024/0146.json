  "Summary": "Employers are increasingly requiring their employees to sign non-compete agreements as a condition of employment, even in low-wage jobs where such provisions do not serve an obvious purpose. These covenants can lead to low-wage employees being unreasonably restricted in finding new jobs. This bill would prohibit employers from requiring low-wage employees to enter into covenants not to compete as a condition of their employment.",

Chapter 5 of title 22 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 22-511 to read as follows:\n\t� 22-511 Prohibition of covenants not to compete for low-wage employees. \n      a.
