  "Summary": "This bill would create an enforcement scheme for repeat violators of the City’s Human Rights Law (HRL). Under the scheme, repeat violators must carry out a remedial anti-discrimination plan, subject to supervision by the City Commission for Human Rights (CCHR), for a period of 1 to 5 years. The supervision period may be extended for noncompliance with the plan or for additional violations of the HRL. CCHR must consider imposing a supervised remedial plan any time a covered entity violates the HRL three times in a two-year span. This bill would also require CCHR to conduct a public information campaign on best practices for places of public accommodation, including educational institutions, to comply with the HRL.",
