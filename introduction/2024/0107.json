  "Summary": "This bill requires the Department of Enviromental Protection (DEP) to designate heavy-use thoroughfares in every borough, and install street level air monitors at a minimum at two major intersections on every designated heavy use thoroughfare and at every park or playground adjacent to a heavy use thoroughfare.  The bill also requires the issuance of a report to the mayor and to the speaker of the council containing the results of the air quality monitoring of designated heavy use thoroughfares and recreational areas. Where the results of the air quality monitoring indicate that levels of any regulated air contaminant constitute a violation of an existing standard, DEP along with the Department of Transportation and the Department of Education shall implement mitigation measures that reduce exposure risks.",
