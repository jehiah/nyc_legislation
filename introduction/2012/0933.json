  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection 1.  Legislative Findings.  The Council finds that animal cruelty is a serious problem in New York City.  Although New York State criminalizes cruelty to animals, animals in New York City continue to be subject to abusive behavior.  In recent years, several states and municipalities have considered creating animal abuse registries to track people convicted of animal cruelty.  As of 2013, four New York State counties had created animal abuse registries. The Council finds that creating a registry of those convicted of animal cruelty will aide those involved in the sale or adoption of animals to ensure that an animal will not be placed with a person with a record of animal abuse.   \n\t� 2.  Title 17 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new chapter 16 to read as follows:\nChapter 16\nAnimal Abuse Registration Act\n\n�17-1601 Definitions.\n�17-1602 Creation of an animal abuse registry.\n�17-1603 Animal abuse registration requirements.\n�17-1604 Prohibition on ownership of animals.\n�17-1605 Requirements of animal shelters.\n�17-1606 Rules and Regulations.\n�17-1607 Penalties.\n�17-1608 Applicability.\n\n      �17-1601 Definitions.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a person convicted of an animal abuse crime on or after the effective date of the local law that added this chapter who establishes residency in the city of New York following such person's release from incarceration or if such person was not incarcerated following such person's sentencing, must, within five days of establishing such residency, personally appear before the department at a location determined by the commissioner to register.\n      b.
