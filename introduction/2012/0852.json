For any car wash which has signed a bona fide collective bargaining agreement with a labor organization that is the lawful representative of the employees pursuant to the national labor relations act, the principal sum of the bond shall not be less than thirty thousand dollars.  \n      � 20-543 Payment of judgments. a. No license shall be issued or renewed pursuant to this subchapter, and every license already issued shall be subject to suspension or revocation, upon the failure of applicant or licensee to pay or satisfy any judgment secured against him or her or it, provided that such judgment was secured in a court of competent jurisdiction against the applicant or licensee for acts of commission or omission with regard to the business maintained, operated or conducted by him, her, or it pursuant to the license issued hereunder.\n      b. This requirement shall be applicable to any applicant or licensee who is a successor to any predecessor car wash which has failed to pay or satisfy any judgment secured against he, she, or it according to the terms listed in subdivision a of this section. An applicant shall be considered a successor if he, she, or it satisfies two or more of the following criteria: \n      1.

Shares in the ownership, management, control of the labor relations, or interrelations of business operations with the predecessor car wash;\n \t3.

Any license issued pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter may be suspended or revoked by the commissioner upon notice and hearing for any of the following causes:\n      1. Fraud, misrepresentation, or false statements contained in the application for the license;\n      2. Violation of any of the provisions of chapter one of this title, provided, however, that in the event of a conflict between the provisions of such chapter and the provisions of this subchapter, the provisions of this subchapter shall prevail;\n      3. Violation of any of the provisions of this subchapter;\n      4. Fraud, misrepresentation, or false statements made in the course of maintaining, operating, or conducting business pursuant to the license issued under the provisions of this subchapter; or\n      5. Failure to answer a summons or notice of violation, appear for a hearing, or pay a fine or civil penalty imposed pursuant to the operation of the car wash for which the license was issued. \n      c. Any individual or business entity operating a car wash without a valid license issued by the commissioner shall be liable for a civil penalty of two hundred dollars per day for every calendar day during which the unlicensed car wash operated, up to a maximum of fifteen thousand dollars.\n      d. Any applicant who knowingly or willingly submits false information to the commissioner as part of an application for license under section 20-541 of this subchapter shall be liable for a civil penalty of five thousand dollars in addition to any other civil or criminal penalties otherwise applicable under the law. \n      � 2.
