  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\tSection 1. Legislative findings and intent.  The Council finds that pregnant women are vulnerable to discrimination in the workplace in New York City.  For example, there are reports that women who request an accommodation that will allow them to maintain a healthy pregnancy, or who need a reasonable accommodation while recovering from childbirth, are being removed from their positions, placed on unpaid leave, or fired.  It is the intent of the Council to combat this form of discrimination by requiring employers to provide reasonable accommodations to pregnant women and those who suffer medical conditions related to pregnancy and childbirth.  Such a reasonable accommodation may include bathroom breaks, leave for a period of disability arising from childbirth, breaks to facilitate increased water intake, periodic rest for those who stand for long periods of time, and assistance with manual labor, among other things.  It is not the intent of the Council to require such accommodations if their provision would cause an undue hardship in the conduct of an employer’s business. \n\t§2. Subdivision 5 of section 8-102 of chapter one of title eight of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 14 for the year 2013, is amended to read as follows:\n\t5.

Legislative findings and intent.  The Council finds that pregnant women are vulnerable to discrimination in the workplace in New York City.  For example, there are reports that women who request an accommodation that will allow them to maintain a healthy pregnancy, or who need a reasonable accommodation while recovering from childbirth, are being removed from their positions, placed on unpaid leave, or fired.  It is the intent of the Council to combat this form of discrimination by requiring employers to provide reasonable accommodations to pregnant women and those who suffer medical conditions related to pregnancy and childbirth.  Such a reasonable accommodation may include bathroom breaks, leave for a period of disability arising from childbirth, breaks to facilitate increased water intake, periodic rest for those who stand for long periods of time, and assistance with manual labor, among other things.  It is not the intent of the Council to require such accommodations if their provision would cause an undue hardship in the conduct of an employer\\rquote s business. \\par\n\\tab\\'a72.
