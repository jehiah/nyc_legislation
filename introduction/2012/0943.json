Table 28-112.8 of chapter 1 of title 28 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 45 for the year 2011, is amended to read as follows:\nTable 28-112.8\nItem Description \tFee \tComments \t\nPlace of assembly certificate of operation. \t$200.\t$100 [renewal] amendment.\t\n\n§2.

The place of assembly certificate of operation shall contain the place of assembly certificate number, the number of persons who may legally occupy the space and any other information that the commissioner may determine. Such place of assembly certificate of operation shall be framed and mounted in a location that is conspicuously visible to a person entering the space. For the purposes of this article a department issued place of assembly permit [issued prior to the effective date of this code] or place of assembly certificate of operation shall be valid until its expiration, at which time a new place of assembly certificate of operation shall be required in accordance with the provisions of this article and with the filing requirements of the department. [Prior to the expiration of the term of such place of assembly permit, the party responsible for renewal shall apply to the department for a certificate of operation in accordance with this article, except that the issuance of such certificate shall be subject to the same inspection requirement as a renewal of a certificate of operation pursuant to this code.]\n§3.  Section 28-117.1 of chapter 1 of title 28 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding new sections 28-117.1.2 and 28-117.1.3 to read as follows:\n§28-117.1.2  New certificate required.  The following changes to a place of assembly shall require a new place of assembly certificate of operation instead of an amendment filed in accordance with  section 28-117.1.3:\n1.  For a department issued place of assembly permit or place of assembly certificate of operation that does not have a nine-digit job number, any change of zoning use group, assembly occupancy group A-1 through A-5, or any of the changes set forth in section 28-117.1.3.             \n2.  For all other department issued place of assembly permits or place of assembly certificates of operation, any change of zoning use group or assembly occupancy group A-1 through A-5.\n §28-117.1.3 Amendments.

Any amendment to the plan for seating and other moveable furnishings, in accordance with section 28-117.1.\n3.   Any change to the name of the establishment.\n§4.

A place of assembly certificate of operation shall be issued [for a term of 1 year and may be renewed annually upon payment of proper fees and proof of satisfactory inspection by the fire department] by the department and shall be effective for one year after its issuance.

Section 3110.7 of the New York city building code, as added by local law number 33 for the year 2007, is amended to read as follows:\n3110.7 Assembly seating.
