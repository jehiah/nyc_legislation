When setting its goals for such purchases, in addition to the factors set forth in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, each agency shall specifically consider the potential for such purchases to provide opportunities for MBEs, WBEs and EBEs to develop greater capacity, thereby increasing competition for city procurements.\t\n\t[(2)](3)\tAn agency utilization plan may be amended from time to time to reflect changes in the agency's projected expenditures or other relevant circumstances and resulting changes in such agency's participation goals. Such amendments shall be submitted to the commissioner, the city chief procurement officer and the speaker of the council at least thirty days prior to implementation. \n(4)   Prior to approving individual agency utilization plans, the commissioner, in consultation with the city chief procurement officer, shall consider whether such plans viewed  in the aggregate establish any goals exceeding the corresponding citywide goals set forth in subdivision d of this section.  If any aggregated goals are found to exceed the corresponding citywide goal,  the commissioner shall require agencies to adjust their goals so that plans, viewed in the aggregate, do not establish goals exceeding the citywide goals.  Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to limit the awards of contracts and subcontracts that may be made to MBEs, WBEs and EBEs without using goals.\n(5)\tThe commissioner, in consultation with the city chief procurement officer, shall, no later than July 31 of each year, publish on the division’s website a plan and schedule for each agency detailing the anticipated  contracting actions for the upcoming fiscal year that form the basis for the agency utilization plan of each such agency.  The plan and schedule shall include information specific to each prospective invitation for bids, request for proposal, or other solicitation, including, but not limited to, the specific type and scale of the services and/or goods to be procured, the term of the proposed contract, the method of solicitation the agency intends to utilize, and the anticipated fiscal year quarter of the planned solicitation.\nh.  Achieving agency participation goals. \n(1)  Each agency head shall be directly accountable for the goals set forth in his or her agency's utilization plan. \n(2)  Each agency shall make all reasonable efforts to meet the participation goals established in its agency utilization plan. Agencies shall, at a minimum, use the following methods to achieve participation goals: \n[(i)](a)  Agencies shall engage in outreach activities to encourage MBEs, WBEs and EBEs to compete for all facets of their procurement activities, including contracts awarded by negotiated acquisition, emergency and sole source contracts, and each agency shall seek to utilize MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs for all types of goods, services and construction they procure. \n[(ii)](b)  Agencies shall encourage eligible businesses to apply for certification as MBEs, WBEs and EBEs and inclusion in the directories of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs. Agencies shall also encourage MBEs, WBEs and EBEs to have their names included on their bidders lists, seek pre-qualification where applicable, and compete for city business as contractors and subcontractors. Agencies are encouraged to advertise procurement opportunities in general circulation media, trade and professional association publications and small business media, and publications of minority and women's business organizations, and send written notice of specific procurement opportunities to minority and women's business organizations. \n[(iii)](c)  All agency solicitations for bids or proposals shall include information referring potential bidders or proposers to the directories of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs prepared by the division.\n[(iv)](d)   In planning procurements, agencies shall consider the effect of the scope, specifications and size of a contract on opportunities for participation by MBEs, WBEs and EBEs. \n[(v) For construction contracts, agencies shall consider whether to enter into separate prime contracts for construction support services including, but not limited to, trucking, landscaping, demolition, site clearing, surveying and site security.] \n[(vi)](e)\tPrior to soliciting bids or proposals for contracts valued at over ten million dollars, other than contracts for capital projects valued at over twenty-five million dollars and contracts that are exempt pursuant to paragraph two of subdivision q of this section,  an agency shall submit the bid or proposal to the city chief procurement officer for a determination whether it is practicable to divide the proposed contract into smaller contracts and whether doing so will enhance competition for such contracts among MBEs, WBEs and EBEs and other potential bidders or proposers. If the city chief procurement officer determines that it is both practicable and advantageous in light of cost and other relevant factors to divide such contracts into smaller contracts, then he or she shall direct the agency to do so. \n[(vii)](f)\tAgencies shall examine their internal procurement policies, procedures and practices and, where practicable, address those elements, if any, that may negatively affect participation of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs in city procurement. \n [(viii) Agency M/WBE officers shall, in accordance with guidelines established by the city chief procurement officer, establish a process for quarterly meetings with MBEs, WBEs and EBEs to discuss what the agency looks for in evaluating bids and proposals.\n(ix) Agencies shall encourage prime contractors to enter joint venture agreements with MBEs, WBEs and EBEs.] \n\ti.\tParticipation goals for [construction and professional services] contracts for construction and professional and standard services. \n(1)  Prior to issuing the solicitation of bids or proposals for individual [construction and professional services] contracts, agencies shall establish [a target subcontracting percentage for the contract and] participation goals for MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs. [The \"target subcontracting percentage\" for the contract shall represent the percentage of the total contract which the agency anticipates a typical prime contractor in the relevant industry would in the normal course of business award to one or more subcontractors for amounts under one million dollars.  The participation goals established for a contract shall represent a percentage of the total dollar value of all subcontracts for amounts under one million dollars pursuant to the award]. Such goals may be greater than, less than or the same as the relevant citywide goal or goals established pursuant to subdivision d of this section. Taking into account the factors listed in this subdivision, an agency may establish a goal for a procurement that may be achieved by a combination of prime contract and subcontract dollars, a combination of construction and services performed pursuant to the contract, and/or a combination of MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs.  Alternatively, an agency may establish specific goals for particular types of services, and/or goals for particular types of certified firms.  In determining the participation goals for a particular contract, an agency shall consider the following factors: \n[(i)](a)  the scope of work; \n[(ii)](b)  the availability of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs able to perform the particular tasks required in the contract; \n[(iii)](c)  the extent to which the type and scale of work involved in the contract [presents] present prime contracting and subcontracting opportunities for amounts [under one million dollars] within the capacity of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs; \n[(iv)](d)   the agency's progress to date toward meeting its annual participation goals through race-neutral, gender-neutral and other means, and the agency's expectations as to the effect such methods will have on participation of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs in the agency's future contracts; and \n[(v)](e)\t\tany other factors the contracting agency deems relevant. \n(2)  A contracting agency shall not be required to establish participation goals for \n(i)  procurements described in subdivision q of this section; or\n(ii) when the agency has already attained the relevant goal in its annual utilization plan, or expects that it will attain such goal without the use of such participation goals.\n (3)  For each contract in which a contracting agency has established participation goals, such agency shall state in the solicitation for such contract that bidders and/or proposers shall be required to agree as a material term of the contract that[, with respect to the total amount of the contract to be awarded to one or more subcontractors pursuant to subcontracts for amounts under one million dollars,] the contractor shall [be subject to] meet the participation goals unless such goals are waived or modified by the agency in accordance with this section.   A contractor that is an MBE, WBE or EBE shall be permitted to count its own participation toward fulfillment of the relevant participation goal, provided that the value of such a contractor’s participation shall be determined by subtracting from the total value of the contract any amounts that the contractor pays to direct subcontractors.  A contractor that is a qualified joint venture shall be permitted to count a percentage of its own participation toward fulfillment of the relevant participation goal.  The value of such a contractor’s participation shall be determined by subtracting from the total value of the contract any amounts that the contractor pays to direct subcontractors, and then multiplying the remainder by the percentage to be applied to total profit to determine the amount to which an MBE, WBE or EBE is entitled pursuant to the joint venture agreement.  Notwithstanding any provision of this paragraph to the contrary, a contractor’s achievement of participation goals shall be determined as described in paragraph two of subdivision j of this section.\n(4)  For each contract in which participation goals are established, the agency shall include in its solicitation and/or bidding materials a referral to the directories prepared by the division pursuant to this section. \n(5)  For each contract for which participation goals are established, the contractor shall be required to submit with its bid or proposal[,] a contractor utilization plan indicating: \n(a)  whether the contractor is an MBE, WBE, EBE, or a qualified joint venture;  [the percentage of the work it intends to subcontract, and]\n(b)  the percentage of work it intends to award to direct subcontractors; [for amounts under one million dollars, and,] and\n\t(c)  in cases where the contractor intends to award direct subcontracts, [for amounts under one million dollars,] a description of the type and dollar value of work designated for participation by MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs, and the time frames in which such work is scheduled to begin and end. \n\tWhen the contractor utilization plan indicates that the bidder or proposer does not intend to [award the target subcontracting percentage] meet the participation goals, the bid or proposal shall not be deemed responsive unless the agency has granted a pre-award [waiver] request for change pursuant to paragraph 11 of this subdivision. \n(6)\t(a)  For each contract for which a contractor utilization plan has been submitted, the contracting agency shall require that within thirty days of the issuance of notice to proceed, and at least once per year thereafter, the contractor submit a list of persons to which it intends to award subcontracts within the next twelve months. In the event that a contracting agency disapproves a contractor's selection of a subcontractor or subcontractors, the contracting agency shall allow such contractor a reasonable time to propose alternate subcontractors. \n(b)  The contracting agency may also require the contractor to report periodically about the contracts awarded by its direct subcontractors to indirect subcontractors.\n(7)  For each contract for which a contractor utilization plan has been submitted, the contractor shall, with each voucher for payment, and/or periodically as the agency may require, submit statements, certified under penalty of perjury, which shall include, but not be limited to, the total amount the contractor paid to its direct subcontractors, and, where applicable pursuant to subparagraph (l) of paragraph (1) of subdivision j of this section, the total amount direct subcontractors paid to indirect subcontractors,  [(including subcontractors that are not MBEs, WBEs or EBEs)]; the names, addresses and contact numbers of each MBE, WBE or EBE hired as a subcontractor [pursuant to such plan] by the contractor or any of the contractor's direct subcontractors, as well as the dates and amounts paid to each MBE, WBE or EBE. The contractor shall also submit, along with its voucher for final payment, the total amount it paid to subcontractors, and, where applicable pursuant to subparagraph (l) of paragraph (1) of subdivision j of this section, the total amount its direct subcontractors paid directly to their indirect subcontractors [(including subcontractors that are not MBEs, WBEs or EBEs)]; and a final list, certified under penalty of perjury, which shall include the name, address and contact information of each subcontractor that is an MBE, WBE or EBE [hired pursuant to such plan], the work performed by, and the dates and amounts paid to each. \n(8)  If payments made to, or work performed by, MBEs, WBEs or EBEs are less than the amount specified in the contractor's utilization plan, the agency shall take appropriate action in accordance with subdivision o of this section, unless the contractor has obtained a modification of its utilization plan pursuant to paragraph 12 of this subdivision. \n(9)  When advertising a solicitation for bids or proposals for a contract for which a participation goal has been established, agencies shall include in the advertisement a general statement that the contract will be subject to participation goals for MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs. \n(10)  In the event that a contractor with a contract that includes a contractor utilization plan submits a request for a change order the value of which exceeds the greater of ten percent of such contract or $500,000, the agency shall [establish participation goals as if for a new contract for the work to be performed pursuant to such change order] review the scope of work for the contract, and the scale and types of work involved in the change order, and determine whether the participation goals should be modified.\n(11)  [Pre-award waiver]Requests from bidders or proposers for changes in participation goals. \n(a)  A bidder or proposer may request that an agency change the participation goal or goals established for the procurement on the grounds that goals are unreasonable in light of the availability of certified firms to perform the services required, or by demonstrating that it has legitimate business reasons for proposing a lower level of subcontracting in its utilization plan.\n(b)  If the contracting agency determines that the participation goals established for the procurement are unreasonable in light of the availability of certified firms to perform the services required, it shall revise the solicitation and extend the deadline for bids and proposals.\n\t[(i)](c)\tSubject to subparagraph ([(ii)]d) of this paragraph, the contracting agency may grant a full or partial waiver of the [target subcontracting percentage] participation goals to a bidder or proposer who demonstrates that it has legitimate business reasons for proposing the level of subcontracting in its utilization plan. The contracting agency shall make its determination in light of factors [which] that shall include, but not be limited to, whether the bidder or proposer has the capacity and the bona fide intention to perform the contract without any subcontracting, or to perform the contract without awarding the amount of subcontracts [for under one million dollars] represented by the [target subcontracting percentage] participation goals. In making such determination, the agency may consider whether the utilization plan is consistent with past subcontracting practices of the bidder or proposer, whether the bidder or proposer has made efforts to form a joint venture with a certified firm, and whether the bidder or proposer has made good faith efforts to identify portions of the contract that it intends to subcontract. [Within thirty days of the registration of a contract, the]The city chief contracting officer shall notify the council of any such waiver granted with respect to [the]a registered contract in the quarterly report required pursuant to subdivision l of this section. \t\n[(ii)](d)  The agency M/WBE officer shall provide written notice of requests for a full or partial waiver of the [target subcontracting percentage] participation goals to the division and the city chief procurement officer and shall not approve any such request without the approval of the city chief procurement officer, provided that the city chief procurement officer, upon adequate assurances of an agency's ability to administer its utilization plan in accordance with the provisions of this section, may determine that further approval from the city chief procurement officer is not required with respect to such requests for an agency's contracts or particular categories of an agency's contracts. The city chief procurement officer shall notify the speaker of the council in writing [within thirty days of]in the quarterly report required pursuant to subdivision l of this section following the registration of a contract for which a request for a full or partial waiver of a [target subcontracting percentage] participation goal was granted, provided that where an agency has been authorized to grant waivers without approval of the chief procurement officer, such notice shall be provided to the speaker of the council by the agency. Such notification shall include, but not be limited to, the name of the contractor, the original [target subcontracting percentage] participation goal, the waiver request, including all documentation, and an explanation for the approval of such request. \n(12)   Modification of utilization plans at contractor’s request or agency’s initiative. [(i)] (a)  A contractor may request modification of its utilization plan after the award of a contract. Subject to subparagraph [(ii)](b) of this paragraph, an agency may grant such request if it determines that such contractor has established, with appropriate documentary and other evidence, that it made all reasonable, good faith efforts to meet the goals set by the agency for the contract. In making such determination, the agency shall consider evidence of the following efforts, as applicable, along with any other relevant factors:  \n[(A)](i)  The contractor advertised opportunities to participate in the contract, where appropriate, in general circulation media, trade and professional association publications and small business media, and publications of minority and women's business organizations; \n     \t[(B)](ii)  The contractor provided notice of specific opportunities to participate in the contract, in a timely manner, to minority and women's business organizations; \n    \t [(C)](iii)\tThe contractor sent written notices, by certified mail or facsimile, in a timely manner, to advise MBEs, WBEs or EBEs that their interest in the contract was solicited; \n   \t [(D)](iv)\tThe contractor made efforts to identify portions of the work that could be substituted for portions originally designated for participation by MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs in the contractor utilization plan, and for which the contractor claims an inability to retain MBEs, WBEs or EBEs; \n     \t[(E)](v)\tThe contractor held meetings with MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs prior to the date their bids or proposals were due, for the purpose of explaining in detail the scope and requirements of the work for which their bids or proposals were solicited; \n \t   [(F)](vi)\tThe contractor made efforts to negotiate with MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs as relevant to perform specific subcontracts, or act as suppliers or service providers; \n    \t [(G](vii)\tTimely written requests for assistance made by the contractor to the agency M/WBE liaison officer and to the division; and\n     \t[(H)](viii)\tDescription of how recommendations made by the division and the contracting agency were acted upon and an explanation of why action upon such recommendations did not lead to the desired level of participation of MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs. \n \t [(ii)](b)  The agency M/WBE officer shall provide written notice of requests for such modifications to the division and the city chief procurement officer and shall not approve any such request for modification without the approval of the city chief procurement officer, provided that the city chief procurement officer, upon adequate assurances of an agency's ability to administer its utilization plan in accordance with the provisions of this section, may determine that further approval from the city chief procurement officer is not required with respect to such requests for an agency's contracts or particular categories of an agency's contracts. The city chief procurement officer, shall notify the speaker of the council in writing within seven days of the approval of a request for modification of a utilization plan, provided that where an agency has been authorized to grant modifications without approval of the chief procurement officer, such notice shall be provided to the speaker of the council by the agency. Such notification shall include, but not be limited to, the name of the contractor, the original utilization plan, the modification request, including all documentation, and an explanation for the approval of such request. \n  \t [(iii)](c)  An agency may modify the participation goals established for a procurement when the scope of the work has been changed by the agency in a manner that affects the scale and types of work that the contractor indicated in its contractor utilization plan would be awarded to subcontractors.  \n\t[(iv)](d)  The agency M/WBE officer shall provide written notice to the contractor of its determination that shall include the reasons for such determination. \n    \t(13)\t For each contract in which a contracting agency has established participation goals, the agency shall evaluate and assess the contractor's performance in meeting each such goal. Such evaluation and assessment shall be a part of the contractor's overall contract performance evaluation required pursuant to section 333 of the charter. \n\tj.\tDetermining credit for MBE, WBE and EBE participation. \n\t(1) \tAn agency's achievement of its annual goals shall be calculated as follows: \n    \t[(i)](a)\tThe [total] dollar amount that an agency has paid or is obligated to pay to a prime contractor that is an MBE, WBE or EBE, reduced by the dollar amount the contractor has paid or is obligated to pay its direct subcontractors upon their completion of work, [may] shall be credited toward the relevant goal.  Where an agency has paid or is obligated to pay a prime contractor that is both an MBE and a WBE, such amount shall be credited toward the relevant goal for MBEs or the goal for WBEs.  \n   \t[(ii)](b)  [The]Except as provided in subparagraph (c) of this paragraph, the total dollar amount that a prime contractor of an agency has paid or is obligated to pay to a direct subcontractor that is an MBE, WBE or EBE [may]shall be credited toward the relevant goal.  Where such a contractor has paid or is obligated to pay a direct subcontractor that is both an MBE and a WBE, such amount shall be credited toward the relevant goal for MBEs or the goal for WBEs. \n\t(c)  In the case of contracts of the types identified pursuant to subparagraph (l) of this paragraph, the total dollar amount that a prime contractor of an agency has paid or is obligated to pay a direct subcontractor that is an MBE, WBE, or EBE, reduced by the dollar amount the direct subcontractor has paid or is obligated to pay its indirect subcontractors upon completion of work, shall be credited toward the relevant goal.  Where such a contractor has paid or is obligated to pay a direct contractor that is both an MBE and a WBE, such amount shall be credited toward the relevant goal for MBEs or the goal for WBEs.\n(d)  In the case of contracts of the types identified pursuant to subparagraph (l) of this paragraph, the total dollar amount that a direct subcontractor of the prime contractor has paid or is obligated to pay to an indirect subcontractor that is an MBE, WBE or EBE shall be credited toward the relevant goal.  Where such a contractor has paid or is obligated to pay an indirect contractor that is both an MBE and a WBE, such amount shall be credited toward the relevant goal for MBEs or the goal for WBEs.\n   \t [(iii)](e)\tFor requirements contracts, credit [may] shall be given for the actual dollar amount paid under the contract. \n\t   [(iv)](f)\tWhere one or more MBEs, WBEs or EBEs is participating in a qualified joint venture, the amounts that the joint venture is required to pay its direct subcontractors shall be subtracted as provided in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph, and then a percentage of the remaining dollar amount of the contract equal to the percentage of total profit to which MBEs, WBEs or EBEs are entitled pursuant to the joint venture agreement shall be credited toward the relevant goal.  Where such a participant in a joint venture is both an MBE and a WBE, such amount shall be credited toward the relevant goal for MBEs or the goal for WBEs. \n    \t [(v)](g)\tNo credit shall be given for participation in a contract by an MBE, WBE or EBE that does not perform a commercially useful function. \n    \t[(vi)](h)\tNo credit shall be given for the participation in a contract by any company that has not been certified as an MBE, WBE or EBE in accordance with section 1304 of the charter. \n   \t [(vii)](i)\tIn the case of a contract for which the contractor is paid on a commission basis, the dollar amount of the contract may be determined on the basis of the commission earned or reasonably anticipated to be earned under the contract. \n     \t[(viii)](j)  No credit shall be given to a contractor for participation in a contract by a graduate MBE, WBE or EBE. \n     \t[(ix)](k)  The participation of a certified company shall not be credited toward more than one participation goal.\n(l)  The city chief procurement officer may identify types of contracts where payments to indirect subcontractors shall be credited toward the relevant participation goals.\n\t(2) \tA contractor's achievement of [each goal] its participation goals established in its utilization plan shall be calculated [in the same manner as described for calculating the achievement of agency utilization goals as described in paragraph (1) of this subdivision; provided that no] as follows: \n    \t[(i)](a)\tA contractor's use of direct subcontractors and their indirect subcontractors toward achievement of each goal established in its utilization plan shall be calculated in the same manner as described for calculating the achievement of agency utilization goals as described in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, except that a contractor’s use of a subcontractor that is both an MBE and a WBE shall not be credited toward the contractor’s achievement of more than one goal; \n   \t [(ii)](b)  A contractor that is an MBE, WBE or EBE shall be permitted to count its own participation toward fulfillment of the relevant participation goal, provided that the value of such a contractor’s participation shall be determined by subtracting from the total value of the contract any amounts that the contractor pays to direct subcontractors, and provided further that a contractor that is both an MBE and a WBE shall not be credited for its participation toward more than one goal; \n   \t [(iii)](c)  No credit shall be given to the contractor for the participation of a company that is not certified in accordance with section 1304 of the charter before the date that [the agency approves] the subcontractor completes the work under the subcontract. \n    \t[(iv)](d)  A contractor that is a qualified joint venture shall be permitted to count a percentage of its own participation toward fulfillment of the relevant participation goal.  The value of such a contractor’s participation shall be determined by subtracting from the total value of the contract any amounts that the contractor pays to direct subcontractors, and then multiplying the remainder by the percentage to be applied to total profit to determine the amount to which an MBE, WBE or EBE is entitled pursuant to the joint venture agreement; provided that where such a participant in a joint venture is both an MBE and a WBE, such amount shall not be credited toward more than one goal.\n\tk. \tSmall purchases. \n\t[(1) \tEach agency shall, consistent with the participation goals established in subdivision d of this section and such agency's utilization plan, establish goals for purchases valued at or below five thousand dollars which shall be made from MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs. \n    \t(2)]  Whenever an agency solicits bids or proposals for small purchases pursuant to section three hundred fourteen of the charter, the agency shall maintain records identifying the MBEs, WBEs and EBEs it solicited, which shall become part of the contract file. \n\tl. \tCompliance reporting. \n\t(1) \tThe city chief procurement officer, in consultation with the division, shall prepare and submit [semiannual]quarterly reports to the speaker of the council as described in this section.
