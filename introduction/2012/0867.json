  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\nSection 1. Title 24 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new chapter 10 to read as follows: \n\nChapter 10\n Environmental Hazard Remediation\n     \n      � 24-1000. Declaration of Policy.  It is hereby declared that asthma and other respiratory conditions have increased significantly in the United States and that evidence suggests that indoor environments, where most people spend a majority of their time, play an important role in predisposing vulnerable populations to asthma and other respiratory diseases. The National Academy of Sciences found that there was sufficient evidence to establish a causal link between a number of respiratory conditions and the presence of asthma triggers, irritants, pathogens, fungi and mold, including stachybotrys chartarum, soot from severe smoke or fire damage and flood damage, mold or environmental pathogens including bird or bat droppings or potentially infectious materials as defined by 29 CFR 1910, including H1N1, viruses, bacteria, blood borne pathogens, chemical spills, and sewage.  Vulnerable populations such as those with profound immune-suppression, obstructive or cavity lung diseases, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma exacerbated by moldy materials, pneumonitis, are at particular risk.

Declaration of Policy.  It is hereby declared that asthma and other respiratory conditions have increased significantly in the United States and that evidence suggests that indoor environments, where most people spend a majority of their time, play an important role in predisposing vulnerable populations to asthma and other respiratory diseases. The National Academy of Sciences found that there was sufficient evidence to establish a causal link between a number of respiratory conditions and the presence of asthma triggers, irritants, pathogens, fungi and mold, including stachybotrys chartarum, soot from severe smoke or fire damage and flood damage, mold or environmental pathogens including bird or bat droppings or potentially infectious materials as defined by 29 CFR 1910, including H1N1, viruses, bacteria, blood borne pathogens, chemical spills, and sewage.  Vulnerable populations such as those with profound immune-suppression, obstructive or cavity lung diseases, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma exacerbated by moldy materials, pneumonitis, are at particular risk.  A highly trained workforce with skills across individual hazard and remediation method techniques will help to address multiple and common hazards in a safe manner.
