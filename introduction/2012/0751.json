  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\nSection 1.   Legislative findings and intent.   The Child Fatality Review Advisory Team, created by Local Law 115 of 2005, conducts a comprehensive, multiagency and multidisciplinary review of all child deaths in New York City.  Their work highlights trends and patterns regarding how and why children die in New York City, and helps the City create policies and take actions to prevent other such deaths and improve the health and safety of New York City’s children.  Local Law 115, by its own terms, was deemed repealed on January 30, 2012.\nThe Council finds that this review must occur at the City level to ensure that the characteristics of child protection that are unique to a large urban area such as New York City are appropriately identified and addressed.  The Child Fatality Review Advisory Team promotes cooperation and communication among the various City agencies involved in investigating child fatalities and facilitates the provision of services needed by children and families.  Therefore, the Council finds that making permanent the New York City Child Fatality Review Advisory Team is necessary to identify preventable social and family circumstances that contribute to child fatalities; provide recommendations regarding the investigation and prevention of child deaths; and identify problems in practices and recommend solutions.\n§2.   Section 4 of local law no. 115 for the year 2005 is amended to read as follows:\n§4.  This local law shall take effect ninety days after its enactment into law [and shall be deemed repealed on January 30, 2012].  \n§3.  This local law shall take effect immediately and shall be deemed to have been in full force and effect on and after January 30, 2012.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLCC \nLS 3225\n1/24/12",

Legislative findings and intent.   The Child Fatality Review Advisory Team, created by Local Law 115 of 2005, conducts a comprehensive, multiagency and multidisciplinary review of all child deaths in New York City.  Their work highlights trends and patterns regarding how and why children die in New York City, and helps the City create policies and take actions to prevent other such deaths and improve the health and safety of New York City\\rquote s children.  Local Law 115, by its own terms, was deemed repealed on January 30, 2012.\\par\n\\pard\\ltrpar\\nowidctlpar\\fi720\\sl480\\slmult1 The Council finds that this review must occur at the City level to ensure that the characteristics of child protection that are unique to a large urban area such as New York City are appropriately identified and addressed.  The Child Fatality Review Advisory Team promotes cooperation and communication among the various City agencies involved in investigating child fatalities and facilitates the provision of services needed by children and families.  Therefore, the Council finds that making permanent the New York City Child Fatality Review Advisory Team is necessary to identify preventable social and family circumstances that contribute to child fatalities; provide recommendations regarding the investigation and prevention of child deaths; and identify problems in practices and recommend solutions.\\par\n\\pard\\ltrpar\\nowidctlpar\\fi720\\sa120\\sl480\\slmult1\\'a72.   \\cf1 Section 4 of local law no. 115 for the year 2005\\cf0  is amended to read as follows:\\par\n\\'a74.
