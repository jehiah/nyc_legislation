  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\nSection 1. Legislative findings and intent. The Council finds that it is important to the general welfare and economic vitality of the City to have a robust residential and commercial recycling program. Unfortunately, there has been an increase in the theft of recyclable material placed curbside for collection by the Department of Sanitation (DSNY) or private carters by persons utilizing motor vehicles. Additionally, the City does not receive recyclables from certain large residential and institutional buildings. Such activity has a negative economic impact on the City, jeopardizes the stability and integrity of the City’s residential and commercial recycling program and makes it more difficult to achieve the City’s recycling goals. Furthermore, there has been a dramatic increase in the theft of recyclable material containing refrigerants placed curbside by residents for DSNY removal. Theft of this material likely means that the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other refrigerants present in this material are not being properly removed pursuant to the Clean Air Act. To address these issues, the Council finds that it is necessary to strengthen the laws against the unlawful removal of recyclable material and bolster DSNY’s collection from residential and institutional buildings.\n§ 2.  Subdivision 7 of section 16-118 of the administrative code of the city of New York is REPEALED and reenacted to read as follows:\n7. No person shall prevent, or otherwise interfere with, the sweeping or cleaning of any street, the removal of snow or ice from any street or the collection or removal of any solid waste or recyclable material from any street, by any employee of the department.\n§ 3.  Subdivisions 8 and 9 of section 16-118 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 50 for the year 2007, are amended to read as follows:\n8.

[Except for any violation of subparagraph one of paragraph b or paragraph c of subdivision seven of this section by a person using or operating a motor vehicle, or any violation of subparagraph two of paragraph b of subdivision seven of this section, or any violation of paragraph d of subdivision seven of this section, any] Any person violating the provisions of this section shall be liable for a civil penalty of not less than fifty dollars nor more than two hundred fifty dollars, except that for a second violation of subdivision one, three, four, or six of this section within any twelve-month period, such person shall be liable for a civil penalty of not less than two hundred fifty dollars nor more than three hundred fifty dollars and for a third or subsequent violation of subdivision one, three, four or six of this section within any twelve-month period such person shall be liable for a civil penalty of not less than three hundred fifty dollars nor more than four hundred fifty dollars.\n§ 4.

Where a notice of violation or summons is issued for a violation of section 16-461 of this chapter based upon a sworn statement by one or more individuals and where the commissioner determines, in the exercise of his or her discretion, that such sworn statement, either alone or in conjunction with the testimony of the person submitting such sworn statement at a civil or criminal proceeding or in a proceeding before the environmental control board, contributes to  the imposition of a civil or criminal penalty upon any person for a violation of section 16-461 of this chapter, the commissioner shall offer as a reward to such individual or individuals an amount that, in the aggregate, is equal to fifty percent of any civil or criminal penalty collected.  No peace officer, employee of the department or of the environmental control board, employee of any company under contract with the department, or employee of any governmental entity that, in conjunction with the department, conducts enforcement activity relating to a violation of section 16-461 of this chapter, shall be entitled to obtain the benefit of any such reward when acting in the discharge of his or her official duties.\n§ 16-463 Receipt of recyclable material. a. 1.

There shall be a rebuttable presumption that all recyclable material received for storage, collection or processing was generated within the city of New York. This subdivision shall not apply to a redemption center, dealer or distributor as defined in section 27-1003 of the environmental conservation law, or to any person who, using a motor vehicle, collects recyclable containers in bulk and is required to be registered pursuant to local law.\nc. No person shall receive for storage, collection or processing any department-marked item from any person other than an authorized employee or agent of the department.

Legislative findings and intent. The Council finds that it is important to the general welfare and economic vitality of the City to have a robust residential and commercial recycling program. Unfortunately, there has been an increase in the theft of recyclable material placed curbside for collection by the Department of Sanitation (DSNY) or private carters by persons utilizing motor vehicles. Additionally, the City does not receive recyclables from certain large residential and institutional buildings. Such activity has a negative economic impact on the City, jeopardizes the stability and integrity of the City\\rquote s residential and commercial recycling program and makes it more difficult to achieve the City\\rquote s recycling goals. Furthermore, there has been a dramatic increase in the theft of \\cf1 recyclable material containing refrigerants\\cf0  placed curbside by residents for DSNY removal. Theft of this material likely means that the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other refrigerants present in this material are not being properly removed pursuant to the Clean Air Act. To address these issues, the Council finds that it is necessary to strengthen the laws against the unlawful removal of recyclable material and bolster DSNY\\rquote s collection from residential and institutional buildings.\\par\n\\'a7 2.
