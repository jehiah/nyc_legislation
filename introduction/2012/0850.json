Chapter 3 of title 25 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 25-323 to read as follows:\n\t§  25-323   Timelines. a.  The commission shall determine the eligibility of a request for evaluation that has been accepted for further study within an eight month period for individual landmarks, including interior landmarks,  and within eighteen months for historic districts and scenic landmarks.  The commission or an authorized committee of the commission can, by affirmative vote, extend the study period by four months for an individual landmark and six months for a historic district.\n\tb. The commission shall have six months from the postmarked date of mailing of notice by registered mail to an owner to calendar a hearing to designate a landmark, whether an individual landmark or historic district.  After calendaring an application, the commission shall have two months to hold a hearing. If more than one hearing is required, the commission or an authorized committee of the commission may, by affirmative vote, extend the consideration period for three months.\n\tc. If no action is taken within the timeline prescribed in subdivision b of this section, the department of buildings shall act  on all permit applications for properties that are indicated within a landmark application.\n\n\td. For all applications that are undecided on the effective date of the local law that added this section and that have had a two year lapse between an initial public hearing and final action being taken, the commission must take final action on the request for evaluation by July 1, 2013, if a request is made in writing by the owner of the property in question.  \n§2.
