No request for proposal for new client services program contracts shall be released to the public unless at least 45 days prior to such release a concept report regarding such request for proposal is released to the public. Prior to the release of concept reports, the city shall publish a notification of the release in  five consecutive editions of the city record and electronically on the city's website in a location that is accessible to the public, and upon release, concept reports shall be posted on  the  city's  website  in a location  that  is  accessible by the  public.  For purposes of this subdivision, the term, \"new client services program\" shall mean any program that differs substantially in scope from an agency's current contractual client services programs, including, but not limited to, substantial  differences in the number or types of clients, geographic areas, evaluation criteria, service design or price maximums or ranges per participant if applicable.  For purposes of this subdivision, the term, \"concept report\", shall mean a document outlining the basic requirements of a request for proposal for client services contracts and shall include, but not be limited to, statements explaining:\n(i) the purpose of the request for proposal; \n(ii) the planned method of evaluating proposals, including the extent to which criteria such as job history, experience providing like services in the proposed geographic area(s), and cultural competency will factor into an evaluation; \n(iii) the proposed term of the contract;\n(iv)  the procurement timeline, including, but not limited to, the expected start date for new contracts, expected request for proposal release date,  approximate proposal submission deadline and expected award announcement date;\n(v) funding information, including but not limited to, total funding available for the request for proposal and sources of funding, anticipated number of contracts to be awarded, average funding level of contracts, anticipated funding  minimums, maximums or ranges per participant, if applicable, and funding match requirements; \n(vi)  program information, including, but not limited to, as applicable, proposed  model or program parameters, site, service hours, participant population(s) to be served and participant minimums and/or maximums; [and]\n(vii)  the scope of existing services provided and a detailed description comparing the proposed services with such existing services, including but not limited to the ways in which the proposed services expand, reduce, supplement, or replace existing services; \n(viii)  the method used to determine the need for the level of proposed services, how such method was selected, and, to the extent that alternative methods exist, why such method is more advantageous than such alternatives; and\n [(vii)](ix) proposed vendor performance reporting requirements.\nb.  Notwithstanding  the  issuance of a concept report, the agency may change the above-required information at any time after the issuance of such concept report.  Non-compliance with this section shall not be grounds to invalidate a contract.\n§2.  This local law shall take effect ninety days after its enactment.\n\nSKM\nLS #3704\n10/14/12",
