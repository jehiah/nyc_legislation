Any  such  mayoral  disapproval  shall  be  filed  by the mayor with the  council and shall be subject to override by a  two-thirds  vote  of  the  council  within  ten days of such filing. If such proposed rescission is  approved or modified by the council,  such  rescission  or  modification  thereof  shall  not  take  effect  until the time for disapproval by the  mayor has expired; provided, however, that if the mayor disapproves such  rescission or modification, it shall not take effect unless the  council  overrides  the  mayor's  disapproval.
