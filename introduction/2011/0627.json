Subchapter 3 of chapter 1 of title 19 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 19-187 to read as follows: \n§19-187 Master plan for bicycle lanes. a. For purposes of this section, the following terms shall have the following meanings:\n1. “bicycle lane” shall mean a marked lane in the roadbed for the exclusive use of bicyclists;\n2. “protected bicycle lane” shall mean a bicycle lane that is separated from moving motor vehicle traffic by a parking lane, physical boundary or distance in excess of five feet for all or part of the length of such bicycle lane.\nb. The commissioner shall draft and submit a plan for bicycle lanes to be installed on roads under the jurisdiction of the commissioner.  Such plan shall indicate the proposed locations of future bicycle lanes, and any changes to existing bicycle lanes.  The plan shall indicate, to the extent practicable, whether such bicycle lanes would be protected bicycle lanes.  The plan shall also indicate, to the extent practicable, where such bicycle lanes are anticipated to require the elimination of a motor vehicle travel lane and/or the loss of parking.  Not less than thirty days prior to the finalization of such plan, the commissioner shall consult with the police department, the fire department, the department of small business service, the mayor’s office for persons with disabilities, community boards, borough presidents and council members.\nc. The first plan submitted pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be presented to the council, to all borough presidents and to all community boards via electronic mail no later than June 30, 2012.  Thereafter, an updated plan shall be sent to the council, all borough presidents and to all community boards via electronic mail not later than June 30, 2017 and on or before June 30 every five years thereafter.\n§2.
