  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\nSection 1.  Subdivision a of section 17-345 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\na.  Registration. 1.  The commissioner [may] shall order the owner of a dangerous dog to register such dog with the department. The application for such registration shall contain the name and address of the owner, the breed, age, sex, color, and any other identifying marks of the dog, the location where the dog is to be kept if not at the address of the owner and any other information which the commissioner may require. The application for registration pursuant to this paragraph shall be accompanied by a registration fee of twenty-five dollars. Each dog registered pursuant hereto shall be assigned an official registration number by the department. Such registration number shall be inscribed on a metal tag which shall be attached to the dog's collar at all times. The tag and a certificate of registration shall be of such form and design and shall contain such information as the commissioner shall prescribe and shall be issued to the owner upon payment of the registration fee and the presentment of sufficient evidence that the owner has complied with all of the orders of the commissioner as prescribed at the determination hearing. \n2.  In addition, such registry shall be posted on the department’s website and made available, at no cost, to a member of the public upon request. Such registry shall contain information about any dangerous dog registered pursuant to this section, including but not limited to, the name and address of the owner, the name, breed, age, sex, color, and any other identifying marks of the dog, the location where the dog is kept if not at the address of the owner, the incident which led to the dangerous dog designation and any other information which the commissioner may require. Failure of an owner to comply with a commissioner’s order to register a dangerous dog pursuant to this section may result in confiscation and/or confinement of such dog under section 17-346 of this code.\n§2.  This local law shall take effect ninety days after enactment; provided, however, that the commissioner shall take such actions, including the promulgation of rules, as are necessary for timely implementation of this local law. \n\nLS# 2573\nLCC/JM/IR\n6/28/11",
