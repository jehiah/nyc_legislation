It shall be unlawful for any dealer, as defined in section four hundred fifteen of the vehicle and traffic law, to park, store, or otherwise maintain on any street a motor vehicle that is in the dealer's possession while awaiting repair or subsequent return to the owner or lessee of such motor vehicle.  Any dealer in possession of a motor vehicle awaiting repair or subsequent return to the owner or lessee of such motor vehicle shall, at all times, display a placard, clearly legible through the motor vehicle's forward windshield, indicating the name, address, license number and telephone contact information of such dealer. \n      c.

The penalties and fees provided for in this section shall be in addition to any other penalties, fees or remedies provided by law or regulation.\nยง2.
