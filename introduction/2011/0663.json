The notice of violation shall be served personally upon the operator of a motor vehicle who is present at the time of service, and his or her name, together with the license designation as shown by the registration plates on said vehicle or, if there is no such plate, the vehicle information number (VIN), shall be inserted therein. The notice of violation shall be served upon the owner of the motor vehicle if the operator is not present, by affixing such notice to said vehicle in a conspicuous place. Whenever such notice is so affixed, in lieu of inserting the name of the person charged with the violation in the space provided for the identification of said person, the words \"owner of the motor vehicle bearing license\" may be inserted to be followed by the license designation as shown by the registration plates or, if there is no such plate, the vehicle information number on said vehicle. Service of the notice of violation by affixation as herein provided shall have the same force and effect and shall be subject to the same penalties for disregard thereof as though the same was personally served with the name of the person charged with the violation inserted therein.\nÂ§ 2.
