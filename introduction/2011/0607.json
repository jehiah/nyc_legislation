All solicitations for contracts for which utilization plans are to be established shall include notice of potential audit. \n(11) The division shall assist agencies in identifying and seeking ways to reduce or eliminate practices such as bonding requirements or delays in payment by prime contractors that may present barriers to competition by MBEs, WBEs, and EBEs.\nf. Responsibilities of agency M/WBE officers. Each agency head shall designate a deputy commissioner or other executive officer to act as the agency M/WBE officer who shall be directly accountable to the agency head concerning the activities of the agency in carrying out its responsibilities pursuant to this section. The duties of the M/WBE officer shall include, but not be limited to: \n(i) creating the agency's utilization plan in accordance with subdivision g of this section; \n(ii) acting as the agency's liaison with the division; \n(iii) acting as a liaison with organizations and/or associations of MBEs, WBEs, and EBEs, informing such organizations and/or associations of the agency's procurement procedures, and advising them of future procurement opportunities; \n(iv) ensuring that agency bid solicitations and requests for proposals are sent to MBEs, WBEs, and EBEs in a timely manner, consistent with this section and rules of the procurement policy board; \n(v) referring MBEs, WBEs, and EBEs to technical assistance services available from agencies and other organizations; \n(vi) reviewing requests for waivers of target subcontracting percentages and/or modifications of participation goals and contractor utilization plans in accordance with paragraphs 11 and/or 12 of subdivision i of this section; \n(vii) working with the division, [and] city chief procurement officer, and the director in creating directories as required pursuant to subdivision k of this section. In fulfilling this duty, the agency M/WBE officer shall track and record each contractor that is an MBE, WBE or EBE and each subcontractor hired pursuant to such officer's agency contracts that is an MBE, WBE or EBE, and shall share such information with the commissioner, [and] the city chief procurement officer, and the director; \n(viii) for contracts for which utilization goals have been established pursuant to subdivision i of this section, monitoring each contractor's compliance with its utilization plan by appropriate means, which shall include, but need not be limited to, job site inspections, contacting MBEs, WBEs and EBEs identified in the plan to confirm their participation, and auditing the contractor's books and records; \n(ix) monitoring the agency's procurement activities to ensure compliance with its agency utilization plan and progress towards the participation goals as established in such plan; and \n(x) providing to the city chief procurement officer and the director information for the reports required in subdivision l of this section and providing any other plans and/or reports required pursuant to this section or requested by the city chief procurement officer and/or the director. \ng. Agency utilization plans. (1) Beginning May 15, 2006, and on April 1 of each year thereafter, each agency which has made procurements in excess of five million dollars during the fiscal year which ended on June 30 of the preceding calendar year shall submit an agency utilization plan for the fiscal year commencing in July of the year when such plan is to be submitted to the commissioner. Upon approval by the commissioner such plan shall be submitted to the speaker of the council. Each such plan shall, at a minimum, include the following: \n(i) the agency's participation goals for MBEs, WBEs and EBEs for the year; \n(ii) an explanation for any agency goal that is different than the participation goal for the relevant group and industry classification as determined pursuant to subdivision d of this section; \n(iii) a list of the names and titles of agency personnel responsible for implementation of the agency utilization plan; \n(iv) methods and relevant activities proposed for achieving the agency's participation goals; and \n(v) any other information which the agency or the commissioner deems relevant or necessary. \n(2) An agency utilization plan may be amended from time to time to reflect changes in the agency's projected expenditures or other relevant circumstances and resulting changes in such agency's participation goals. Such amendments shall be submitted to the commissioner, the city chief procurement officer, the director, and the speaker of the council at least thirty days prior to implementation. \nh. Achieving agency participation goals. (1) Each agency head shall be directly accountable for the goals set forth in his or her agency's utilization plan. \n(2) Each agency shall make all reasonable efforts to meet the participation goals established in its agency utilization plan. Agencies shall, at a minimum, use the following methods to achieve participation goals: \n(i) Agencies shall engage in outreach activities to encourage MBEs, WBEs and EBEs to compete for all facets of their procurement activities, including contracts awarded by negotiated acquisition, emergency and sole source contracts, and each agency shall seek to utilize MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs for all types of goods, services and construction they procure. \n(ii) Agencies shall encourage eligible businesses to apply for certification as MBEs, WBEs and EBEs and inclusion in the directories of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs. Agencies shall also encourage MBEs, WBEs and EBEs to have their names included on their bidders lists, seek pre-qualification where applicable, and compete for city business as contractors and subcontractors. Agencies are encouraged to advertise procurement opportunities in general circulation media, trade and professional association publications and small business media, and publications of minority and women's business organizations, and send written notice of specific procurement opportunities to minority and women's business organizations. \n(iii) All agency solicitations for bids or proposals shall include information referring potential bidders or proposers to the directories of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs prepared by the division. \n(iv) In planning procurements, agencies shall consider the effect of the scope, specifications and size of a contract on opportunities for participation by MBEs, WBEs and EBEs. \n(v) For construction contracts, agencies shall consider whether to enter into separate prime contracts for construction support services including, but not limited to, trucking, landscaping, demolition, site clearing, surveying and site security. \n(vi) Prior to soliciting bids or proposals for contracts valued at over ten million dollars, an agency shall submit the bid or proposal to the city chief procurement officer and the director for a determination whether it is practicable to divide the proposed contract into smaller contracts and whether doing so will enhance competition for such contracts among MBEs, WBEs and EBEs and other potential bidders or proposers. Upon consultation with the director, [I]if the city chief procurement officer determines that it is both practicable and advantageous in light of cost and other relevant factors to divide such contracts into smaller contracts, then he or she shall direct the agency to do so. \n(vii) Agencies shall examine their internal procurement policies, procedures and practices and, where practicable, address those elements, if any, that may negatively affect participation of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs in city procurement. \n(viii) Agency M/WBE officers shall, in accordance with guidelines established by the city chief procurement officer, establish a process for quarterly meetings with MBEs, WBEs and EBEs to discuss what the agency looks for in evaluating bids and proposals. \n(ix) Agencies shall encourage prime contractors to enter joint venture agreements with MBEs, WBEs and EBEs. \ni. Participation goals for construction and professional services contracts. (1) Prior to issuing the solicitation of bids or proposals for individual construction and professional services contracts, agencies shall establish a target subcontracting percentage for the contract and participation goals for MBEs, WBEs and EBEs. The “target subcontracting percentage” for the contract shall represent the percentage of the total contract which the agency anticipates a typical prime contractor in the relevant industry would in the normal course of business award to one or more subcontractors for amounts under one million dollars. The participation goals established for a contract shall represent a percentage of the total dollar value of all subcontracts for amounts under one million dollars pursuant to the award. Such goals may be greater than, less than or the same as the relevant citywide goal or goals established pursuant to subdivision d of this section. In determining the participation goals for a particular contract, an agency shall consider the following factors: \n(i) the scope of work; \n(ii) the availability of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs able to perform the particular tasks required in the contract; \n(iii) the extent to which the type of work involved in the contract presents subcontracting opportunities for amounts under one million dollars; \n(iv) the agency's progress to date toward meeting its annual participation goals through race-neutral, gender-neutral and other means, and the agency's expectations as to the effect such methods will have on participation of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs in the agency's future contracts; and \n(v) any other factors the contracting agency deems relevant. \n(2) A contracting agency shall not be required to establish participation goals (i) for procurements described in subdivision q of this section; or \n(ii) when the agency has already attained the relevant goal in its annual utilization plan, or expects that it will attain such goal without the use of such participation goals. \n(3) For each contract in which a contracting agency has established participation goals, such agency shall state in the solicitation for such contract that bidders and/or proposers shall be required to agree as a material term of the contract that, with respect to the total amount of the contract to be awarded to one or more subcontractors pursuant to subcontracts for amounts under one million dollars, the contractor shall be subject to participation goals unless such goals are modified by the agency in accordance with this section. \n(4) For each contract in which participation goals are established, the agency shall include in its solicitation and/or bidding materials, a referral to the directories prepared by the division pursuant to this section. \n(5) For each contract for which participation goals are established the contractor shall be required to submit with its bid or proposal, a utilization plan indicating the percentage of the work it intends to subcontract, and the percentage of work it intends to award to subcontractors for amounts under one million dollars, and, in cases where the contractor intends to award subcontracts for amounts under one million dollars, a description of the type and dollar value of work designated for participation by MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs, and the time frames in which such work is scheduled to begin and end.

Agencies shall seek to ensure substantial progress toward the attainment of each of these goals in as short a time as practicable. \\par\n(3) The citywide goals shall not be summarily adopted as goals for individual procurements; rather, as set forth in subdivision i of this section, goals for such procurements may be set at levels higher, lower, or the same as the citywide goals. \\par\n(4)(A) Beginning twelve months after the effective date of the local law that added this section and every two years thereafter, the commissioner, in consultation with the city chief procurement officer \\ul and the director\\ulnone , shall, for each industry classification and each minority group, review and compare the availability rates of firms owned by minorities and women to the utilization rates of such firms in agency contracts and subcontracts, and shall on the basis of such review and any other relevant information, where appropriate, revise by rule the citywide participation goals set forth in this subdivision. In making such revision, the commissioner shall consider the extent to which discrimination continues to have an impact on the ability of minorities and women to compete for city contracts and subcontracts. The commissioner shall submit the results of such review and any proposed revisions to the participation goals to the speaker of the council at least sixty days prior to publishing a proposed rule that would revise participation goals. \\par\n(B) Beginning twelve months after the effective date of the local law that added this section and every two years thereafter, the commissioner shall review information collected by the department to determine the availability and utilization of EBEs, and shall, \\ul in consultation with the city chief procurement officer and the director\\ulnone , on the basis of such review and any other relevant information, where appropriate, revise by rule the citywide participation goals set forth in this subdivision.

Responsibilities of agency M/WBE officers. Each agency head shall designate a deputy commissioner or other executive officer to act as the agency M/WBE officer who shall be directly accountable to the agency head concerning the activities of the agency in carrying out its responsibilities pursuant to this section.

Agency utilization plans. (1) Beginning May 15, 2006, and on April 1 of each year thereafter, each agency which has made procurements in excess of five million dollars during the fiscal year which ended on June 30 of the preceding calendar year shall submit an agency utilization plan for the fiscal year commencing in July of the year when such plan is to be submitted to the commissioner. Upon approval by the commissioner such plan shall be submitted to the speaker of the council. Each such plan shall, at a minimum, include the following: \\par\n(i) the agency's participation goals for MBEs, WBEs and EBEs for the year; \\par\n(ii) an explanation for any agency goal that is different than the participation goal for the relevant group and industry classification as determined pursuant to subdivision d of this section; \\par\n(iii) a list of the names and titles of agency personnel responsible for implementation of the agency utilization plan; \\par\n(iv) methods and relevant activities proposed for achieving the agency's participation goals; and \\par\n(v) any other information which the agency or the commissioner deems relevant or necessary. \\par\n(2) An agency utilization plan may be amended from time to time to reflect changes in the agency's projected expenditures or other relevant circumstances and resulting changes in such agency's participation goals. Such amendments shall be submitted to the commissioner, the city chief procurement officer\\ul , the director,\\ulnone  and the speaker of the council at least thirty days prior to implementation. \\par\nh. Achieving agency participation goals. (1) Each agency head shall be directly accountable for the goals set forth in his or her agency's utilization plan. \\par\n(2) Each agency shall make all reasonable efforts to meet the participation goals established in its agency utilization plan. Agencies shall, at a minimum, use the following methods to achieve participation goals: \\par\n(i) Agencies shall engage in outreach activities to encourage MBEs, WBEs and EBEs to compete for all facets of their procurement activities, including contracts awarded by negotiated acquisition, emergency and sole source contracts, and each agency shall seek to utilize MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs for all types of goods, services and construction they procure. \\par\n(ii) Agencies shall encourage eligible businesses to apply for certification as MBEs, WBEs and EBEs and inclusion in the directories of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs. Agencies shall also encourage MBEs, WBEs and EBEs to have their names included on their bidders lists, seek pre-qualification where applicable, and compete for city business as contractors and subcontractors. Agencies are encouraged to advertise procurement opportunities in general circulation media, trade and professional association publications and small business media, and publications of minority and women's business organizations, and send written notice of specific procurement opportunities to minority and women's business organizations. \\par\n(iii) All agency solicitations for bids or proposals shall include information referring potential bidders or proposers to the directories of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs prepared by the division. \\par\n(iv) In planning procurements, agencies shall consider the effect of the scope, specifications and size of a contract on opportunities for participation by MBEs, WBEs and EBEs. \\par\n(v) For construction contracts, agencies shall consider whether to enter into separate prime contracts for construction support services including, but not limited to, trucking, landscaping, demolition, site clearing, surveying and site security. \\par\n(vi) Prior to soliciting bids or proposals for contracts valued at over ten million dollars, an agency shall submit the bid or proposal to the city chief procurement officer \\ul and the director\\ulnone  for a determination whether it is practicable to divide the proposed contract into smaller contracts and whether doing so will enhance competition for such contracts among MBEs, WBEs and EBEs and other potential bidders or proposers. \\ul Upon consultation with the director, \\ulnone [I]\\ul i\\ulnone f the city chief procurement officer determines that it is both practicable and advantageous in light of cost and other relevant factors to divide such contracts into smaller contracts, then he or she shall direct the agency to do so. \\par\n(vii) Agencies shall examine their internal procurement policies, procedures and practices and, where practicable, address those elements, if any, that may negatively affect participation of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs in city procurement. \\par\n(viii) Agency M/WBE officers shall, in accordance with guidelines established by the city chief procurement officer, establish a process for quarterly meetings with MBEs, WBEs and EBEs to discuss what the agency looks for in evaluating bids and proposals. \\par\n(ix) Agencies shall encourage prime contractors to enter joint venture agreements with MBEs, WBEs and EBEs. \\par\ni. Participation goals for construction and professional services contracts. (1) Prior to issuing the solicitation of bids or proposals for individual construction and professional services contracts, agencies shall establish a target subcontracting percentage for the contract and participation goals for MBEs, WBEs and EBEs. The \\ldblquote target subcontracting percentage\\rdblquote  for the contract shall represent the percentage of the total contract which the agency anticipates a typical prime contractor in the relevant industry would in the normal course of business award to one or more subcontractors for amounts under one million dollars. The participation goals established for a contract shall represent a percentage of the total dollar value of all subcontracts for amounts under one million dollars pursuant to the award. Such goals may be greater than, less than or the same as the relevant citywide goal or goals established pursuant to subdivision d of this section. In determining the participation goals for a particular contract, an agency shall consider the following factors: \\par\n(i) the scope of work; \\par\n(ii) the availability of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs able to perform the particular tasks required in the contract; \\par\n(iii) the extent to which the type of work involved in the contract presents subcontracting opportunities for amounts under one million dollars; \\par\n(iv) the agency's progress to date toward meeting its annual participation goals through race-neutral, gender-neutral and other means, and the agency's expectations as to the effect such methods will have on participation of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs in the agency's future contracts; and \\par\n(v) any other factors the contracting agency deems relevant. \\par\n(2) A contracting agency shall not be required to establish participation goals (i) for procurements described in subdivision q of this section; or \\par\n(ii) when the agency has already attained the relevant goal in its annual utilization plan, or expects that it will attain such goal without the use of such participation goals. \\par\n(3) For each contract in which a contracting agency has established participation goals, such agency shall state in the solicitation for such contract that bidders and/or proposers shall be required to agree as a material term of the contract that, with respect to the total amount of the contract to be awarded to one or more subcontractors pursuant to subcontracts for amounts under one million dollars, the contractor shall be subject to participation goals unless such goals are modified by the agency in accordance with this section. \\par\n(4) For each contract in which participation goals are established, the agency shall include in its solicitation and/or bidding materials, a referral to the directories prepared by the division pursuant to this section. \\par\n(5) For each contract for which participation goals are established the contractor shall be required to submit with its bid or proposal, a utilization plan indicating the percentage of the work it intends to subcontract, and the percentage of work it intends to award to subcontractors for amounts under one million dollars, and, in cases where the contractor intends to award subcontracts for amounts under one million dollars, a description of the type and dollar value of work designated for participation by MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs, and the time frames in which such work is scheduled to begin and end. When the utilization plan indicates that the bidder or proposer does not intend to award the target subcontracting percentage, the bid or proposal shall not be deemed responsive unless the agency has granted a pre-award waiver pursuant to paragraph 11 of this subdivision. \\par\n(6) For each contract for which a utilization plan has been submitted, the contracting agency shall require that within thirty days of the issuance of notice to proceed, the contractor submit a list of persons to which it intends to award subcontracts within the next twelve months. In the event that a contracting agency disapproves a contractor's selection of a subcontractor or subcontractors, the contracting agency shall allow such contractor a reasonable time to propose alternate subcontractors. \\par\n(7) For each contract for which a utilization plan has been submitted, the contractor shall, with each voucher for payment, and/or periodically as the agency may require, submit statements, certified under penalty of perjury, which shall include, but not be limited to, the total amount paid to subcontractors (including subcontractors that are not MBEs, WBEs or EBEs); the names, addresses and contact numbers of each MBE, WBE or EBE hired as a subcontractor pursuant to such plan as well as the dates and amounts paid to each MBE, WBE or EBE. The contractor shall also submit, along with its voucher for final payment, the total amount paid to subcontractors (including subcontractors that are not MBEs, WBEs or EBEs); and a final list, certified under penalty of perjury, which shall include the name, address and contact information of each subcontractor that is an MBE, WBE or EBE hired pursuant to such plan, the work performed by, and the dates and amounts paid to each. \\par\n(8) If payments made to, or work performed by, MBEs, WBEs or EBEs are less than the amount specified in the contractor's utilization plan, the agency shall take appropriate action in accordance with subdivision o of this section, unless the contractor has obtained a modification of its utilization plan pursuant to paragraph 12 of this subdivision. \\par\n(9) When advertising a solicitation for bids or proposals for a contract for which a participation goal has been established, agencies shall include in the advertisement a general statement that the contract will be subject to participation goals for MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs. \\par\n(10) In the event that a contractor with a contract that includes a utilization plan submits a request for a change order the value of which exceeds ten percent of such contract, the agency shall establish participation goals as if for a new contract for the work to be performed pursuant to such change order. \\par\n(11) Pre-award waiver. (i) Subject to subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, the contracting agency may grant a full or partial waiver of the target subcontracting percentage to a bidder or proposer who demonstrates that it has legitimate business reasons for proposing the level of subcontracting in its utilization plan. The contracting agency shall make its determination in light of factors which shall include, but not be limited to, whether the bidder or proposer has the capacity and the bona fide intention to perform the contract without any subcontracting, or to perform the contract without awarding the amount of subcontracts for under one million dollars represented by the target subcontracting percentage. In making such determination, the agency may consider whether the utilization plan is consistent with past subcontracting practices of the bidder or proposer, and whether the bidder or proposer has made good faith efforts to identify portions of the contract that it intends to subcontract. Within thirty days of the registration of a contract, the city chief contracting officer shall notify the council of any such waiver granted with respect to the contract. \\par\n(ii) The agency M/WBE officer shall provide written notice of requests for a full or partial waiver of the target subcontracting percentage to the division\\ul ,\\ulnone  [and] the city chief procurement officer\\ul , and the director,\\ulnone  and shall not approve any such request without the approval of the city chief procurement officer, provided that the city chief procurement officer, upon \\ul consultation with the director and with \\ulnone adequate assurances of an agency's ability to administer its utilization plan in accordance with the provisions of this section, may determine that further approval from the city chief procurement officer is not required with respect to such requests for an agency's contracts or particular categories of an agency's contracts. The city chief procurement officer shall notify the speaker of the council in writing within thirty days of the registration of a contract for which a request for a full or partial waiver of a target subcontracting percentage was granted, provided that where an agency has been authorized to grant waivers without approval of the chief procurement officer, such notice shall be provided to the speaker of the council by the agency. Such notification shall include, but not be limited to, the name of contractor, the original target subcontracting percentage, the waiver request, including all documentation, and an explanation for the approval of such request. \\par\n(12) Modification of utilization plans. (i) A contractor may request modification of its utilization plan after the award of a contract. Subject to subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, an agency may grant such request if it determines that such contractor has established, with appropriate documentary and other evidence, that it made all reasonable, good faith efforts to meet the goals set by the agency for the contract. In making such determination, the agency shall consider evidence of the following efforts, as applicable, along with any other relevant factors: \\par\n(A) The contractor advertised opportunities to participate in the contract, where appropriate, in general circulation media, trade and professional association publications and small business media, and publications of minority and women's business organizations; \\par\n(B) The contractor provided notice of specific opportunities to participate in the contract, in a timely manner, to minority and women's business organizations; \\par\n(C) The contractor sent written notices, by certified mail or facsimile, in a timely manner, to advise MBEs, WBEs or EBEs that their interest in the contract was solicited; \\par\n(D) The contractor made efforts to identify portions of the work that could be substituted for portions originally designated for participation by MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs in the contractor utilization plan, and for which the contractor claims an inability to retain MBEs, WBEs or EBEs; \\par\n(E) The contractor held meetings with MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs prior to the date their bids or proposals were due, for the purpose of explaining in detail the scope and requirements of the work for which their bids or proposals were solicited; \\par\n(F) The contractor made efforts to negotiate with MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs as relevant to perform specific subcontracts, or act as suppliers or service providers; \\par\n(G) Timely written requests for assistance made by the contractor to the agency M/WBE liaison officer and to the division; \\par\n(H) Description of how recommendations made by the division and the contracting agency were acted upon and an explanation of why action upon such recommendations did not lead to the desired level of participation of MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs. \\par\n(ii) The agency M/WBE officer shall provide written notice of requests for such modifications to the division\\ul ,\\ulnone  [and] the city chief procurement officer\\ul , and the director,\\ulnone  and shall not approve any such request for modification without the approval of the city chief procurement officer, provided that the city chief procurement officer, upon \\ul consultation with the director and with \\ulnone adequate assurances of an agency's ability to administer its utilization plan in accordance with the provisions of this section, may determine that further approval from the city chief procurement officer is not required with respect to such requests for an agency's contracts or particular categories of an agency's contracts. The city chief procurement officer, shall notify the speaker of the council in writing within seven days of the approval of a request for modification of a utilization plan, provided that where an agency has been authorized to grant modifications without approval of the chief procurement officer, such notice shall be provided to the speaker of the council by the agency. Such notification shall include, but not be limited to, the name of the contractor, the original utilization plan, the modification request, including all documentation, and an explanation for the approval of such request. \\par\n(iii) The agency M/WBE officer shall provide written notice to the contractor of its determination that shall include the reasons for such determination. \\par\n(13) For each contract in which a contracting agency has established participation goals, the agency shall evaluate and assess the contractor's performance in meeting each such goal. Such evaluation and assessment shall be a part of the contractor's overall contract performance evaluation required pursuant to section 333 of the charter. \\par\nj. Determining credit for MBE, WBE and EBE participation. (1) An agency's achievement of its annual goals shall be calculated as follows: \\par\n(i) The total dollar amount that an agency has paid or is obligated to pay to a prime contractor which is an MBE, WBE or EBE may be credited toward the relevant goal. \\par\n(ii) The total dollar amount that a prime contractor has paid or is obligated to pay to a subcontractor which is an MBE, WBE or EBE may be credited toward the relevant goal. \\par\n(iii) For requirements contracts, credit may be given for the actual dollar amount paid under the contract. \\par\n(iv) Where one or more MBEs, WBEs or EBEs is participating in a qualified joint venture, the dollar amount of the percentage of total profit to which MBEs, WBEs or EBEs are entitled pursuant to the joint venture agreement shall be credited toward the relevant goal. \\par\n(v) No credit shall be given for participation in a contract by an MBE, WBE or EBE that does not perform a commercially useful function. \\par\n(vi) No credit shall be given for the participation in a contract by any company that has not been certified as an MBE, WBE or EBE in accordance with section 1304 of the charter. \\par\n(vii) In the case of a contract for which the contractor is paid on a commission basis, the dollar amount of the contract may be determined on the basis of the commission earned or reasonably anticipated to be earned under the contract. \\par\n(viii) No credit shall be given to a contractor for participation in a contract by a graduate MBE, WBE or EBE. \\par\n(ix) The participation of a certified company shall not be credited toward more than one participation goal. \\par\n(2) A contractor's achievement of each goal established in its utilization plan shall be calculated in the same manner as described for calculating the achievement of agency utilization goals as described in paragraph (1) of this subdivision; provided that no credit shall be given to the contractor for the participation of a company that is not certified in accordance with section 1304 of the charter before the date that the agency approves the subcontractor. \\par\nk. Small purchases. (1) Each agency shall, consistent with the participation goals established in subdivision d of this section and such agency's utilization plan, establish goals for purchases valued at or below five thousand dollars which shall be made from MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs. \\par\n(2) Whenever an agency solicits bids or proposals for small purchases pursuant to section three hundred fourteen of the charter, the agency shall maintain records identifying the MBEs, WBEs and EBEs it solicited, which shall become part of the contract file. \\par\nl. Compliance reporting.
