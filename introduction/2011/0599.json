For the purposes of this section, “accessible to people with vision impairments” shall mean a taxicab that is equipped with instructions for contacting the commission in Braille and large-print text and if such taxicab has payment technology installed, such technology must  provide a payment option to permit visually impaired passengers to pay unassisted.  Such payment option shall have audio instruction and shall have audible announcements of the initial charge, the fare periodically during the trip, at the end of the trip, and when there is a rate code change and/or toll charge, in such manner as provided for and adopted by the commission.\n\tb. Commencing May 1, 2013, all taxicabs must be accessible to people with vision impairments.  The instructions about contacting the commission described in subdivision a of this section shall be on the same side and in the same passenger compartment in each taxicab, and the payment technology described in subdivision a of this section shall be in the same passenger compartment in each taxicab. \n\tc.
