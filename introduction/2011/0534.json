  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\nSection 1.  Legislative findings and intent. The Council finds that the City of New York has a substantial interest in determining the inherent power generation potential of the City’s water systems. The City’s water supply system, a wonder of modern-day engineering, relies nearly entirely on gravity to transport water from our upstate reservoirs to the City. This means of delivery has the potential to generate energy in a manner that does not harm water quality or interfere with water distribution. A system that harnesses this water flow may provide the City with emissions-free energy, which would reduce the City’s greenhouse gas emissions-as the City is obliged to do under Local Law No. 22 for the year 2008, the New York City Climate Protection Act. Power generated by our water supply system would not require costly and environmentally-damaging dams to be constructed; instead, it may be possible, subject to operational and economic considerations, to take advantage of existing infrastructure by utilizing hydropower technologies to capture energy and potentially achieve cost savings. \nAccordingly, the Council finds that it is in the best interests of the City to study the potential to generate clean energy using hydropower from our water supply and wastewater treatment infrastructure systems, as well as the bodies of water within the City’s jurisdiction.\n§2. Subchapter 4 of chapter 3 of title 24 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 24-366 to read as follows:\n§ 24-366 Assessment of electric generation viability. a. The department shall undertake a resource assessment of the city’s potable water supply and wastewater treatment systems and the natural bodies of water within the city’s jurisdiction to determine the potential of such systems and bodies of water for generating electricity. In performing such assessment the department shall include an examination of the potential to construct and operate energy generating facilities within such systems and natural bodies of water; the means for transmitting the electricity generated; the need to construct and operate generation-related infrastructure; grid-connection issues; generation system installation and maintenance costs; and risks to the operation of water supply and wastewater treatment systems and natural bodies of water posed by energy-generating facilities.\nb. The department shall conduct a technological review of in-conduit and free-flow hydropower technologies that are appropriate for the pressure and water flow rates for each site identified in the resource assessment. \nc. With information gathered during the resource assessment and technological review, the department shall conduct an economic analysis to determine the economic viability of generating electricity for each site identified in the resource assessment. \nd. The resource assessment, technological review and economic analysis shall be completed within eighteen months of the effective date of the local law that added this section and shall be submitted to the mayor and the speaker of the council.\n§3.

Legislative findings and intent. The Council finds that the City of New York has a substantial interest in determining the inherent power generation potential of the City\\rquote s water systems. The City\\rquote s water supply system, a wonder of modern-day engineering, relies nearly entirely on gravity to transport water from our upstate reservoirs to the City. This means of delivery has the potential to generate energy in a manner that does not harm water quality or interfere with water distribution. A system that harnesses this water flow may provide the City with emissions-free energy, which would reduce the City\\rquote s greenhouse gas emissions-as the City is obliged to do under Local Law No. 22 for the year 2008, the New York City Climate Protection Act. Power generated by our water supply system would not require costly and environmentally-damaging dams to be constructed; instead, it may be possible, subject to operational and economic considerations, to take advantage of existing infrastructure by utilizing hydropower technologies to capture energy and potentially achieve cost savings. \\par\nAccordingly, the Council finds that it is in the best interests of the City to study the potential to generate clean energy using hydropower from our water supply and wastewater treatment infrastructure systems, as well as the bodies of water within the City\\rquote s jurisdiction.\\cf0\\par\n\\'a72. Subchapter 4 of chapter 3 of title 24 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 24-366 to read as follows:\\par\n\\ul\\'a7 24-366 Assessment of electric generation viability. a.
