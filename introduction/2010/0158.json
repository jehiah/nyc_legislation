  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\nSection 1. Section 16-310 of the administrative code of the city of New York is REPEALED and a new section 16-310 is added to read as follows:\n§16-310 Public space recycling. a. The department shall expand its public space recycling program by increasing the number of public space recycling receptacles for the collection of recyclable materials including, but not limited to, metal, glass, plastic and paper designated as recyclable materials by the commissioner, to a cumulative total of at least five hundred public space recycling receptacles within three years of the effective date of this section, and to a cumulative total of at least one thousand public space recycling receptacles within ten years of the effective date of this section, at public locations in the city, which shall be in or near public parks, transit hubs, or commercial locations with high-pedestrian traffic.  As part of such expansion, the department shall place public space recycling receptacles in all business improvement districts that provide public litter basket maintenance.  Wherever practicable, public space recycling receptacles placed pursuant to this section shall be placed adjacent to public litter baskets. \n\nb.  Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision a of this section, the department shall not be required to expand the public space recycling program beyond existing or newly-established collection routes that can be efficiently serviced by the department. The commissioner shall have the authority to remove any public space recycling receptacle placed pursuant to this section, provided that the department replaces any such public space recycling receptacle, within thirty days of removal, with additional public space recycling receptacles at the same or in a different location on a one-to-one basis.  \nc.
