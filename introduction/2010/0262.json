  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\tSection 1.  Statement of findings and purpose.  The Council finds that current egress illumination requirements for lobbies and hallways under the New York city building code result in the electric lighting of egress spaces that are either sufficiently lit by daylight or that are unoccupied.  The Council therefore finds that energy could be saved by reducing such excessive lighting requirements for such spaces.\n§2.  Section BC 202 of the New York city building code is amended by adding certain definitions to be placed in appropriate alphabetical order to read as follows:\nOCCUPANT SENSOR. A device that detects the presence or absence of people within an area and causes lighting, equipment, or appliances to be regulated accordingly.   \nPHOTOSENSOR.  A device that detects the presence of visible light.\n§3.  Sections BC 1006.1 and BC 1006.2 of the New York city building code, as added by local law number 33 for the year 2007, are amended to read as follows:\n1006.1 Illumination Required. Exits, exit discharges, and public corridors shall be illuminated at all times by either daylight or electric lighting fixtures. Exit access components shall be illuminated by either daylight or electric lighting fixtures at all times [during occupancy] that the space served by the exit access component is occupied.\n\tExceptions:\n\t\t1.  Occupancies in Group U.\n\t\t2.  Aisle accessways in Group A.\n\t\t3. Dwelling units and sleeping units in Groups I-1, R-1, R-2 and R-3.\n\t\t4.  Sleeping units of Group I occupancies.\n1006.2 Illumination level. The means of egress illumination level shall not be less than [2 foot-candles (22 lux) at the floor level in exits, at exit discharges, and in public corridors, and shall not be less than 1 foot-candle (11 lux) at the floor level in exit access components other than public corridors] 1 foot-candle (11 lux) at the walking surface level. \nExceptions: \n1.\tFor auditoriums, theaters, concert or opera halls and similar assembly occupancies, the illumination at the floor level is permitted to be reduced during performances to not less than 0.5 foot-candle (5.38 lux) for aisles and cross aisles, and 0.2 foot-candle (2.15 lux) for other portions of the space, provided that the required illumination is automatically restored upon activation of a premise’s fire alarm system where such system is provided. Step lights shall be provided in accordance with Section 1024.11.4. \n2. \tSafe areas in assembly occupancies shall be illuminated in accordance with Section 1024.17.3.2. \n3. \tOpen exterior spaces used to receive occupants as Class 1 or 2 exits in assembly occupancies shall be illuminated in accordance with Section 1024.17.4.\n4.\tIn exits in buildings that contain photoluminescent exit path markings tested in laboratory conditions with 2 foot-candles (22 lux) of activating illumination, the illumination level shall not be less than 2 foot-candles (22 lux). \n§4.  Section BC 1006 of the New York city building code is amended by adding a new section 1006.2.1 to read as follows:\n1006.2.1 Sensors and Controls. Automatic, occupant sensor or photosensor lighting controls shall be permitted within means of egress, provided that the illumination level is not reduced to a level below the minimum requirements of section 1006.2 of this code, and the switch controllers are equipped for fail-safe operation ensuring that if the sensor or control fails, the lighting levels will be at the levels required by 1006.2 of this code.\n\t§5.  This local law shall take effect on January 1, 2011, except that the commissioner of buildings shall take such actions as are necessary for its implementation, including the promulgation of rules, prior to such effective date.\n.\nLS 1001\n9/21/2010 5:19 PM",
