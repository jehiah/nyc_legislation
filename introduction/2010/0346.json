  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection 1.  Legislative findings and intent.  The Council finds that our society needs energy sources to meet our demands that are sustainable, affordable and that contribute to energy independence.  Energy from the sun has the potential to meet our energy needs.  Solar energy is desirable because it is renewable, almost pollution free and would reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  By contrast, our current energy consumption patterns leave us vulnerable to energy instability and climate change.  \nThe Council further finds that renewable solar power can meet some of New York City’s energy needs, and that it is cleaner, cheaper, more sustainable and provides greater energy security than reliance on imported fossil fuels because the United States uses almost twenty-five percent of the world’s oil while having only three percent of the world’s oil reserves.  Growth in the solar power industry is also expected to create many jobs in New York City because the City has adequate solar resources to aggressively pursue increased solar power installations and ultimately this growth will reduce energy costs in the city that has the highest electricity costs in the nation  However’ existing Building Code provisions lack criteria for attachment of photovoltaic and solar thermal panels to building walls and ground mounted systems making it unduly burdensome to install certain solar power collection and generation systems now.  Therefore the Council finds that it is in the best interests of the City to remove these barriers and further incentivize installations of solar thermal and photovoltaic panels by developing detailed criteria for wall attachment of solar photovoltaic and solar thermal panels and anchorage for solar photovoltaic and solar thermal energy systems.\n§2. Section BC 1404.12 of the New York city building code is amended to read as follows: \nSection BC 1404.12. Photovoltaic and solar thermal panels on exterior walls. The department shall develop detailed criteria for the attachment of solar photovoltaic and solar thermal panels on exterior walls of buildings and structures.  Anchorage for solar energy generation systems, equipment and coverings, materials and other building related loads on exterior walls shall properly attach such energy generation system materials to the walls of such buildings and structures.  Methods, criteria and materials needed for the standardized attachment or anchorage of solar energy generation systems, coverings and associated materials to the exterior walls of buildings shall be developed by rule promulgated pursuant to these provisions.  \n§3.  The definition of “structure” in section 28-101.5 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows: \n“STRUCTURE”. That which is built or constructed, including among others: buildings, stadia, tents, reviewing stands, platforms, stagings, observation towers, radio towers, tanks, trestles, open sheds, shelters, fences, and display signs and ground mounted systems for solar photovoltaic and solar thermal installations.\n\t§4. Section 28-105.2. of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new item to read as follows: \n11. Solar photovoltaic and solar thermal permits: for the installation of ground mounted solar photovoltaic and solar thermal panels and anchorage for such sustainable energy systems.\n§5. This local law shall take effect ninety days after its enactment and shall be applicable to any construction documents pending before the department of buildings on such effective date and the commissioner of buildings shall take such measures as are necessary for its implementation, including the promulgation of rules, prior to such effective date.\nLS # 673\nSS 9/23/10 3:02 p.m..",
