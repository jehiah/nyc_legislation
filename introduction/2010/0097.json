  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n      Section 1. Legislative intent. The City Council finds that nearly every worker at some time during each year will need time off from work to take care of his or her health needs or the health needs of family members. Providing the right to earned sick time will therefore have a positive effect on the public health of the City and lessen the spread of and exposure to diseases. The Council further finds that supporting a healthy workforce will foster greater employee retention and productivity, and recognizes that responsible businesses that already have policies that allow time off that amounts to at least the minimum requirements under this law, and that can be taken for the same reasons and under the same conditions as enumerated in this legislation, will not be required to provide additional sick time. Providing sick time to workers at a time when the economy is improving, and ensuring that workers' jobs are protected when they need to take a sick day, strikes the right balance and will result in a more prosperous, safe and healthy City. \n      � 2. Section 2203 of the New York city charter is hereby amended by adding a new subdivision e, relettering current subdivisions e through g as subdivisions f through h, and amending relettered subdivisions f and h to read as follows:\n       (e) The commissioner shall have all powers as set forth in chapter 8 of title 20 of the administrative code relating to the receipt, investigation, and resolution of complaints thereunder regarding earned sick time.\n      [e](f) The commissioner, in the performance of said functions, including those functions pursuant to subdivision e of this section, shall be authorized to hold public and private hearings, administer oaths, take testimony, serve subpoenas, receive evidence, and to receive, administer, pay over and distribute monies collected in and as a result of actions brought for violations of laws relating to deceptive or unconscionable trade practices, or of related laws, and to promulgate, amend and modify rules and regulations necessary to carry out the powers and duties of the department.\n      [(f)] (g) The commissioner shall exercise the powers of a commissioner of public markets under the agriculture and markets law with respect to open air markets.\n      [(g)] (h) (1) Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of law, the department shall be authorized, upon due notice and hearing, to impose civil penalties for the violation of any laws or rules the enforcement of which is within the jurisdiction of the department pursuant to this charter, the administrative code or any other general, special or local law.  The department shall have the power to render decisions and orders and to impose civil penalties for all such violations, and to order equitable relief for and payment of monetary damages in connection with enforcement of chapter 8 of title 20 of the administrative code. Except to the extent that dollar limits are otherwise specifically provided, such civil penalties shall not exceed five hundred dollars for each violation. All proceedings authorized pursuant to this subdivision shall be conducted in accordance with rules promulgated by the commissioner. The remedies and penalties provided for in this subdivision shall be in addition to any other remedies or penalties provided for the enforcement of such provisions under any other law including, but not limited to, civil or criminal actions or proceedings.\n      (2) All such proceedings shall be commenced by the service of a notice of violation. The commissioner shall prescribe the form and wording of notices of violation. The notice of violation or copy thereof when filled in and served shall constitute notice of the violation charged, and, if sworn to or affirmed, shall be prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein.\n      (3)  For the purposes of this subdivision, no act or practice shall be deemed a deceptive trade practice unless it has been declared a deceptive trade practice and described with reasonable particularity in a local law or in a rule or regulation promulgated by the commissioner.\n      (4) Notwithstanding any other inconsistent provision of law, powers conferred upon the department by this subdivision may be exercised by the office of administrative trials and hearings consistent with orders of the mayor issued in accordance with subdivisions two and three of section one thousand forty-eight of this charter.\n      � 3. Title 20 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new chapter 8 to read as follows:\nCHAPTER 8\nEARNED SICK TIME ACT\n\t\t� 20-911 Short title.\n\t\t� 20-912 Definitions.\n\t\t� 20-913 Right to sick time; accrual.\n\t\t� 20-914 Use of sick time.\n\t\t� 20-915 Changing schedule.\n\t\t� 20-916 Collective bargaining agreements.\n      � 20-917 Public disasters.\n\t\t� 20-918 Retaliation and interference prohibited.\n\t\t� 20-919 Notice of rights.\t\n\t\t� 20-920 Employer records.\n\t\t� 20-921 Confidentiality and nondisclosure.\n� 20-922 Encouragement of more generous policies; no effect on more generous policies\n\t\t� 20-923 Other legal requirements.\n\t\t� 20-924  Enforcement and penalties.\n      � 20-911 Short title.

All employees have the right to sick time pursuant to this chapter. \n      1.\tAll employers that employ fifteen or more employees and all employers of one or more domestic workers shall provide paid sick time to their employees in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and the schedule set forth in section 7 of the local law which enacted this section.\n      2.\tAll employees not entitled to paid sick time pursuant to this chapter shall be entitled to unpaid sick time in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and the schedule set forth in section 7 of the local law which enacted this section.\n      3.\tAll employers that employ fifteen to nineteen employees, and all employers of one or more domestic workers, shall provide unpaid sick time in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and the schedule set forth in section 7 of the local law which enacted this section during any period in which, pursuant to the schedule set forth in section 7 of the local law which enacted this section, such employers are not required to provide paid sick time but employers that employ twenty or more employees are required to provide paid sick time.\n      b. All employers shall provide a minimum of one hour of sick time for every thirty hours worked by an employee, other than a domestic worker who shall accrue sick time pursuant to paragraph 2 of subdivision d of this section. Employers shall not be required under this chapter to provide more than forty hours of sick time for an employee in a calendar year. For purposes of this subdivision, any paid days of rest to which a domestic worker is entitled pursuant to section 161(1) of the labor law shall count toward such forty hours. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to discourage or prohibit an employer from allowing the accrual of sick time at a faster rate or use of sick time at an earlier date than this chapter requires. \n      c. An employer required to provide paid sick time pursuant to this chapter who provides an employee with an amount of paid leave, including paid time off, paid vacation, paid personal days or paid days of rest required to be compensated pursuant to section 161(1) of the labor law, sufficient to meet the requirements of this section and who allows such paid leave to be used for the same purposes and under the same conditions as sick time required pursuant to this chapter, is not required to provide additional paid sick time for such employee whether or not such employee chooses to use such leave for the purposes included in subdivision a of section 20-914 of this chapter. An employer required to provide unpaid sick time pursuant to this chapter who provides an employee with an amount of unpaid or paid leave, including unpaid or paid time off, unpaid or paid vacation, or unpaid or paid personal days, sufficient to meet the requirements of this section and who allows such leave to be used for the same purposes and under the same conditions as sick time required pursuant to this chapter, is not required to provide additional unpaid sick time for such employee whether or not such employee chooses to use such leave for the purposes set forth in subdivision a of section 20-914 of this chapter.\n      d. 1. For an employee other than a domestic worker, sick time as provided pursuant to this chapter shall begin to accrue at the commencement of employment or on the effective date of this local law, whichever is later, and an employee shall be entitled to begin using sick time on the one hundred twentieth calendar day following commencement of his or her employment or on the one hundred twentieth calendar day following the effective date of this local law, whichever is later. After the one hundred twentieth calendar day of employment or after the one hundred twentieth calendar day following the effective date of this local law, whichever is later, such employee may use sick time as it is accrued. \n      2. In addition to the paid day or days of rest to which a domestic worker is entitled pursuant to section 161(1) of the labor law, such domestic worker shall also be entitled to two days of paid sick time as of the date that such domestic worker is entitled to such paid day or days of rest and annually thereafter, provided that notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary, such two days of paid sick time shall be calculated in the same manner as the paid day or days of rest are calculated pursuant to the provisions of section 161(1) of the labor law. \n      e. Employees who are not covered by the overtime requirements of New York state law or regulations, including the wage orders promulgated by the New York commissioner of labor pursuant to article 19 or 19-A of the labor law, shall be assumed to work forty hours in each work week for purposes of sick time accrual unless their regular work week is less than forty hours, in which case sick time accrues based upon that regular work week.\n      f. The provisions of this chapter do not apply to (i) work study programs under 42 U.S.C. section 2753, (ii) employees for the hours worked and compensated by or through qualified scholarships as defined in 26 U.S.C. section 117, (iii) independent contractors who do not meet the definition of employee under section 190(2) of the labor law, and (iv) hourly professional employees.\n      g. Employees shall determine how much earned sick time they need to use, provided that employers may set a reasonable minimum increment for the use of sick time not to exceed four hours per day.\n      h. Except for domestic workers, unused sick time as provided pursuant to this chapter shall be carried over to the following calendar year; provided that no employer shall be required to (i) allow the use of more than forty hours of sick time in a calendar year or (ii) carry over unused paid sick time if the employee is paid for any unused sick time at the end of the calendar year in which such time is accrued and the employer provides the employee with an amount of paid sick time that meets or exceeds the requirements of this chapter for such employee for the immediately subsequent calendar year on the first day of the immediately subsequent calendar year.\n      i. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as requiring financial or other reimbursement to an employee from an employer upon the employee's termination, resignation, retirement, or other separation from employment for accrued sick time that has not been used.\n      j. If an employee is transferred to a separate division, entity or location in the city of New York, but remains employed by the same employer, such employee is entitled to all sick time accrued at the prior division, entity or location and is entitled to retain or use all sick time as provided pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. When there is a separation from employment and the employee is rehired within six months of separation by the same employer, previously accrued sick time that was not used shall be reinstated and such employee shall be entitled to use such accrued sick time at any time after such employee is rehired, provided that no employer shall be required to reinstate such sick time to the extent the employee was paid for unused accrued sick time prior to separation and the employee agreed to accept such pay for such unused sick time. \n      � 20-914 Use of sick time. a. An employee shall be entitled to use sick time for absence from work due to:\n      1. such employee's mental or physical illness, injury or health condition or need for medical diagnosis, care or treatment of a mental or physical illness, injury or health condition or need for preventive medical care; or\n      2. care of a family member who needs medical diagnosis, care or treatment of a mental or physical illness, injury or health condition or who needs preventive medical care; or\n      3. closure of such employee's place of business by order of a public official due to a public health emergency or such employee's need to care for a child whose school or childcare provider has been closed by order of a public official due to a public health emergency.\n      b. An employer may require reasonable notice of the need to use sick time. Where such need is foreseeable, an employer may require reasonable advance notice of the intention to use such sick time, not to exceed seven days prior to the date such sick time is to begin. Where such need is not foreseeable, an employer may require an employee to provide notice of the need for the use of sick time as soon as practicable.  \n      c. For an absence of more than three consecutive work days, an employer may require reasonable documentation that the use of sick time was authorized by subdivision a of this section. For sick time used pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2 of subdivision a of this section, documentation signed by a licensed health care provider indicating the need for the amount of sick time taken shall be considered reasonable documentation and an employer shall not require that such documentation specify the nature of the employee's or the employee's family member's injury, illness or condition, except as required by law. \n      d. Nothing herein shall prevent an employer from requiring an employee to provide written confirmation that an employee used sick time pursuant to this section. \n      e. An employer shall not require an employee, as a condition of taking sick time, to search for or find a replacement worker to cover the hours during which such employee is utilizing sick time. \n      f. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit an employer from taking disciplinary action, up to and including termination, against a worker who uses sick time provided pursuant to this chapter for purposes other than those described in this section.\n      � 20-915 Changing schedule. Upon mutual consent of the employee and the employer, an employee who is absent for a reason listed in subdivision a of section 20-914 of this chapter may work additional hours during the immediately preceding seven days if the absence was foreseeable or within the immediately subsequent seven days from that absence without using sick time to make up for the original hours for which such employee was absent, provided that an adjunct professor who is an employee at an institute of higher education may work such additional hours at any time during the academic term.

Legislative intent. The City Council finds that nearly every worker at some time during each year will need time off from work to take care of his or her health needs or the health needs of family members. Providing the right to earned sick time will therefore have a positive effect on the public health of the City and lessen the spread of and exposure to diseases. The Council further finds that supporting a healthy workforce will foster greater employee retention and productivity, and recognizes that responsible businesses that already have policies that allow time off that amounts to at least the minimum requirements under this law, and that can be taken for the same reasons and under the same conditions as enumerated in this legislation, will not be required to provide additional sick time. Providing sick time to workers at a time when the economy is improving, and ensuring that workers\\rquote  jobs are protected when they need to take a sick day, strikes the right balance and will result in a more prosperous, safe and healthy City. \\par\n\\'a7 2.
