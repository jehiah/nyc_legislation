  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\nSection 1. Legislative findings and intent. The Council finds that heating oil is a significant local source of air pollution in New York City. According to a report of the Environmental Defense Fund, the combustion of heating fuel is responsible for approximately 14% of the local emissions of fine particulate matter, more than vehicle traffic or power plants. Particulate matter and other pollutants, such as sulfur and heavy metals, contribute to asthma, heart disease and other public health problems.  \nThe Council finds that the use of bioheating fuel would reduce the emission of air pollutants, reduce cleaning and maintenance costs, increase the ease of handling fuel oils, provide other operational benefits, strengthen the alternative fuels market, support regional farmers and local businesses, and increase energy independence and the diversity of our energy supply. \nThe Council further finds that No. 4 and No. 6 residual heating oils are more polluting than No. 2 distillate heating oil. According to the New York City Community Air Survey’s 2009 winter data report, the strongest predictor of particulate matter and sulfur dioxide in the air in New York City is the density of nearby buildings that burn fuel oil. Boilers burning heavier residual oils also require more maintenance because of the need to clean burners fouled by the high sulfur content of the oil and the need to heat the non-viscous oils before they can be pumped and burned. Accordingly, the Council finds that is it necessary to address pollutants from the heating oil sector by reducing the sulfur level of No. 4 oil.  \n§2. Section 24-167 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows: \n§24-167 Improper use of equipment or apparatus prohibited. No person shall use or permit the use of equipment or apparatus for a purpose or in a manner which causes it to function improperly or not in accordance with its design. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the use of bioheating fuel in equipment that may be adapted for such use.\n§3. Subdivision a of section 24-168 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows: \n(a) No person shall cause or permit the use of a kind or grade of fuel in fuel burning equipment which is not designed to burn that kind or grade of fuel. Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to prohibit the use of bioheating fuel in equipment that may be adapted for such use.\n§4. Subchapter 8 of chapter 1 of title 24 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 24-168.1 to read as follows:\n§ 24-168.1 Clean heating oil. (a) Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following terms shall have the following meanings: \n(1) “Biodiesel” shall mean a fuel, designated B100, that is composed exclusively of mono-alkyl esters of long chain fatty acids derived from feedstock and that meets the specifications of the American Society of Testing and Materials designation D 6751-09a.\n(2) “Bioheating fuel” shall mean a fuel comprised of biodiesel blended with petroleum heating oil that meets the specifications of the American Society of Testing and Materials designation D 396-09a or other specifications as determined by the commissioner.  \n(3) “District steam system” shall mean a system for the production of steam and for its transmission and distribution through underground pipelines to multiple buildings. \n(4) “Emergency generator” shall mean a machine or device that combusts fuel to create electricity and that is used for the purpose of providing backup power in the event of a general interruption in electrical service.\n(5) “Feedstock” shall mean soybean oil, oil from annual covercrops, algal oil, biogenic waste oils, fats or greases, or non-food grade corn oil, provided that the commissioner may modify the definition of feedstock based on the vegetable oils, animal fats or cellulosic biomass listed in table 1 of 40 C.F.R. § 80.1426.\n(6) “Heating oil” shall mean oil refined for the purpose of use as fuel for combustion in a heating system and that meets the specifications of the American Society of Testing and Materials designation D 396-09a or other specifications as determined by the commissioner. \n(7) “Heating system” shall mean a system that generates heat, hot air, hot water or steam by combustion and distributes it within a building.\n(8) “Renewable biomass” shall mean crops and crop residue from existing agricultural land, tree residues, animal waste material and byproducts, slash and pre-commercial thinnings from non-federal forest lands, biomass cleared from the vicinity of buildings and other areas to reduce the risk of wildfire, algae, and separated yard waste or food waste.

Legislative findings and intent. The Council finds that heating oil is a significant local source of air pollution in New York City. According to a report of the Environmental Defense Fund, the combustion of heating fuel is responsible for approximately 14% of the local emissions of fine particulate matter, more than vehicle traffic or power plants. Particulate matter and other pollutants, such as sulfur and heavy metals, contribute to asthma, heart disease and other public health problems.  \\par\nThe Council finds that the use of bioheating fuel would reduce the emission of air pollutants, reduce cleaning and maintenance costs, increase the ease of handling fuel oils, provide other operational benefits, strengthen the alternative fuels market, support regional farmers and local businesses, and increase energy independence and the diversity of our energy supply. \\par\nThe Council further finds that No. 4 and No. 6 residual heating oils are more polluting than No. 2 distillate heating oil. According to the New York City Community Air Survey\\rquote s 2009 winter data report, the strongest predictor of particulate matter and sulfur dioxide in the air in New York City is the density of nearby buildings that burn fuel oil. Boilers burning heavier residual oils also require more maintenance because of the need to clean burners fouled by the high sulfur content of the oil and the need to heat the non-viscous oils before they can be pumped and burned. Accordingly, the Council finds that is it necessary to address pollutants from the heating oil sector by reducing the sulfur level of No. 4 oil.  \\par\n\\'a72. Section 24-167 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:\\ul  \\par\n\\ulnone\\'a724-167 Improper use of equipment or apparatus prohibited.
