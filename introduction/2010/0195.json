  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\t Section One.  Legislative history and intent.  The goals of the New York City juvenile justice system are to ensure public safety and to help youth within the system become healthy, productive and law abiding New Yorkers.  New York City recognizes what studies have shown: institutionalizing youth involved in the juvenile justice system does little to advance those goals.  Accordingly, since 2002, the City reduced the number of youth being sent to State-administered residential facilities by 56%.  The City also developed alternative to placement and detention programs that focus on addressing the underlying causes of a youth's delinquency such as the Juvenile Justice Initiative and the Collaborative Family Initiative.  Most recently, in January 2010, Mayor Bloomberg announced the integration of the Department of Juvenile Justice (\"DJJ\") with the Administration of Children Services (\"ACS\") in order to expand programming designed to reduce recidivism among youth involved in the juvenile justice system.  ACS will assume all of DJJ's responsibilities, including the administration of juvenile detention facilities and ensuring the well-being of youth in its care.\nWith the integration of DJJ into ACS, the New York City Council intends to further reduce the City's reliance on institutional placement of justice involved youth by increasing the availability of alternative to detention and placement programs.  Studies show that alternative to detention and placement programs are less costly than institutionalization and that they are more effective at reducing recidivism, as youth learn how to relate to situations within their communities and with the people they interact with most.  The Council further finds that the integration of DJJ into ACS will produce cost savings and operational efficiencies by combining two agencies that serve overlapping populations.   With the integration of DJJ into ACS, the Council finds there is an opportunity to work with youth and their families to set youth on a path toward school, work and successful adulthood.  The integration will serve to strengthen and enhance the services available to justice involved youth.  These services will continue to address their special needs including, but not limited to, mental health issues or drug and alcohol dependency, so that they are able to get the help that they need and stay in their communities whenever possible. \n§ 2.  Section 616 of the New York city charter, as amended by the electors at the general election on November  6, 2001, is amended to read as follows:\n§616.  Deputies.  The commissioner shall appoint at least [one] three deputy [commissioner] commissioners.\n§3.  Section 617 of the New York city charter, subdivision b as amended by local law 52 for the year 2003 and subdivision c as added by local law 25 for the year 2005, is amended to read as follows:  \n§ 617. Powers and duties. a. The commissioner shall have the powers and perform the duties of a commissioner of social services under the social services law for the purpose of fulfilling his or her responsibilities under this [chapter] section. The commissioner shall have the power to perform functions related to the care and protection of children including, but not limited to:\n1. performing the functions of a child protective service, including without limitation, the receipt and investigation of reports of child abuse and maltreatment;\n2. providing children and families with preventative services for the purpose of averting the impairment or disruption of families which could result in the placement of children in foster care; enabling children placed in foster care to return to their families; and reducing the likelihood that a child who has been discharged from foster care may return to such care;\n3. providing suitable and appropriate care for children who are in the care, custody, or guardianship of the commissioner;\n4. providing appropriate daycare, Head Start and other child-care services; and\n5. providing services to ensure that legally responsible parents provide child support.\nb. Wherever the powers and duties of an agency other than the administration for children's services as set forth in the charter or administrative code confer any authority over the areas of child welfare, child development or child support enforcement within the jurisdiction of the commissioner of children's services pursuant to section six hundred seventeen of this chapter, such powers and duties shall be deemed to be within the jurisdiction of the administration for children's services and shall be exercised by such administration; provided that such other agency may exercise such powers and duties where required by state or federal law, or, with respect to child support enforcement or determinations of eligibility for subsidized child care, by the department of social services as directed by the mayor.\nc. No agency practice, including but not limited to any tracking system, record keeping or reporting system or data collection system or device, may prejudice the rights of, stigmatize or otherwise harm a person because of his or her gender or relationship to a child or children involved in a child protective matter. To the extent that requirements of this subdivision are subject to state approval, the agency will request permission to make any changes in policy necessary to comply with the provisions of this subdivision within ninety days of the effective date of the local law that added this subdivision.

Legislative history and intent.  The goals of the New York City juvenile justice system are to ensure public safety and to help youth within the system become healthy, productive and law abiding New Yorkers.  New York City recognizes what studies have shown: institutionalizing youth involved in the juvenile justice system does little to advance those goals.  Accordingly, since 2002, the City reduced the number of youth being sent to State-administered residential facilities by 56%.  The City also developed alternative to placement and detention programs that focus on addressing the underlying causes of a youth's delinquency such as the Juvenile Justice Initiative and the Collaborative Family Initiative.  Most recently, in January 2010, Mayor Bloomberg announced the integration of the Department of Juvenile Justice (\"DJJ\") with the Administration of Children Services (\"ACS\") in order to expand programming designed to reduce recidivism among youth involved in the juvenile justice system.  ACS will assume all of DJJ's responsibilities, including the administration of juvenile detention facilities and ensuring the well-being of youth in its care.\\par\n\\pard\\nowidctlpar\\hyphpar0\\fi720\\sl480\\slmult1 With the integration of DJJ into ACS, the New York City Council intends to further reduce the City's reliance on institutional placement of justice involved youth by increasing the availability of alternative to detention and placement programs.  Studies show that alternative to detention and placement programs are less costly than institutionalization and that they are more effective at reducing recidivism, as youth learn how to relate to situations within their communities and with the people they interact with most.  The Council further finds that the integration of DJJ into ACS will produce cost savings and operational efficiencies by combining two agencies that serve overlapping populations.   With the integration of DJJ into ACS, the Council finds there is an opportunity to work with youth and their families to set youth on a path toward school, work and successful adulthood.  The integration will serve to strengthen and enhance the services available to justice involved youth.  These services will continue to address their special needs including, but not limited to, mental health issues or drug and alcohol dependency, so that they are able to get the help that they need and stay in their communities whenever possible. \\par\n\\'a7 2.  Section 616 of the New York city charter, as amended by the electors at the general election on November  6, 2001, is amended to read as follows:\\par\n\\pard\\nowidctlpar\\fi720\\sl480\\slmult1\\'a7616.

Wherever the powers and duties of an agency other than the administration for children's services as set forth in the charter or administrative code confer any authority over the areas of child welfare, child development or child support enforcement within the jurisdiction of the commissioner of children's services pursuant to section six hundred seventeen of this chapter, such powers and duties shall be deemed to be within the jurisdiction of the administration for children's services and shall be exercised by such administration; provided that such other agency may exercise such powers and duties where required by state or federal law, or, with respect to child support enforcement or determinations of eligibility for subsidized child care, by the department of social services as directed by the mayor.\\par\nc.
