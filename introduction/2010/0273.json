  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection 1.  Section BC 3307.2.1 of the New York city building code, as added by local law number 33 for the year 2007, is amended to read as follows: \n3307.2.1 Temporary walkways. Temporary walkways shall comply with the following:\n1. Temporary walkways shall be of sufficient width to accommodate the pedestrian traffic, but in no case shall it be less than 5 feet (1524 mm) in width, and shall be provided with a durable walking surface.\n2.  All temporary walkways shall be illuminated at all times either by [natural] daylight or [artificial] electric light. The level of illumination shall be [the equivalent of that produced by 200 watt, 3400 lumen minimum, standard incandescent lamps enclosed in vandal-proof fixtures and spaced 15 feet (4572 mm) apart and 8 feet (2438 mm) above the floor level] a minimum of 1 foot-candle (11 lux) measured at the level of the walking surface. All lamps shall be enclosed in vandal-proof fixtures, have a minimum luminous efficacy of 45 lumens per watt or greater and be rated to operate at temperatures of 5 degrees Fahrenheit and higher. [Artificial] Electric lighting units shall be inspected [nightly] daily; and burned out or inoperative units shall be replaced or repaired immediately.  Photosensors may be used to control electric lighting according to the amount of daylight available. All photosensors shall be equipped for fail-safe operation ensuring that if the sensor or control fails, the lamps will provide the lighting levels required by this section.  \n3.  Temporary walkways shall be provided with adequate slopes so that they are accessible and shall be designed to support all imposed loads, and in no case shall the design live load be less than 150 pounds per square foot (732.3 kg/m2).\n4.  Where permission has been granted by the Department of Transportation to locate a temporary walkway beyond the curb line, such temporary walkway shall be provided with a guardrail in accordance with the Department of Transportation’s requirements.\n\t§2.

Foot bridges shall be provided with adequate slopes so that they are accessible and shall be designed to support all imposed loads and in no case shall the design live load be less than 150 pounds per square foot (732.3 kg/m2).  The walkway on such bridge shall be provided with guardrails for its entire length and shall have cleats to prevent slipping.  Where planks are used to pave the walkway, they shall be laid close and securely fastened to prevent displacement.
