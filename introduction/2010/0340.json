  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\nSection 1. Statement of findings and purpose.  Sun control devices help combat heat gain and prevent glare, decreasing the energy needed to cool a building.  Presently, the New York city building code permits these shading devices to project a maximum of 10 inches beyond the street line of a building, thus limiting their effectiveness.  This bill would increase the maximum allowable projection of a sun control device beyond the street line of a building to 2 feet 6 inches, in alignment with proposed revisions to the zoning resolution of the city of New York, in order to expand the effectiveness of such sun control device.\n§ 2.  Section BC 202 of the New York city building code, as amended by local law number 47 for the year 2010, is amended by adding a new definition to be placed in alphabetical order to read as follows:\nSUN CONTROL DEVICE.  An architectural projection that provides protection against solar radiation entering a building through glazed areas and is supported by the building to which it is attached.  Sun control device includes, but is not limited to, a fixed, retractable or rotating sun control device.  A fixed sun control device has no moving parts and is typically composed of horizontal overhangs or vertical fins. A retractable sun control device extends or retracts, and in the extended position casts a shadow on designated portions of the building.

Presently, the New York city building code permits these shading devices to project a maximum of 10 inches beyond the street line of a building, thus limiting their effectiveness.  This bill would increase the maximum allowable projection of a sun control device beyond the street line of a building to 2 feet 6 inches, in alignment with proposed revisions to the zoning resolution of the city of New York, in order to expand the effectiveness of such sun control device.\\par\n\\cf0\\'a7 2.
