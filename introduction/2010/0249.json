  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\nSection 1.  Legislative findings and declaration.  Stepstreets are sets of stairwells located between avenues to connect streets that have a significant height differential and they may range in size from six steps to one hundred and seventy-one steps.  New York City has ninety-four stepstreets, most of them concentrated in neighborhoods in the west Bronx and upper Manhattan.\nThese stepstreets are of vital importance to the City in that they provide major access for the citizens of New York City, and are vital links to and from subway and bus lines, commercial areas, and residential areas.  However, many of the stepstreets in New York City have been neglected by City agencies in terms of repair, maintenance, and safety.  There have been a growing number of complaints to local officials and community boards regarding criminal conduct such as drug trafficking, littering, and dumping on the stepstreets. The Department of Education has excluded stepstreets from the walking routes used to calculate whether a student is eligible for public transportation due to problems with safety and maintenance.\nThe Council finds that there has been a failure to properly maintain stepstreets. Based on this finding, the Council determines that it is necessary to create a task force to repair, maintain, and clean stepstreets. \n\t§2.  Stepstreets Task Force.  a. There shall be a task force to study the City’s stepstreets and to make specific recommendations to the mayor and council for the effective repair, maintenance, safety and cleanliness of stepstreets. \n\tb.
