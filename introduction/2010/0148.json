  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\nSection 1. Subdivision c of section 16-305 of the administrative code of the city of New York is REPEALED and a new subdivision c is added to read as follows:\nc.  1.  Prior to commencing delivery of department-managed recyclable materials to the designated recycling processing facility at the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal, the commissioner shall designate as recyclable materials, and require the source separation of, rigid plastic containers.\n2.  If the commissioner, in his or her discretion, determines that the cost to the city of recycling rigid plastic containers required to be designated as recyclable materials pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision is not reasonable in comparison with the cost of recycling only metal, glass and plastic that have been designated as recyclable materials as of the effective date of the local law that added this subdivision, the commissioner shall within ten business days notify and provide documentation to the council of the factors relied upon to make such determination and shall not be required to designate any such rigid plastic containers as recyclable materials. \n3.  If the commissioner determines that the cost to the city of recycling rigid plastic containers is not reasonable in comparison with the cost of recycling only metal, glass and plastic that have been designated as recyclable materials as of the effective date of the local law that added this subdivision, the commissioner shall annually reevaluate the cost to the city of designating such rigid plastic containers as recyclable materials, and shall annually make a new determination as to whether the cost of designating such containers as recyclable materials is reasonable in comparison with the cost of recycling only metal, glass and plastic that have been designated as recyclable materials as of the effective date of the local law that added this subdivision and shall report such evaluations to the council as part of the department’s annual recycling report required pursuant to subdivision k of section 16-305 of this chapter.
