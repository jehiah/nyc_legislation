The Energy Conservation Construction Code of New York State (“State Energy Code”), authorized by Article 11 of the New York State Energy Law, sets standards for the energy performance of buildings throughout New York.  The State Energy Law expressly permits a municipality to promulgate a local energy conservation construction code that is more stringent than the State Energy Code.  In 2009, New York City established such a local energy conservation code, the New York City Energy Conservation Code, with the enactment of Local Law 85 of 2009.  In April 2010, the New York State Fire Prevention and Building Code Council amended the State Energy Code in its entirety. The amendment is based on the 2009 edition of the International Energy Conservation Code, published by the International Code Council, Inc. (“2009 IECC”). Such 2010 State Energy Code is scheduled to take effect on December 28, 2010.  \nSection 101.3.1 of the 2010 State Energy Code provides that such code “is intended to comply with the requirements of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the ‘ARRA’), i.e., to be a building energy code for residential buildings and for commercial buildings that meets or exceeds the model codes mentioned in the ARRA, or achieves equivalent or greater energy savings.”  Section 410 of Title IV of Division A of the ARRA specifies that states and localities should implement the 2009 IECC and the 2007 edition of standard ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1, entitled “Energy Standard for Buildings Except Low-Rise Residential Buildings,” published by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc. (“ASHRAE 90.1-2007”).\nSection 101.3.1 of the 2010 State Energy Code further provides that the New York State Department of State has determined:\n1.\tThat a building energy code that is applicable to both residential buildings and commercial buildings and that meets or exceeds the 2009 IECC, or achieves equivalent or greater energy savings, meets or exceeds the requirements of the ARRA;\n2. That the 2010 State Energy Code meets or exceeds the 2009 IECC, or achieves equivalent or greater energy savings; and\n3.\tAccordingly, that the 2010 State Energy Code meets or exceeds the requirements of the ARRA.  \nThe Council finds that it is reasonable and necessary to amend certain sections of Chapter 10 of Title 28 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York in order to ensure that the New York City Energy Conservation Code remains at least as stringent as the 2010 State Energy Code, as the State Energy Law requires.  \n§2. Item 3 of Section 28-105.2 of the administrative code of the city of New York as added by local law number 33 for the year 2007, is amended to read as follows:\n3.  Foundation and earthwork permits:  for the construction or alteration of foundations, including earthwork, excavation, [and] fill, and foundation insulation.\n§3. Section 28-1001.1 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 85 for the year 2009, is amended to read as follows: \n§28-1001.1 Adoption of the energy code. In accordance with section 11-109 of the New York state energy law, [that] which permits any municipality to promulgate a local energy conservation construction code, the city of New York hereby adopts the [2007] 2010 energy conservation construction code of New York state in effect and any amendments thereto that are more stringent than such code adopted by the city of New York as the minimum requirements for the design, construction and alteration of buildings for the effective use of energy in the city. Such adoption shall be subject to amendments pursuant to local law and set forth in section 1001.2 of this chapter, which shall be known and cited as the “New York city amendments to the [2007] 2010 energy conservation construction code of New York state.” Such edition of the [2007] 2010 energy conservation construction code of New York state with such New York city amendments shall together be known and cited as the “New York city energy conservation code.”  \n§4. Section 28-1001.2 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 85 for the year 2009, is REPEALED and reenacted to read as follows: \n§28-1001.2 New York city amendments to the 2010 energy conservation construction code of New York state. The following New York city amendments to the 2010 energy conservation construction code of New York state are hereby adopted as set forth in this section:  \nChapter 1\nChapter 1 is deleted in its entirety and a new Chapter 1 is added to read as follows:\nCHAPTER 1\nADMINISTRATION\nSECTION ECC 101\nSCOPE AND GENERAL REQUIREMENTS\n101.1 General.

Statement of findings and purpose. The Energy Conservation Construction Code of New York State (\\ldblquote State Energy Code\\rdblquote ), authorized by Article 11 of the New York State Energy Law, sets standards for the energy performance of buildings throughout New York.  The State Energy Law expressly permits a municipality to promulgate a local energy conservation construction code that is more stringent than the State Energy Code.  In 2009, New York City established such a local energy conservation code, the New York City Energy Conservation Code, with the enactment of Local Law 85 of 2009.  In April 2010, the New York State Fire Prevention and Building Code Council amended the State Energy Code in its entirety. The amendment is based on the 2009 edition of the International Energy Conservation Code, published by the International Code Council, Inc. (\\ldblquote 2009 IECC\\rdblquote ). Such 2010 State Energy Code is scheduled to take effect on December 28, 2010.  \\par\nSection 101.3.1 of the 2010 State Energy Code provides that such code \\ldblquote is intended to comply with the requirements of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the \\lquote ARRA\\rquote ), i.e., to be a building energy code for residential buildings and for commercial buildings that meets or exceeds the model codes mentioned in the ARRA, or achieves equivalent or greater energy savings.\\rdblquote   Section 410 of Title IV of Division A of the ARRA specifies that states and localities should implement the 2009 IECC and the 2007 edition of standard ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1, entitled \\ldblquote Energy Standard for Buildings Except Low-Rise Residential Buildings,\\rdblquote  published by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc. (\\ldblquote ASHRAE 90.1-2007\\rdblquote ).\\par\nSection 101.3.1 of the 2010 State Energy Code further provides that the New York State Department of State has determined:\\par\n\\pard\\ltrpar\\nowidctlpar\\hyphpar0\\fi-360\\li1080\\sl480\\slmult1\\qj 1.\\tab That a building energy code that is applicable to both residential buildings and commercial buildings and that meets or exceeds the 2009 IECC, or achieves equivalent or greater energy savings, meets or exceeds the requirements of the ARRA;\\par\n2. That the 2010 State Energy Code meets or exceeds the 2009 IECC, or achieves equivalent or greater energy savings; and\\par\n3.\\tab Accordingly, that the 2010 State Energy Code meets or exceeds the requirements of the ARRA.  \\par\n\\pard\\ltrpar\\nowidctlpar\\hyphpar0\\fi1440\\sl480\\slmult1\\qj The Council finds that it is reasonable and necessary to amend certain sections of Chapter 10 of Title 28 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York in order to ensure that the New York City Energy Conservation Code remains at least as stringent as the 2010 State Energy Code, as the State Energy Law requires.  \\highlight1\\ul\\par\n\\pard\\ltrpar\\nowidctlpar\\hyphpar0\\fi1440\\sl480\\slmult1\\highlight0\\ulnone\\'a72.
