  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\nSection 1. Legislative findings and intent.  It is the Council’s intention that consumers in New York City have access to comprehensive information about and timely access to all types of reproductive health services including, but not limited to, accurate pregnancy diagnosis, prenatal care, emergency contraception and abortion.\nBased on the evidence before it, the Council finds that some pregnancy services centers in New York City engage in deceptive practices, which include misleading consumers about the types of goods and services they provide on-site, misleading consumers about the types of goods and services for which they will provide referrals to third parties, and misleading consumers about the availability of licensed medical providers that provide or oversee services on-site.  Such deceptive practices are used in advertisements for pregnancy services centers, which are misleading as to the services the centers do or do not provide.\nThe Council further finds that such deceptive practices can impede and/or delay consumers’ access to reproductive health services.  Some pregnancy services centers have engaged in conduct that wrongly leads clients to believe that they have received reproductive health care and counseling from a licensed medical provider. Prenatal care, abortion and emergency contraception are all time sensitive services.  Increasing the proportion of women receiving adequate and early prenatal care is a pronounced objective of the United States Department of Health and Human Services.  The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urges that comprehensive prenatal care begin as soon as a woman decides to become pregnant.  Similar to prenatal care, delayed access to abortion and emergency contraception poses a threat to public health.  Delay in accessing abortion or emergency contraception creates increased health risks and financial burdens, and may eliminate a women’s ability to obtain these services altogether, severely limiting her reproductive health options.\nThe Council seeks both to stop pregnancy services centers that are currently engaging in deceptive practices in New York City from continuing to do so and to prevent pregnancy services centers from engaging in deceptive practices in New York City in the future.  The Council fully embraces the right of pregnancy services centers to express their views about reproductive health services and seeks only to prevent and/or mitigate the effects of deceptive practices.   Existing laws do not adequately protect consumers from the deceptive practices targeted by this legislation.  Specifically, anti-fraud statutes have proven ineffective in prosecuting deceptive centers because the vulnerable population served by these centers faces potential threats or injury to their well-being by bringing forward complaints which often contain highly sensitive personal information, such as the circumstances surrounding a client’s unplanned pregnancy.  Clients have demonstrated a reluctance to come forward and disclose the events that occurred when they attempted to obtain such services.  \nThe Council also finds that pregnancy services centers may collect sensitive personal and health information from consumers inquiring about or seeking services at such centers. However, most pregnancy services centers are not subject to the federal and state laws that limit the disclosure of such information by providers of medical care.  If such information were to be improperly released, it could be significantly damaging to the consumers who utilize such centers.  The release of such private information is particularly troublesome where the client is a victim of intimate partner violence and/or domestic abuse.  As a result, the Council finds it necessary to create protections for the personal and health information provided by consumers inquiring about or seeking services at pregnancy services centers.\n§ 2. Chapter 5 of Title 20 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new subchapter 17 to read as follows:\n\nSUBCHAPTER 17\nPREGNANCY Services  CENTERS\n\n§ 20-815 Definitions.\n§ 20-816 Required disclosures.\n§ 20-817 Confidentiality of health and personal information.\n§ 20-818 Penalties.\n§ 20-819 Hearing authority.\n§ 20-820 Civil cause of action.\n§ 20-815 Definitions.

Any client that consents to the release of health or personal information pursuant to subdivision b of this section must have a clear and complete understanding of the nature of such release and the content of such information. \nd. Notwithstanding subdivisions a and b of this section, if any pregnancy services center employee or volunteer has reasonable cause to suspect that a client receiving services at a pregnancy services center is an abused or maltreated child, such employee or volunteer may report such abuse to the statewide central register of child abuse and maltreatment in accordance with section four-hundred thirteen or four-hundred fourteen of the social services law of New York, and to the administration for children’s services, and/or the police department, and cooperate in the investigation related thereto to the extent permitted by applicable state and federal law.

Reporting child abuse and maltreatment as defined in this subdivision to an individual or entity other than the statewide central registrar of child abuse and maltreatment, the administration for children’s services or the police department shall be a violation of this section.\n§ 20-818 Penalties. a. Any pregnancy services center that violates the provisions of sections 20-816 or 20-817 of this subchapter or any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder shall be liable for a civil penalty of not less than two hundred dollars nor more than one thousand dollars for the first violation and a civil penalty of not less than five hundred dollars nor more than two thousand-five hundred dollars for each succeeding violation.\nb.

For the purposes of this subdivision, any violations at a pregnancy services center shall not be included in determining the number of violations of any subsequently established pregnancy services center at that location unless the commissioner establishes that the subsequent operator of such pregnancy services center acquired the premises or pregnancy services center, in whole or in part, for the purpose of permitting the previous operator of the pregnancy services center who had been found guilty of violating section 20-816 of this subchapter to avoid the effect of such violations.\n(2) Orders of the commissioner issued pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision shall be posted at the premises that are the subject of the order(s).\n(3) Ten days after the posting of an order issued pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision, and upon the written directive of the commissioner, officers and employees of the department and officers of the New York city police department are authorized to act upon and enforce such orders.\n(4) A closing directed by the department pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision shall not constitute an act of possession, ownership or control by the city of the closed premises.\n(5) Mutilation or removal of a posted order of the commissioner or his designee shall be punishable by a fine of not more than two hundred fifty dollars or by imprisonment not exceeding fifteen days, or both, provided such order contains therein a notice of such penalty.
