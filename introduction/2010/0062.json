When a test made by the department [of environmental protection] indicates that there is a leak at a tap or in a service pipe and such leak is located in the portion of the service pipe that extends from the property line to the city-owned water main pipe, if conditions permit, a notice shall be served by a representative of such department upon the owner or occupant of the premises being supplied by such tap or service pipe.

In the event that a tap is shut off by the department because of a leak in the portion of the service pipe that extends from the property line to the city-owned water main pipe, the owner or occupant of the affected premises shall be notified that the tap has been closed and that the department will engage a licensed plumber within three days [should be engaged] to make the necessary repair and take charge of the street excavation.

In the event that a tap is shut off by the department because of a leak in the portion of the service pipe that extends from the dwelling to the property line, the owner or occupant of the affected premises shall be notified that the tap has been closed and that a licensed plumber should be engaged to make the necessary repair and take charge of the street excavation.  If the owner or occupant fails within three days after notice, excepting emergencies as determined by the commissioner, to engage a licensed plumber, the tap shall remain closed and the department of environmental protection shall backfill the excavation.\nd. If the department lacks a sufficient number of licensed plumbers in-house, the department shall within six months of enactment of this local law, establish a list of pre-qualified licensed plumbers to be utilized on a rotating basis to perform the repairs on leaks occurring in the portion of the service pipe that extends from the property line to the city-owned water main pipe.\n§2.
