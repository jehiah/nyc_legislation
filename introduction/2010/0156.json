  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\nSection 1. Section 16-307 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 19 for the year 1989, is amended to read as follows:\n§16-307 City agency waste. a. The commissioner shall[, within six months of the effective date of this chapter,] adopt, amend and implement [regulations requiring] rules, as necessary, governing the source separation or post-collection separation, collection, processing, marketing, and sale of designated recyclable materials including, but not limited to, designated metal, glass, plastic and paper generated by [city mayoral and non-mayoral agencies, including the council and the board of estimate] any agency, as such term is defined in section 1-112 of the code.  \nb. Every agency shall, no later than July first, two thousand eleven, prepare and submit to the commissioner for approval, a waste prevention, reuse and recycling plan.  Such plan shall provide for the source separation of designated metal, glass, plastic and paper, and such other designated recyclable materials as the commissioner deems appropriate, in all offices and buildings occupied by agencies that receive collection service from the department and, to the extent practicable, in those that receive private carter collection.  Such plans shall provide for the source separation of designated recyclable materials in the lobbies of such offices or buildings that receive department collection, unless the placement of bins for the source separation of designated recyclable materials would be in violation of any other provision of law, and, to the extent practicable, in the lobbies of such offices or buildings that receive private carter collection.  Each agency shall designate a lead recycling or sustainability coordinator to oversee implementation of such plans.  If an agency has offices in more than one city-owned building, then such agency shall designate one assistant coordinator for each building in which such agency has offices, except the building in which the lead coordinator has his or her office, to assist the agency’s lead coordinator.  \nc.
