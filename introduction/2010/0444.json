  "TextID": 48270,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows: \n\nSection 1. Findings and Intent. Many city agencies administer facilities that provide services, including temporary places to stay, for families and individuals who do not have anywhere to stay overnight or who need assistance finding or maintaining stable housing.  While the Department of Homeless Services (“DHS”) administers the majority of these facilities and DHS regularly reports on the utilization of the services in its purview, it does not report on those administered by other city agencies, such as the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, the Human Resources Administration and the Department of Youth and Community Development.  Not having regular data concerning the number of people who utilize such facilities and who are being served by agencies other than DHS can result in the significant undercounting of the number of people in New York City who need temporary emergency housing and those who utilize associated services.  In order to accurately determine the extent of the need for temporary emergency housing and associated services in the city, the Council finds that all agencies that provide such housing and services must routinely report the number of individuals and/or families who utilize such facilities.  \n§ 2.

Findings and Intent. Many city agencies administer facilities that provide services, including temporary places to stay, for families and individuals who do not have anywhere to stay overnight or who need assistance finding or maintaining stable housing.  While the Department of Homeless Services (\\ldblquote DHS\\rdblquote ) administers the majority of these facilities and DHS regularly reports on the utilization of the services in its purview, it does not report on those administered by other city agencies, such as the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, the Human Resources Administration and the Department of Youth and Community Development.  Not having regular data concerning the number of people who utilize such facilities and who are being served by agencies other than DHS can result in the significant undercounting of the number of people in New York City who need temporary emergency housing and those who utilize associated services.  In order to accurately determine the extent of the need for temporary emergency housing and associated services in the city, the Council finds that all agencies that provide such housing and services must routinely report the number of individuals and/or families who utilize such facilities.  \\par\n\\'a7 2.
