  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection 1.  Legislative findings and intent.  The Council finds that our society needs energy sources to meet our demands that are sustainable, affordable and that contribute to energy independence.  Energy from the sun is renewable and has the potential to meet our energy needs.  Solar energy is almost pollution free and would reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Without the use of renewable energy our current energy consumption patterns leave us vulnerable to energy instability and climate change.  \nThe Council further finds that renewable solar power can meet some of New York City’s energy needs. However existing Building Code provisions lack criteria for attachment of photovoltaic and solar thermal panels to buildings or structures making it unduly burdensome to install solar power collection and generation systems now.  Therefore the Council finds that it is in the best interests of the City to remove these barriers and further incentivize installations of solar thermal and photovoltaic panels by developing detailed criteria for roof attachment of solar photovoltaic and solar thermal panels and anchorage for other sustainable energy systems.\n\t§2.The definition of “rooftop structure” in Section BC 1502.1 of the New York City building code, as added by local law number 33 for the year 2007, is amended to read as follows: \n“Rooftop structure” shall mean an enclosed or unenclosed structure on or above the roof of any part of a building including a rooftop anchorage for the attachment of solar panels to a roof as part of a solar energy system installation.\n§3. Section BC 1509 of the New York City building code, as added by local law number 33 for the year 2007, is amended by adding a new section 1509.10 to read as follows:\n1509.10. Anchorage for rooftop solar panels. The department shall develop, by rule, detailed criteria, including methods and materials, for the anchorage to roofs of solar photovoltaic and solar thermal panels, coverings and anchorage for other sustainable energy systems.  \n§4.
