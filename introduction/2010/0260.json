Chapter 2 of title 3 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 3-207.1 to read as follows:\n§3-207.1  Marriage notification. a. The city clerk shall prominently post the following information on the section(s) of the city clerk’s website, or any successor website maintained by or on behalf of the city clerk or a successor officer, relating to marriage, domestic partnerships or other similar subjects: (i) a list of all domestic and international jurisdictions that perform same sex marriages; and (ii) the following text: “Lawfully married individuals, including individuals in same sex marriages, are entitled to more New York State rights and benefits than those registered as domestic partners here in New York City. If an individual lawfully enters into a same sex marriage in a jurisdiction outside New York, they are entitled to most of the New York State rights and benefits available to people lawfully married in New York. If you are considering entering into a marriage in one of the jurisdictions listed above, it is recommended that you contact that jurisdiction beforehand in order to learn about any applicable marriage requirements or restrictions.”\nb. All information required to be made available on the internet pursuant to this local law shall also be prominently displayed and distributed free of charge in hard copy at the marriage bureau in the city clerk’s office.\nc. The obligations of the city clerk under this section shall be continuing and the city clerk shall make all reasonable efforts to ensure that all information provided pursuant to this section is accurate and current and shall update such information as appropriate.\n§ 2. This local law shall take effect thirty days after its enactment.\n \nMG\n6/10\nLS 1284",
