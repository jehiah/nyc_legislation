All proceedings of the commission and all documents and records in its possession shall be public records and the commission shall make an annual report to the city council on or before the second Monday of January in each year.  Such annual report shall contain information regarding complaints received by the commission from the public, including, but not limited to, complaints of overcharging, as well as enforcement actions undertaken by the commission, whether the enforcement action was dismissed or settled, or if a penalty was imposed by the commission on the subject of the enforcement action.  The information regarding enforcement actions shall include, but not be limited to, enforcement actions relating to illegal street hails, unlicensed vehicles, overcharging, and toll lane infractions.  The complaint and enforcement action information shall be disaggregated by the type of license held by the person or entity who is the subject of the complaint or action and the month during which the complaint was received or enforcement action undertaken.  Enforcement actions shall be further disaggregated by the subject matter of the action and geographic location. Complaint information shall be further disaggregated to the extent practicable by the subject matter of the complaint.  In addition to inclusion in the commission’s annual report, the disaggregated complaint and enforcement information shall be posted on the commission’s website updated no less than monthly.  Information shall be published in a manner that does not identify the individual parties involved in the actions reported upon in this section.  The chairman of the city council committee on [consumer affairs] transportation may at any time direct the commission or the chairman of the commission to appear before the committee to give testimony pertaining thereto, and to furnish to the members of the council any reports deemed necessary.\n\t§2.  This local law shall take effect sixty days after its enactment.\nPH\nLS # 1008\n6/1/10 - 11:45 pm",
