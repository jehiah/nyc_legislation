Information on any such lease shall be included until the lease terminates and information on sales of city-owned land shall be included for fifteen years following closing.  The report, other than for leases or sales of city-owned land, shall contain, for the [current reporting] prior fiscal year, the following information with respect thereto: (i) the project's name; (ii) its location; (iii) the time span over which the project is to receive any such assistance; (iv) the type of such assistance provided, including the name of the program or programs through which assistance is provided; (v) for projects that involve a maximum amount of assistance, a statement of the maximum amount of assistance available to those projects over the duration of the project agreement, and for those projects that do not have a maximum amount, the current estimated amount of assistance over the duration of the project agreement, the amount of tax exempt bonds issued during the current reporting year and the range of potential cost of those bonds; project assistance to be reported shall include, but shall not be limited to, PILOT savings, which shall be defined for the purposes of this paragraph as the difference between the PILOT payments made and the property tax that would have been paid in the absence of a PILOT agreement, the amount of mortgage recording fees waived, related property tax abatements, sales tax abatements, the dollar value of energy benefits and an estimated range of costs to the city of foregone income tax revenues due to the issuance of tax exempt bonds; (vi) the total number of employees at all sites covered by the project at the time of the project agreement including the number of permanent full-time jobs, the number of permanent part-time jobs, the number of full-time equivalents, and the number of contract employees where contract employees may be included for the purpose of determining compliance with job creation or retention requirements; (vii) the number of jobs that the entity receiving benefits is contractually obligated to retain and create over the life of the project, except that such information shall be reported on an annual basis for project agreements containing annual job retention or creation requirements, and, for each reporting year, the base employment level the entity receiving benefits agrees to retain over the life of the project agreement, any job creation scheduled to take place as a result of the project, and where applicable, any job creation targets for the current reporting year; (viii) the estimated amount, for that year and cumulatively to date, of retained or additional tax revenue derived from the project, excluding real property tax revenue other than revenue generated by property tax improvements; (ix) the amount of assistance received during the year covered by the report, the amount of assistance received since the beginning of the project period, and the present value of the future assistance estimated to be given for the duration of the project period; (x) for the current reporting year, the total actual number of employees at all sites covered by the project, including the number of permanent full-time jobs, the number of permanent part-time jobs, the number of contract jobs, and, for entities receiving benefits that employ two hundred fifty or more persons, the percentage of total employees within the \"exempt\" and \"non-exempt\" categories, respectively, as those terms are defined under the United States fair labor standards act, and for employees within the \"non-exempt\" category, the percentage of employees earning up to twenty-five thousand dollars per year, the percentage of employees earning more than twenty-five thousand per year up to forty-thousand dollars per year and the percentage of employees earning more than forty thousand dollars per year up to fifty thousand dollars per year; (xi) whether the employer offers health benefits to all full-time employees and to all part-time employees; (xii) for the current reporting year, with respect to the entity or entities receiving assistance and their affiliates, the number and percentage of employees at all sites covered by the project agreement who reside in the city of New York.

Such report shall include a statement explaining any delay in its submission past the statutory due date.
