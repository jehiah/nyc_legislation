Replacement shall be made with 2 1/2 to 6 inch caliper trees and/or directed by the department horticultural officer.

If replacement trees are to be planted by the person applying for the permit and are planted as directed by the department, then the department shall return such fee to such person upon completion of such planting.  In all other cases, the department shall retain such fee for purposes of planting replacement trees.\nc.
