Subchapter 21 of title 20 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 20-376.1, to read as follows:\n\tSection 20-376.1  Sound reproduction on open-air sight-seeing buses. a. Definitions.  For purposes of this section the following terms shall have the following meanings: \n(1) “Fleet” shall mean the total number of sight-seeing bus licenses issued to open-air sight-seeing buses that are held by one person.

The commissioner shall not issue a new license to any open-air sight-seeing bus that is not equipped with a headphone-limited sound reproduction system.  For purposes of this section, a new license is any license issued to a sight-seeing bus that is not a renewal.  \nc. Open-air sight-seeing buses shall be equipped with headphone-limited sound reproduction systems according to the following schedule:\n(1) By July 1, 2011 no less than ten percent of each fleet; \n(2) By July 1, 2012 no less than forty percent of each fleet; \n(3) By July 1, 2013  no less than sixty percent of each fleet; \n(4) By July 1, 2014 no less than eighty percent of each fleet; \n(5) By July 1, 2015, every open-air sight-seeing bus in each licensee’s fleet shall be equipped with a headphone-limited sound reproduction system. \nd.

The sight-seeing bus license holder of each fleet required to comply with this section shall provide annually to the department a list of buses that are equipped with the required sound equipment, in accordance with  rules promulgated by the commissioner. \ne.  Any sight-seeing bus license holder shall be subject to a fine of not less than $200  nor more than $750 per day for each open-air sight-seeing bus that is required to be equipped with a headphone- limited sound reproduction system in order for the fleet to be in compliance with the applicable percentages  set forth in paragraph c of this section and that is not so equipped. Additionally, the commissioner shall suspend the licenses of as many open-air sight-seeing buses as the number of such buses that are required to be equipped with a headphone-limited sound reproduction system as set forth in paragraph c of this section but that are not so equipped. Such suspension(s) shall continue until such time as compliance with paragraph c is complete.  \nf.
