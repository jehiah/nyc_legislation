A person who violates subdivision b of section 27-2029 of [article eight of subchapter two of] this chapter shall be subject to a civil penalty of twenty-five dollars per day from and including the date the notice is affixed pursuant to paragraph two of this subdivision until the date the violation is corrected but [no] not less than one thousand dollars. There shall be  a presumption that the condition constituting a violation continues after the affixing of the notice.\n§2.  Paragraph three of subdivision k of section 27-2115 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:  \n(3)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the owner shall be responsible for the correction of all violations placed pursuant to article eight of subchapter two of this code, but in an action for civil penalties pursuant to this article may in defense or mitigation of such owner's liability for civil penalties show:\n(i) That the condition which constitutes the violation did not exist at the time the violation was placed; or\n(ii)  That he or she began to correct the condition which constitutes the violation promptly upon discovering it but that full correction could  not be completed expeditiously because of technical difficulties, inability to obtain necessary materials, funds or labor, or inability to gain access to the dwelling unit wherein the violation occurs, or such other  portion of the building as might be necessary to make the repair; or\n(iii) That he or she was unable to obtain a permit or license necessary  to  correct  the violation, provided that diligent and prompt application was made therefor; or\n(iv) That the violation giving rise to the action was  caused  by  the act  or  negligence,  neglect  or  abuse of another not in the employ or subject to the direction of the owner­[.]; or \n(v) That in addition to any other defense or mitigation set forth in subparagraphs (i) through (iv) of this paragraph, with respect to an owner who may be subject to the penalty of not less than five hundred nor more than one thousand dollars per day with respect to a subsequent violation pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision, documentation of prompt and diligent efforts to correct the conditions that gave rise to an initial violation and that such conditions were corrected.

However, this defense or mitigation may not be asserted or demonstrated where the initial and subsequent violations occurred in the same calendar year or, in the case of violations of subdivision a of section 27-2029, during the same period of October first through May thirty-first. \n§3.  This local law shall take effect on October 1, 2011, except that the commissioner of housing preservation and development shall take such actions as are necessary for its implementation, including the promulgation of rules, prior to such effective date.\n\n\n2/22/2011 7:28 PM",
