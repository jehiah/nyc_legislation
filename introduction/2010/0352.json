  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection 1.  Legislative findings and intent.  The Council finds that our society needs energy sources to meet our demands that are sustainable, affordable and that contribute to energy independence.  Energy from the sun has the potential to meet our energy needs.  Solar energy is desirable because it is renewable, almost pollution free and would reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  By contrast, our current energy consumption patterns leave us vulnerable to energy instability and climate change.  \nThe Council further finds that renewable solar power can meet some of New York City’s energy needs, and that it is cleaner, cheaper, more sustainable and provides greater energy security.  Growth in the solar power industry is also expected to create many jobs in New York City because the City has adequate solar resources to aggressively pursue increased solar power installations.  Growth in the solar industry also has the potential to reduce energy costs over time.  However some existing Building Code provisions make it unduly burdensome to install solar power collection and generation systems now.  For example, the permit fee alone for street cranes needed to lift solar installation materials onto a roof to undertake solar energy system installation is four thousand dollars, significantly driving up the cost of installations. Therefore the Council finds that it is in the best interests of the City to remove this barrier and further incentivize installations of solar thermal and photovoltaic panels.\n§2.Section 28-112.6.3, of the Building Code, as added by local law number 33 for the year 2007, is amended by adding a new section 28-112.63.10 to read as follows:\n§ 28-112.6.3.10.Definitions. For purposes of this section the following terms shall have the following meanings:\n.a.. “Solar energy system installation” shall mean installation of a device or structural design feature that relies upon direct sunlight to provide interior lighting, or provide for the collection, storage and distribution of solar energy for space heating, cooling, electricity generation or water heating.  \n      \tb. No fee shall be required in connection with an application for a street crane permit for the installation on a roof of equipment related to a solar energy system.\n§3. This local law shall take effect ninety days from enactment and shall be applicable to any construction documents pending before the department of buildings on such effective date and the commissioner of buildings shall take such measures as are necessary for its implementation, including the promulgation of rules, prior to such effective date.\nLS # 6371 \nSS3/18/10  9:38a.m.",
