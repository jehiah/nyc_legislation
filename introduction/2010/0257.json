Such order shall be served personally upon the owner of such premises, or by leaving it with a person in control of the premises, or by leaving it or posting it at the place of business of the owner, or by leaving it or posting it at any home of such owner, if service to the place of business of such owner is impractical.\nd. Failure to comply with an order to remove an ATM booth within thirty days of the date of such order shall be a violation subject to a civil penalty of not less than two thousand five hundred dollars nor more than five thousand dollars for the first day of such violation.  Any owner who remains in violation beyond the first day after the expiration of the thirty-day period specified in such order shall be subject to a civil penalty of five thousand dollars for every five-day period during which he or she remains in violation.

The department shall be authorized to provide for the seizure of such ATM booth, after the owner has been provided with notice and an opportunity to be heard before the appropriate administrative tribunal, if the owner of such ATM booth has accumulated an aggregate of fifty thousand dollars in civil penalties that have remained unpaid for ninety days following the expiration of the time to appeal the imposition of such penalties in accordance with the procedures of the environmental control board.  \n\t§2. Subdivision a of section 19-150 is amended to read as follows:\n\t§19-150 Civil  penalties. a.

In the case of a continuing violation, each day's continuance shall be a separate and distinct offense, except that in the case of a violation of section 19-133.1, failure to remove an ATM booth pursuant to an order issued in accordance with subdivision c of section 19-133.1 shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than two thousand five hundred dollars nor greater than five thousand dollars for the first day of such violation and a civil penalty of five thousand dollars for every five days beyond the first day that such violation shall be in effect, and provided further that there shall be rebuttable presumption that the ATM booth has remained in place during each such five-day period.\n§3.
