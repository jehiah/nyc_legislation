Section 28-105.1 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by lettering such section as subdivision a and by adding new subdivisions b and c to read as follows:\nb. (1) The commissioner shall not issue to any applicant a permit for a property on which in the aggregate more than twenty-five thousand dollars is owed in (i) outstanding fines, civil penalties or judgments entered against such property by a court of competent jurisdiction or the environmental control board pursuant to chapter two of this title or chapter two of title twenty-seven of this code; (ii) fees or other charges lawfully assessed by the commissioner against such property; (iii) fees or liens related to repairs to such property performed by or on behalf of the department of housing preservation and development pursuant to section 27-2125, section 27-2127 or section 27-2153 of this code; (iv) tax arrears owed to the city with respect to such property and (v) unpaid water and sewage charges with respect to such property.\n(2) The commissioner shall not issue to any applicant a permit for a property where the owner of such property, including any partner or principal if the owner of the property is a corporation, partnership or other legal entity, owes in the aggregate for properties within the city more than twenty-five thousand dollars in (i) fines, civil penalties or judgments entered by a court of competent jurisdiction or the environmental control board pursuant to chapter two of this title or chapter two of title twenty-seven of this code; (ii) fees or other charges lawfully assessed by the commissioner; (iii) fees or liens related to repairs performed by or on behalf of the department of housing preservation and development pursuant to section 27-2125, section 27-2127 or section 27-2153 of this code; (iv) property tax arrears owed to the city with respect to any such property and (v) unpaid water and sewage charges with respect to any such property.

The department shall establish by rule a process to allow any applicant to challenge the denial of a request for a permit pursuant to subdivision b of this section.\n§2.
