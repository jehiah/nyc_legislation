  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\nSection 1. Legislative declaration.\nThe Council finds that acts of identity theft are plaguing New Yorkers.  Federal Trade Commission statistics indicate that identity theft is the single most common consumer fraud complaint in the nation.  Identity thieves are constantly developing new methods to harm consumers.  One disturbingly easy method of obtaining personal identifying and financial information involves “skimming,” or swiping an Automated Teller Machine (“ATM”) card or credit card in a device programmed to steal the data encoded in the card.  Skimming is often accomplished with a hand-held device or through an instrument installed in a seemingly innocuous ATM.  A significant cause of the problem is that, unlike bank-operated ATMs, private ATMs located in places such as grocery stores, nightclubs and gas stations are not adequately regulated by federal or state laws, and therefore are vulnerable to manipulation by unscrupulous machine operators or third parties.  In addition, because no permit is required for private ATMs, their operators are currently largely untraceable and law enforcement efforts to investigate potential sources of identity and monetary theft are severely handicapped.  A recent City Council investigation found that there are more than 1,500 unlicensed, unregistered and unregulated ATMs in New York City’s delicatessens and convenience stores alone, and that private ATMs can be leased for as little as $75 a month and purchased for as little as $1,000.\nThe Council finds that legislation requiring the registration of private ATMs, which are those leased to many businesses throughout the city but not adequately regulated by the state or federal government, would enable law enforcement to better monitor their use and would deter the manipulation of these machines by wrongdoers.  County governments in the New York City area have enacted similar legislation.\n§2. The administrative code of the City of New York is amended by adding a new subchapter 13 to chapter 4 of title 20 to read as follows:\nSUBCHAPTER 13\nAUTOMATED TELLER MACHINES\n§20-699.7  Definitions.\n§20-699.8  Registering private ATMs.\n§20-699.9  Terms; Applicable fees.\n§20-699.10 Requirements for registered ATMs. \n§20-699.11 Contracts between ATM distributors and operators.\n§20-699.12 Electronic fund transfers.\n§20-699.13 Exemptions.\n§20-699.14 Banking regulations.\n§20-699.15  Penalties. \n\n\n§20-699.7   Definitions.  Whenever used in this subchapter:\na. “ATM placement agreement” means any contract between a merchant and a private ATM provider, or between a merchant and distributor representing a private ATM operator, concerning the operation of a private ATM at a specified site, including the merchant’s place of business.  \nb. “Bank account” means any fund, account or other entity into which an individual may deposit money where it is governed by state and/or federal banking laws and exchange commission rules. \nc. “Consumer” or “customer” means a person or other entity conducting a transaction at a private ATM.\nd. “Distributor” means a person, other than a private ATM provider, who owns, invests in, or leases a private ATM, or enters into a private ATM placement agreement with a merchant and subsequently contracts with a private ATM provider to operate the private ATM.\ne. “EFT network” means one or more electronic funds transfer networks that are available to financial institutions, enabling the transfer of funds in and out of a patron’s bank account when the patron engages in a sale, return or similar monetary transaction.\nf. “Enforcing agent” means the Department of Consumer Affairs, the office of the New York State Attorney General, the District Attorney’s Office and the New York City Police Department.     \ng. “Financial institution” means a bank, savings association, credit union or any affiliate or subsidiary thereof, which is recognized as such by the federal Gramm-Leach Bliley Act of 1999 (12 U.S.C. sec. 1811). \nh. “Merchant” means an owner or lessee of the location or premises at which a private ATM is installed and made available to the merchant’s customers or invitees.  A merchant may own or lease a private ATM without being deemed a distributor, provided that the private ATM is intended solely for use at that merchant’s location or premises and is used at the location specified on the merchant’s application.\ni. “Monetary transaction” means accessing an account at a financial institution with a credit, debit or other bank card at a private ATM for the purpose of making cash withdrawals, balance inquiries, deposits, fund transfers between accounts, or any other account transaction.\nj. “Operating an ATM” means maintaining or providing the connection of a private ATM to any EFT network, regardless of who holds legal or equitable title in and to the private ATM.\nk. “Private Automated Teller Machine” (“private ATM”) means any device linked to the accounts and records of a banking institution that enables consumers to carry out banking transactions, including, but not limited to, account transfers, deposits, cash withdrawals, balance inquiries, and loan payments, that is not subject to federal or state banking regulations and that is not under the dominion and control of any federally or state chartered bank or lending institution, including, but not limited to, any trust company, savings bank, savings and loan association or credit union.\nl. “Private ATM provider” means any person, organization, firm, partnership or company offering a private ATM for public use.  This term shall not include any electronic funds transfer network or any federally or state chartered bank or lending institution.\nm.  “PIN” means personal identification number, a series of numbers that identifies the individual account card holder and permits use of the ATM machine.\nn.   “Sponsorship agreement” means any agreement between a financial institution and the private ATM provider that governs the operation of a private ATM within an EFT network.\n§20-699.8  Registering private ATMs.\na.  Every private ATM provider, distributor, or merchant operating a private ATM available for other than private use, and every private ATM in service, shall register with the department, except as otherwise provided by section 20-606 of this subchapter. \nb. If the private ATM provider or distributor is also registered with at least one EFT network through a sponsorship agreement with a financial institution that is a member of the EFT network, such EFT registration information shall accompany private ATM registration maintained with the department.  Every subsequent ATM registered with the department by an individual or business shall reference such sponsorship agreement, and shall contain any and all new information not presented with such prior registrations.\nc.  All registrations under this subchapter must contain all information as required by the department to effectuate and enforce the provisions herein.\nd.  Upon payment of the registration fee the commissioner shall issue a decal to the provider, distributor or merchant operating a private ATM to be securely affixed to a conspicuous and indispensable part of the ATM, on which shall be clearly set forth the registration number of the ATM and the date on which said registration expires. Such decal shall be of such material, form, design and dimension and set forth such distinguishing number or other identification marks as the commissioner shall prescribe. The commissioner upon renewal of the registration hereunder may continue the use of the decal for as many additional registration years as he or she in his or her discretion may determine, in which event he or she shall issue and deliver to the registeree a replaceable date tag as evidence of renewal of the registration, which shall be attached or affixed in such manner as he or she may prescribe by rule. The failure to affix or display such date tag in a manner prescribed by the commissioner shall constitute a violation of this section. In the event of the loss, mutilation or destruction of any decal or date tag issued hereunder, the owner may file such statement and proof of facts as the commissioner shall require, with a fee established by the department, and the department shall issue a duplicate or substitute decal or date tag.\ne.  Whenever a private ATM is moved from its current registered site to another location, the ATM provider must notify the department within five (5) business days of the change in location.\nf.  All private ATMs placed prior to the enactment of this law must submit the\nappropriate application, in the form prescribed by the commissioner, within ninety (90) days of the law’s effective date.\n\t§20-699.9  Terms; Applicable fees.\na.
