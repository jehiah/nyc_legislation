Paragraph a of subdivision 3 of section 11-245.3 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as last amended by local law number 68 for the year 2003, is hereby amended to read as follows: \n(a) if the income of the owner or the combined income of the owners of the property exceeds the sum of twenty-four thousand dollars for the income tax year immediately preceding the date of making application for exemption. Income tax year shall mean the twelve month period for which the owner or owners filed a federal personal income tax return, or if no such return is filed, the calendar year.

Such income shall include social security and retirement benefits, interest, dividends, total gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset which may be offset by a loss from the sale or exchange of a capital asset in the same income tax year, net rental income, salary or earnings, and net income from self-employment, but shall not include gifts, inheritances, [or] a return of capital, payments made to individuals because of their status as victims of Nazi persecution as defined in P.L. 103-286, monies earned through employment in the federal foster grandparent program, and veterans disability compensation[,] as defined in title 38 of the United States Code, and any such  income  shall  be  offset  by  all  medical  and prescription drug expenses actually  paid  which  were  not  reimbursed  or  paid  for  by insurance.
