The Council finds that there are environmentally preferable alternatives to the products that we commonly use for routine tasks, such as cleaning and maintaining interior building finishes.  Such alternatives are most beneficial to those who apply them and those who occupy buildings where such products are used. In addition to the federal government, a number of state and local jurisdictions have taken steps to purchase environmentally preferable or “green” cleaning products.\nThe Council finds that the purchase and use of many such environmentally preferable cleaning alternatives will result in improved indoor air quality and enhanced environmental health. \n§2. This law shall be known and may be cited as the “Greening Our Cleaning Act”.\n§3. Green cleaning product pilot program.  a.

For each product category included in the pilot program, the director shall establish health and environmental criteria for selecting products to be tested and evaluated in the pilot program.  The following may be considered in establishing such criteria:\n(1) any available scientific evidence;\n(2)\tany specifications, guidelines or rules of other governmental agencies or jurisdictions, \nor organizations supporting the establishment of environmental purchasing standards; \n(3)\twhether such products contain any known respiratory irritants, mutagens or \npetrochemical-based fragrances, are produced from bio-based materials, or are sold in containers that reduce worker exposure to the chemicals contained therein; and\n(4)\t any other matter determined by the director to be relevant to determining such health \nand environmental criteria. \n\te.
