Most volunteer ambulance companies include paramedics, and many offer advanced life support.  \nAccordingly, the Council declares it reasonable and necessary to require the Fire Department to provide resource and training assistance to New York City’s volunteer ambulance companies.\n§2. Chapter one of title 15 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new paragraph (3) to subdivision a of section 15-101 to read as follows:\n(3) “Volunteer ambulance service” shall mean a registered or certified volunteer ambulance service as such term is defined in section three thousand one of the public health law.\n§3. Chapter one of title 15 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 15-129 to read as follows:\n§15-129 Volunteer ambulance service. a. The department shall provide vehicle insurance and access to medical supplies for any volunteer ambulance service operating within the city of New York.\nb. The department shall provide ambulance driver training for any person who meets criteria established by the commissioner and wishes to become a driver for any volunteer ambulance service operating within the city of New York.\n§4 This local law shall take effect 90 days after its enactment into law.\n\n\nRBU\n03/09/05\nLS 2497",
