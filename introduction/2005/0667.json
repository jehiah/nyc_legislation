  "Summary": "",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\tSection 1. Section 26-404 of chapter 3 of title 26 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 40 for the year 1992, is amended to read as follows:\n ยง26-404 City rent agency; division of housing and community renewal. The division of housing and community renewal shall have charge of and conduct through its own counsel any proceeding under this chapter of the code, except for the provisions of subdivision m of section 26-405 and section 26-406 of this chapter which shall be under the jurisdiction of the department for the aging and such other agency as the mayor shall designate.\n\tยง2. Paragraph (7) of subdivision g of section 26-405 of such code is amended to read as follows:\n(7) A landlord demanding or collecting a rent adjustment pursuant to this subparagraph (n) shall at the time of either the demand or collection issue to the tenant either a rent bill or receipt separately setting forth the amount of the adjustment pursuant to this subparagraph (n) and the amount of the maximum rent otherwise demanded or collected. If the tenant has been issued a valid senior citizen rent exemption order or a valid disability rent exemption order, the owner shall also separately state the amount payable by the senior citizen or person with a disability after the exemption. \nยง3. The findings of subdivision m of section 26-405 of such code are amended to read as follows: \nm. Findings. The council finds that there is an acute and continuing housing shortage; that this shortage has and continues to have an adverse effect on the population and especially on inhabitants of the city who are sixty-two years of age or older and of limited means, as well as persons with disabilities, who cannot pay enough rent to induce private enterprise to maintain decent housing at rents they can afford to pay; that this condition is and continues to be particularly acute in a time of rising costs such as the present; that present rising costs and the continuing increase in rents pursuant to amendments to the New York city rent and rehabilitation law may result in such persons being unable to pay their rent, thus making them subject to eviction; that such hardships fall with particular severity upon older persons in the population, as well as persons with disabilities, because of their particular inability to find alternative accommodations within their means, because of the trauma experienced by many older persons, as well as persons with disabilities, who have to relocate and because they may endanger their health by paying additional sums for shelter and thereby deprive themselves of other necessities; that hardships imposed upon such people adversely affect their health and welfare and the general welfare of the inhabitants of the city. The council is aware of the provisions set forth in chapter three hundred seventy-two and chapter one thousand twelve of the laws of nineteen hundred seventy-one. It is our considered opinion that this legislation extending the rent exemption to cover the resultant rent increases due to the maximum rents established January first, nineteen hundred seventy-two, is not more stringent or restrictive than those presently in effect. It is [, therefore,] found and declared to be necessary for the health, welfare and safety of [such] persons who are sixty-two years of age or older, persons with disabilities and [of] inhabitants of the city that the city continue a system of special rent adjustments for such older persons, as well as extend such special rent adjustments to persons with disabilities as hereinafter provided.\nยง4. Subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of paragraph (2) of subdivision m of section 26-405 of such code, subparagraph (ii) as amended by local law number 67 for the year 2003, are amended to read as follows: \n(i) the head of the household residing in the housing accommodation is sixty-two years of age or older or is a person with a disability, and is entitled to the possession or to the use or occupancy of a dwelling unit. To qualify as a person with a disability for the purposes of this section, an individual shall submit to such agency as the mayor shall designate proof (as specified by regulation of such agency as the mayor shall designate) showing that such individual is  currently receiving social security disability insurance (SSDI) or supplemental security income (SSI) benefits under the federal social security act or disability pension or disability compensation benefits provided by the United States department of veterans affairs, or was previously eligible by virtue of receiving disability benefits under the supplemental security income program or the social security disability program and is currently receiving medical assistance benefits based on determination of disability as provided in section three hundred sixty-six of the social services law.\n(ii) The aggregate disposable income (as defined by regulation of the department for the aging) of all members of the household residing in the housing accommodation whose head of household is sixty-two years of age or older does not exceed twenty-four thousand dollars per year, after deduction of federal, state and city income and social security taxes. For purposes of this [subdivision] subparagraph, \"aggregate disposable income\" shall not include increases in benefits accorded pursuant to the social security act which take effect after the date of eligibility of a head of the household receiving benefits under this subdivision whether received by the head of the household or any other member of the household; [and]\nยง5. Subparagraph (iii) of paragraph (2) of subdivision m of section 26-405 of such code is renumbered as subparagraph (iv) and a new subparagraph (iii) is hereby added to read as follows: \n(iii)  the aggregate disposable income (as defined by regulation of such agency as the mayor shall designate) for the current income tax year of all members of the household residing in the housing accommodation whose head of the household is a person with a disability pursuant to this section does not exceed the maximum income above which such head of the household would not be eligible to receive cash supplemental security income benefits under federal law during such tax year. For purposes of this subparagraph, โaggregate disposable incomeโ shall not include increases in benefits accorded pursuant to the social security act which take effect after the date of eligibility of a head of the household receiving benefits under this subdivision whether received by the head of the household or any other member of the household.\nยง6. Subparagraph b of paragraph (3) of subdivision m of section 26-405 of such code as amended by local law number 40 for the year 1992, is amended to read as follows:\n \t(b) Each such order shall expire upon termination of occupancy of the housing accommodation by the tenant to whom it is issued. The landlord shall notify the department for the aging, in the case of a household whose eligibility for such order is based on the fact that the head of such household is sixty-two years of age or older, or such agency as the mayor shall designate, in the case of a household whose eligibility for such order is based on the fact that the head of such household is a person with a disability, on a form to be prescribed by such department, within thirty days of each such termination of occupancy.\nยง7. Paragraphs (5), (6), (8) and (9) of subdivision m of section 26-405 of such code, paragraph (5) as amended by local law number 67 for the year 2003, paragraph (6) as amended by local law number 40 for the year 1992, and paragraph (9) as amended by local law number 56 for the year 2003, are amended to read as follows:\n \t(5) A rent exemption order shall be issued to each tenant who applies to the New York City department for the aging or such other agency as the mayor shall designate in accordance with  [its] such department or agencyโs regulations and who is found to be eligible under this subdivision. Such order shall take effect on the first day of the first month after receipt of such application, except that where the aggregate disposable income of all members of the household residing in the housing accommodation whose head of the household is sixty-two years of age or older is greater than five thousand dollars per year but  does not   exceed   twenty-four thousand   dollars  per  year  pursuant  to subparagraph (ii) of paragraph two of subdivision m of this  section  on orders  issued  on  applications  received  before  July first, nineteen hundred seventy-five, the effective date of  such  order  shall  be  the later  of  (1)  June thirtieth, nineteen hundred seventy-four or (2) the last day of the month in which a person  becomes  an  eligible  head  of household  in  the housing accommodation in which such person resides at the time of filing the most recent  application  for  a  rent  exemption order;  and  further,  except  that where any other application has been received within ninety days of the issuance of the order increasing  the tenant's  maximum  rent  pursuant  to  paragraph  three,  four or six of subdivision (a) of this section, or subparagraph (a), (b), (c),  or  (l) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (g) of this section or pursuant to court order,  whichever  is  later,  the  rent  exemption  order shall without further order take effect  as  of  the  effective  date  of  said  order increasing  the  tenant's  rent  including  any  retroactive  increments collectible pursuant to such orders.\n(6) A rent exemption order shall be valid for a period of two years and may be renewed for further two year periods upon application by the tenant; provided, that upon any such renewal application being made by the tenant, any rent exemption order then in effect with respect to such tenant shall be deemed renewed until such time as the department for the aging or such other agency as the mayor shall designate shall have found such tenant to be either eligible or ineligible for a rent exemption order but in no event for more than six  additional months.  If such tenant is found eligible, the order shall be deemed to have taken effect upon expiration of the exemption. In the event that any such tenant shall, subsequent to any such automatic renewal, not be granted a rent exemption order, such tenant shall be liable to his or her landlord for the difference between the amounts he or she has paid under the provisions of the automatically renewed order and the amounts which he or she would have been required to pay in the absence of such order. Any rent exemption order issued pursuant to this  subdivision shall  include  provisions  giving  notice  as  to  the contents of this paragraph relating to automatic renewals of rent exemption  orders.  Any application or renewal application for a rent exemption order shall also constitute an application for a tax abatement under such section. The department for the aging and such other agency as the mayor shall designate may, with respect to renewal applications by tenants  [whom it has] who have been found eligible for rent exemption orders, prescribe a simplified form including a certification of the applicant's continued eligibility in lieu of a detailed statement of income and other qualifications.\n(8) Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter or chapter four of this title, when a dwelling unit is subject to regulation under this chapter or  chapter  four  of this title is reclassified by a city rent agency order subject to the other  chapter,  the  tenant,  who  holds  a senior  citizen  rent  increase  exemption  order  or disability rent increase exemption order at  the  time  of the reclassification or is otherwise eligible and entitled to  an  exemption order  from  one  or more rent increases but for the reclassification of the dwelling unit, may be issued a rent increase exemption  order  under the  chapter  to  which  the unit is thereafter subject by virtue of the reclassification continuing the previous exemption  notwithstanding  the reclassification  of  the  dwelling  unit  or,  where  no  previous rent increase exemption order has been  granted,  issuing  an  initial  order exempting  the  tenant  from  paying the rent increase to the extent for which he or she would have been eligible and entitled to be exempted  at the  time  of  the  increase  and  reclassification  but for the fact of reclassification of the dwelling unit including exemption from the  rent increase  granted  pursuant  to  subparagraph  (m)  of  paragraph one of subdivision g of this section to the extent that it  is  not  predicated upon  any  improvement  or  addition  in  a  category as provided for in subparagraph (d), (e),  (f),  (g),  (h)  or  (i)  of  paragraph  one  of subdivision  g  of  this  section.  Application  for  such rent increase exemption order shall be made  within  ninety  days  from  the  date  of reclassification  or  within  ninety  days of the effective date of this paragraph, whichever is later.

The council finds that there is an acute and continuing housing shortage; that this shortage has and continues to have an adverse effect on the population and especially on inhabitants of the city who are sixty-two years of age or older and of limited means, \\ul as well as persons with disabilities,\\ulnone  who cannot pay enough rent to induce private enterprise to maintain decent housing at rents they can afford to pay; that this condition is and continues to be particularly acute in a time of rising costs such as the present; that present rising costs and the continuing increase in rents pursuant to amendments to the New York city rent and rehabilitation law may result in such persons being unable to pay their rent, thus making them subject to eviction; that such hardships fall with particular severity upon older persons in the population\\ul , as well as persons with disabilities,\\ulnone  because of their particular inability to find alternative accommodations within their means, because of the trauma experienced by many older persons\\ul , as well as persons with disabilities,\\ulnone  who have to relocate and because they may endanger their health by paying additional sums for shelter and thereby deprive themselves of other necessities; that hardships imposed upon such people adversely affect their health and welfare and the general welfare of the inhabitants of the city. The council is aware of the provisions set forth in chapter three hundred seventy-two and chapter one thousand twelve of the laws of nineteen hundred seventy-one. It is our considered opinion that this legislation extending the rent exemption to cover the resultant rent increases due to the maximum rents established January first, nineteen hundred seventy-two, is not more stringent or restrictive than those presently in effect. It is [, therefore,] found and declared to be necessary for the health, welfare and safety of [such] persons \\ul who are sixty-two years of age or older, persons with disabilities\\ulnone  and [of] inhabitants of the city that the city continue a system of special rent adjustments for such \\ul older\\ulnone  persons\\ul , as well as extend such special rent adjustments to persons with disabilities\\ulnone  as hereinafter provided.\\par\n\\f1\\'81\\'98\\f0 4.
