  "Text": "Be it enacted as by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection 1.  Legislative Intent and Findings\n\n\tThe Council hereby finds and declares that in order to ensure public safety for millions of subway commuters, it is necessary to equip all first responders including police officers, firefighters, emergency medical technicians and private ambulance paramedics with a Metrocard for easy access to the subway system in the event of an emergency.\n\tOn Saturday, February 19, 2005, 26-year-old German Cabrera was shot on the subway platform at the West 18th Street IRT station in Chelsea.   Police officers responding to the incident were delayed in reaching the victim because they had no Metrocards to pass through the revolving high-wheel turnstiles.  The paramedics that arrived were also in a similar predicament as they too were without a Metrocard and had to be swiped in by a rider.\nIn these instances, of course, a working MetroCard proves to be just as important a tool to a police officer and paramedic as a pistol and bullet-resistant vest or a defibrillator. \n\tIt is not the intent of the Council to infringe upon these agencies’ authority over assigning operational equipment.  However, in light of the possible closing of 164 subway booths and the reported increase in violent incidents in the subway system, as well as impediments such as high-wheel turnstiles, the Council finds it necessary to adopt legislation that would make certain that all first responders have access to the transit system without difficulty.\n§2. Chapter 1 of title 10 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to add a new section 10-164, to read as follows:\n§ 10-164. Issuance of Metrocards to first responders \na. Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following terms shall have the following meanings:\n1.\t“First responder” shall mean any member of the Police Department, Fire Department,\nEmergency Medical Service or employee of a private ambulance company that contracts with the Fire Department to provide E911 services, or any other city employee who is responsible for immediately responding to an emergency incident.\n2.\t“Metrocard” shall refer to the magnetic strip access cards used to gain entry to the city’s subway stations by swiping through the turnstiles.  \nb.  Issuance of Metrocards \n1. The city shall issue every first responder a Metrocard as a standard piece of equipment. \n§3. This local law shall take effect ninety days after its enactment. \n\nLS#2507\n02-25-05",
