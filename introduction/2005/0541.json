  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows: \n \tSection 1. Declaration of legislative findings and intent.  The Council hereby finds and declares that people with clinical/symptomatic HIV disease and AIDS who seek assistance from the department of AIDS services and income support or its legal or functional equivalent (the “division”), have particularly acute needs for the timely receipt of benefits and services, intensive case management, and safe, clean housing to keep them healthy.  The Council further finds that having accurate information regarding the division’s success in providing timely access to benefits and services, intensive case management and safe housing is critical to accomplishing its charter mandated oversight role with respect to the division.  The Council hereby aims to ensure the gathering and reporting of information crucial to determining compliance with the legal mandates imposed on the division.   \n§2. Section 21-128 of chapter one of title 21 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:  \n§21-128.  Benefits and services to be provided to persons with clinical/symptomatic HIV illness or with AIDS. \na. Whenever used in this section, the following terms shall be defined as follows:\n* * * \n\t2.   “Completed application” means: \n(a) the date on the client’s receipt indicating that the application is complete pursuant to paragraph 2 of subdivision c of this section; or \n(b) where no receipt is provided, the date on which the client has provided the division with all of the information and documentation necessary to complete the client’s application for a benefit or service; or  \n(c) in the case of a separate determination of eligibility for medicaid or food stamps, the date on which a person’s application for public assistance was denied or a recipient’s public assistance case was closed. \n[2]3. \"Division\" shall mean the division of AIDS services as established pursuant to § 21-126 of this chapter, or its functional or legal equivalent;\n [3]4. \"Eligible person\" shall mean a person who satisfies the eligibility requirements established pursuant to applicable local, state or federal statute, law, regulation or rule for the benefits and services set forth in subdivision b of this section or for any other benefits and services deemed appropriate by the commissioner;\n5. “Immediate needs grant” means a pre-investigation grant provided to a person who appears to be in immediate need; \n6. “Legally mandated time frame” means the time period within which a benefit or service must be provided to an eligible applicant under federal, state or local law, rule, regulation or by order of a court of competent jurisdiction; \n[4]7.  \"Medically appropriate transitional and permanent housing\" shall mean housing which is suitable for persons with severely compromised immune systems, and if necessary, accessible to persons with disabilities as defined in section 8-102 of this code. Such housing shall include, but not be limited to, individual refrigerated food and medicine storage and adequate bathroom facilities which shall, at a minimum, provide an effective locking mechanism and any other such measures as are necessary to ensure privacy; \n8.  “Non-emergency housing” shall mean housing provided or administered by the division, including but not limited to programs referred to as scatter site I housing, scatter site II housing and congregate housing; \n[5]9.  \"Person with clinical/symptomatic HIV illness or with AIDS\" shall mean a person who has at any time been diagnosed with clinical/symptomatic HIV illness, as determined by the New York state department of health AIDS institute, or a person with AIDS, as defined by the federal centers for disease control and prevention; \n10.  “Processing time for applications for benefits or services” means the length of time required to process an application for benefits or services administered by the division, which shall not be represented in terms of averages, but shall be reported in terms of categories covering various periods of time as follows: \n(a) for non-emergency applications for food stamps, medicaid and public assistance benefits:  0 to 15 days; 16 to 30 days; 31 to 45 days; 46 to 65 days; 66 to 75 days; and more than 76 days;\n(b) for immediate needs grants and expedited food stamps: same day; 1 to 5 days; 6 to 10 days; 11 to 17 days; and more than 18 days;\n(c) for all other non-emergency benefits and services, including but not limited to exceptions to policy for enhanced rental assistance and additional allowances:  0 to 15 days; 16 to 30 days; 31 to 45 days; 46 to 75 days; and more than 76 days; \n(d) for all other benefits and services provided on an emergency basis, including benefits and services currently referred to as “emergency CBCFAs”: (i) in reporting the time frame from completed application to approval or denial: 0 to 2 days; 3-5 days; 6-10 days; 11-15 days; and more than 16 days; and (ii) in reporting the time frame from approval to provision of the benefit: 0-1 days; 2-5 days; 6-10 days; 11-15 days; and more than 16 days; and \n(e) for applications for non-emergency housing: 0 to 15 days; 16 to 30 days; 31 to 45 days; 46 to 75 days; 76 to 100 days; and more than 100 days.    \n11.  “Separate determination of eligibility for medicaid or food stamps” means a determination regarding eligibility for medicaid or food stamps made either when a person’s application for public assistance has been denied or when a recipient’s public assistance case is closed. \n§3.
