  "Summary": "",
  "TextID": 33897,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection 1.  Legislative findings and intent.  In October of 1972, the United States Congress established the Gateway National Recreation Area (“Gateway”) as part of an effort to bring the National Park System and its ethic of preserving and protecting outstanding resources closer to major urban areas.\nGateway encompasses the largest collection of natural systems, wildlife habitats, historic resources, and recreational opportunities in the New York City/New Jersey metropolitan area.  It also encompasses numerous sites of critical natural and cultural importance to the health of local ecosystems, to the life of migratory and native species and to the military, navigational and aviation history of the region and the nation, especially in the context of attendant defenses of New York Harbor.\nAccording to the National Park Service (NPS), Gateway is the only extensive public natural area in the New York City region.  The Jamaica Bay Unit is one of several units, consisting of lands, waters, marshes and submerged lands, comprising Gateway.  The Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge (“Refuge”), established by the City of New York in 1948, is located within the Jamaica Bay Unit.  The Refuge, a State and nationally recognized important bird area, encompasses 2,500 acres within the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens.  The only wildlife refuge in the National Park System, it provides a shelter for rare and endangered birds and a variety of habitats for more than 325 kinds of waterfront and shorebirds.  It is also a critical stop-over area along the Eastern Flyway migration route and is one of the best and world renowned bird-watching locations in the western hemisphere.\nJamaica Bay is one of the largest and most productive coastal ecosystems in the State of New York, as well as within the Northeastern United States, and is an important recreational destination for local, national and international visitors.  It contains approximately 13,000 acres of surface waters, including the largest tidal wetland complex in New York State.  These wetlands provide benefits such as natural water quality improvement, flood protection and shoreline erosion control for the commercial and residential areas in and around the Bay in Brooklyn and Queens.  Unfortunately, construction and development within the Jamaica Bay watershed has often been conducted without consideration of potential adverse impacts on the Bay and sometimes without notice to all interested governmental agencies, civic groups and other interested parties.  One such governmental agency is the NPS, which is the primary steward of the Bay, itself, and with whom, among many other agencies, it is critical for the City to collaborate in order to protect the Bay.\nJamaica Bay’s future as an oasis of great ecological importance is in severe jeopardy due to the fact that thousands of acres of the Bay’s marshy islands, which serve as nesting and feeding areas for an abundance of birds and other wildlife, are rapidly and mysteriously vanishing.  Scientists predict that the Jamaica Bay marshlands will completely vanish in less than twenty years if the cause of their deterioration and a solution to their preservation are not found.  \nThis legislation would require the New York City Department of Environmental Protection to create a watershed protection plan for the watershed/sewershed of Jamaica Bay, and would create a Jamaica Bay watershed protection plan advisory committee. The Council finds that such watershed planning is vital to the future of Jamaica Bay.  This legislation establishes the initial pathway towards restoring and maintaining the water quality and ecological integrity of the Bay by  comprehensively assessing threats to the Bay and coordinating environmental remediation and protection efforts in a focused and cost-effective manner.  Watershed protection planning for Jamaica Bay is an efficient and effective means of promoting the sustainability of the Bay’s environment, the economy associated with the Bay, and the linkages between the two.\n§2. Chapter five of title 24 of the administrative code of the city of New York is hereby amended by adding thereto a new section 24-527 to read as follows: \n§24-527 Watershed protection plan for the watershed/sewershed of Jamaica bay.  a. No later than September 1, 2006, the commissioner shall complete a watershed protection plan for the watershed/sewershed of Jamaica bay, which shall, among other things, include measures the city can implement to help protect Jamaica bay.

Legislative findings and intent.  In October of 1972, the United States Congress established the Gateway National Recreation Area (\\ldblquote Gateway\\rdblquote ) as part of an effort to bring the National Park System and its ethic of preserving and protecting outstanding resources closer to major urban areas.\\par\n\\pard\\fi720\\sl480\\slmult1\\qj Gateway encompasses the largest collection of natural systems, wildlife habitats, historic resources, and recreational opportunities in the New York City/New Jersey metropolitan area.  It also encompasses numerous sites of critical natural and cultural importance to the health of local ecosystems, to the life of migratory and native species and to the military, navigational and aviation history of the region and the nation, especially in the context of attendant defenses of New York Harbor.\\par\nAccording to the National Park Service (NPS), Gateway is the only extensive public natural area in the New York City region.  The Jamaica Bay Unit is one of several units, consisting of lands, waters, marshes and submerged lands, comprising Gateway.  The Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge (\\ldblquote Refuge\\rdblquote ), established by the City of New York in 1948, is located within the Jamaica Bay Unit.  The Refuge, a State and nationally recognized important bird area, encompasses 2,500 acres within the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens.  The only wildlife refuge in the National Park System, it provides a shelter for rare and endangered birds and a variety of habitats for more than 325 kinds of waterfront and shorebirds.  It is also a critical stop-over area along the Eastern Flyway migration route and is one of the best and world renowned bird-watching locations in the western hemisphere.\\par\nJamaica Bay is one of the largest and most productive coastal ecosystems in the State of New York, as well as within the Northeastern United States, and is an important recreational destination for local, national and international visitors.  It contains approximately 13,000 acres of surface waters, including the largest tidal wetland complex in New York State.  These wetlands provide benefits such as natural water quality improvement, flood protection and shoreline erosion control for the commercial and residential areas in and around the Bay in Brooklyn and Queens.  Unfortunately, construction and development within the Jamaica Bay watershed has often been conducted without consideration of potential adverse impacts on the Bay and sometimes without notice to all interested governmental agencies, civic groups and other interested parties.  One such governmental agency is the NPS, which is the primary steward of the Bay, itself, and with whom, among many other agencies, it is critical for the City to collaborate in order to protect the Bay.\\par\nJamaica Bay\\rquote s future as an oasis of great ecological importance is in severe jeopardy due to the fact that thousands of acres of the Bay\\rquote s marshy islands, which serve as nesting and feeding areas for an abundance of birds and other wildlife, are rapidly and mysteriously vanishing.  Scientists predict that the Jamaica Bay marshlands will completely vanish in less than twenty years if the cause of their deterioration and a solution to their preservation are not found.  \\par\nThis legislation would require the New York City Department of Environmental Protection to create a watershed protection plan for the watershed/sewershed of Jamaica Bay, and would create a Jamaica Bay watershed protection plan advisory committee. The Council finds that such watershed planning is vital to the future of Jamaica Bay.  This legislation establishes the initial pathway towards restoring and maintaining the water quality and ecological integrity of the Bay by  comprehensively assessing threats to the Bay and coordinating environmental remediation and protection efforts in a focused and cost-effective manner.  Watershed protection planning for Jamaica Bay is an efficient and effective means of promoting the sustainability of the Bay\\rquote s environment, the economy associated with the Bay, and the linkages between the two.\\par\n\\'a72. Chapter five of title 24 of the administrative code of the city of New York is hereby amended by adding thereto a new section 24-527 to read as follows: \\par\n\\ul\\'a724-527 Watershed protection plan for the watershed/sewershed of Jamaica bay.  a.
