  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection 1.  Declaration of legislative findings and intent.  The Council of the City of New York hereby finds that use of alternative fuel vehicles is important to the City’s goal of improving air quality and conserving fuel.  The use of alternative fuel vehicles is especially appropriate with taxicabs, many of which operate 24 hours per day, spewing an enormous amount of emissions into the air.\n\tThe burning of fossil fuels is a major source of greenhouse gases that contribute to the growing problem of global warming.  Furthermore, fuel prices continue to escalate while our reliance on fossil fuels has also increased our dependence on foreign sources of oil.  Therefore, it is important to encourage the use and development of alternative fuel vehicles, including hybrid electric vehicles, to increase fuel efficiency, reduce air pollution and lower our dependence on foreign oil.  \n\tThe New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission has promulgated rules mandating specifications for taxicabs.  These specifications, while important to passenger comfort, have prevented many promising alternative fuel vehicles, which do not meet specifications by minimal amounts, from being used as taxicabs.  To further the City’s policy of improving air quality and conserving fuel, this Council is enacting this law to designate certain alternative fuel vehicles to be used as taxicabs.  \n§2\tChapter 5 of title 19 of the administrative code of the city of New York is hereby amended by enacting a new section 19-533 to read as follows: \n19-533   Clean air taxis.  The commission shall approve one or more hybrid electric vehicle models for use as a taxicab within ninety days after the enactment of this law.  The approved vehicle model or models shall be eligible for immediate use by all current and future medallion owners, including successful bidders for medallions sold pursuant to local law number 51 for the year 2003.  For the purposes of this law, a hybrid electric vehicle shall be defined as a commercially available mass production vehicle originally equipped by the manufacturer with a combustion engine system together with an electric propulsion system that operates in an integrated manner.\n§ 3.  This local law shall take effect immediately after its enactment into law.\n\nPH\n6.22.05",
