According to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, nearly two-thirds of U.S. adults are overweight, and one-third are obese.  Overweight and obesity are know risk factors for numerous illnesses, including diabetes, heart disease, stroke, hypertension, gallbladder disease, osteoarthritis, breathing problems and some forms of cancer.  As a result, overweight people have greater health care needs than the general population.  \n\tNew York City ambulance service, however, may not be sufficiently prepared to assist morbidly obese New Yorkers.  Anecdotal evidence indicates that the Fire Department has been unable to provide proper emergency medical transport to this population.  \n\tAccordingly, the Council declares it reasonable and necessary to require the Fire Department to have sufficient equipment and training to provide emergency medical transport to the morbidly obese.\n§ 2. Chapter one of title 15 is amended by adding a new section 15-129 to read as follows:\n\t§ 15-129. Ambulance transport capability for the morbidly obese. At least two ambulances shall be located in each borough with proper equipment and emergency medical technicians trained to transport a person of 500 pounds or more.\n§ 3.
