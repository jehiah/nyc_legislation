  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\tSection 1. Statement of findings and purpose.  In almost every category of goods, there are some products that are environmentally preferable to others.  In many instances, there is little or no additional cost associated with the environmentally preferable option.  For example, there is little cost difference between paper with no recycled content and paper with thirty percent post-consumer recycled content.  Similarly, environmentally preferable indoor paints are readily available from all major paint manufacturers.\n\tMany levels of government have established environmental purchasing programs.  The federal government, for example, requires all federal agencies, subject to price and other considerations, to purchase goods with a minimum percentage of recovered material according to guidelines developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.  In addition, federal agencies are required by Executive Order 13101 and the Federal Acquisition Regulation to assess and give preference to those products and services that are environmentally preferable.  States such as California, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio and Pennsylvania have also developed extensive environmental procurement programs, as have many local governments.  Environmental purchasing programs take into account numerous factors, including the production of waste, energy and water use, greenhouse gas emissions, indoor air quality, recycled and reused content and the presence of hazardous substances.  \nThe Council finds that the purchase of environmentally preferable products will protect the environment by reducing the City’s energy consumption, air pollution, hazardous releases and water use.  Accordingly, the Council declares it is reasonable and necessary to require the establishment of a citywide director of environmental purchasing.\n§2. The administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new chapter 3 to title 6 to read as follows:\nCHAPTER 3\nENVIRONMENTAL PURCHASING\nSUBCHAPTER 1\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\n§6-301\t\tDefinitions.\n\t§6-302 \t\tApplicability. \n\t§6-303\t\tExemptions and waivers.\n\t§6-301 Definitions. a.
