  "Summary": "",
  "TextID": 33101,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\nSection 1. Declaration of Legislative Intent and Findings.\n\nAccording to the New York City Department of City Planning, New York City is home to 1,361,007 non-citizens of voting age who contribute in countless ways to the economic, social and cultural vitality of our city, but are not allowed to directly participate in choosing the municipal representatives who make the policies that affect their daily lives. These city residents are subject to all the laws that citizens must observe. The fact that nearly one out of five New Yorkers of voting age cannot vote undermines the health of our local democracy.\nLocal voting affirms the hallowed principle of the American Revolution: \"no taxation without representation.\" Immigrants pay 15.5% of the state's income tax or $18.2 billion in taxes annually.  Our Founding Fathers believed that immigrant suffrage was a way to give newcomers a stake in the emerging American democracy.  Until 1804, New York State allowed non-citizen immigrants to vote in federal, state and local elections. Indeed, for most of this country's history-from 1770s to 1920s-twenty-two states and federal territories permitted non-citizen residents to vote in local, state and federal elections, and to hold public offices such as alderman, coroner and school board member.\n\nFor every disempowered group in America's history, voting rights have been a vital tool for acquiring economic, social and civil rights and for expanding democracy. For African-Americans, women, and young men who were expected to go to war at 18 but were not yet allowed to vote, breaking down legal barriers to voting was a crucial point in the struggle for equality. Recognizing the importance of voting, the leaders of the Civil Rights Movement succeeded in banishing poll taxes and literacy tests. In 1971, the voting age was lowered to 18.\n\tNevertheless, an alarmingly large part of New York City’s population remains disenfranchised.\nExpanding the franchise is a rational and practical way to unite all members of our society toward a common goal of making New York City a better place. It acknowledges people’s membership in their communities and gives them a way to be actively engaged in improving their neighborhood. Far from being a substitute for citizenship, allowing the newest New Yorkers to vote is the best way to promote civic education and participation. \nThe administration of this process is not only possible, but we have experience doing it here in New York City.   All immigrants living in New York City - including undocumented immigrants - who had children in public schools could vote in school board elections from 1970 until 2003, when the school boards were eliminated. \nIt is the intent of this Council that adequate information and resources that are culturally and linguistically competent be provided to the direct beneficiaries of this Chapter in order to prevent unintended noncompliance or violations of this law.  Further, it is the intent of this Council that unintended violations of this Chapter will not negatively affect an individual’s immigration status or naturalization efforts.\nNew York, home of the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, symbolizes America's past and future as an immigrant nation. It is only appropriate for New York City to restore voting to non-citizen residents in municipal elections, expanding our democracy and setting an example fitting for a city created by immigrants.\n\t§2. The New York City charter is amended by adding a new chapter forty-six-A, to read as follows:\nChapter 46-A\nCITY ELECTIONS\nVoting By Non-Citizen Residents\n§1060 Definitions.\n§1061 Register To Vote.\n§1062 The role of the New York City Board of Elections.  \n§1063 Poll Administration.\n§1064 Municipal Voter Registration Forms.\n§1065 Party affiliations.  \n§1066 Availability of Municipal Voter Registration Forms.\n§1067 Absentee Ballots.  \n§1068 Registration deadlines.\n§1069 Municipal Voter Notification.\n§1070 Change of Address Procedures.  \n§1071 Confidentiality.\n§1072 Language Access.  \n§1073 Community Participation.  \n§1074 Transitioning to citizenship.  \n§1075 Challenges.\n§1076 State or federal elections.  \n§1077 Violations of this chapter.  \n\n§1060 Definitions.

I\nunderstand that if it is not true I can be convicted and fined up to $500 and/or jailed for up to one year.\n8.\tWhich form of affirmation shall be followed by a space for the date and the aforementioned line for the applicant’s signature.\n\n§1065 Party affiliations.  Individuals who enroll in a political party on municipal voter registration forms shall be considered qualified members of that party for the purposes of primary elections and candidate nomination processes, including, but not limited to petitioning and fundraising. \n§1066 Availability of Municipal Voter Registration Forms.

The New York City Board of Elections shall create and distribute a municipal voter notification system consistent with New York state election law. \n§1070 Change of Address Procedures.  The New York City Board of Elections shall create a process, consistent with that used by the New York State Board of Elections for citizen voters, by which a municipal voter can change or update his or her address.  \n§1071 Confidentiality. \na. No potential Municipal Voter will be asked about the specifics of his or her immigration status, other than whether or not he or she qualifies to vote under this provision.  If that information is volunteered to any City employee, it will not be recorded or shared with any other federal, state, or local agency, except as required by law.\nb. All federal, state, and municipal confidentiality policies that pertain to citizen voters shall similarly apply to Municipal Voters. \nc.

You do further declare that you are aware that it is a crime to make any false statement. That all the statements you have made to the board have been true and that you understand that a false statement is perjury and you will be guilty of a misdemeanor.” \n§1076 State or federal elections.  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to confer upon non-citizens the right to vote for any state or federal office or on any state or federal ballot question.  \n§1077 Violations of this chapter.  \na.\tAny person who knowingly and willfully violates any provision of this chapter, is guilty of a misdemeanor.\nb.\tA public officer who knowingly and willfully omits, refuses or neglects to perform any act required of him by this chapter or who knowingly and willfully refuses to permit the doing of any act authorized by this chapter or who knowingly and willfully hinders or delays or attempts to hinder or delay the performance of such an act is, if not otherwise provided by § 17-128 of the election law or any other law, is guilty of a misdemeanor.\nc.\tAny person convicted of a misdemeanor under this section shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than one year, or by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars or more than five hundred dollars, or both such fine and imprisonment.\n\n§3. Severability.  If any subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or other portion of this chapter is, for any reason, declared unconstitutional or invalid, in whole or in part, by any court of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed severable and such unconstitutionality or invalidity shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of the local law that added this section, which remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect.  \n§4. This local law shall become effective 180 days after its enactment.\n\n\n\nDS\n4/15/05",
