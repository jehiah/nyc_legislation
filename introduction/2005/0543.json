The Council hereby finds and declares that people with clinical/symptomatic HIV disease and AIDS who seek assistance from New York City’s Human Resources Administration (“HRA”) have particularly acute needs for safe, clean non-emergency housing to keep them healthy.  The Council further finds that the lack of a comprehensive housing referral and tracking system creates greater challenges for providing non-emergency housing of the quality HRA’s clients with clinical/symptomatic HIV disease and AIDS require.  The Council hereby aims to ensure higher quality housing for all HRA clients with clinical/symptomatic HIV disease and AIDS.    \n§ 2. Section 21-128 of chapter one of title 21 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended as follows:\n§ 21-128.  l. Centralized housing referral and placement system.  \n(1) Development and maintenance of referral and placement system.  Within one year of the effective date of the local law that added this subdivision, the commissioner shall establish and maintain a housing referral and placement system to track referrals to and placements in emergency and non-emergency housing and to track the conditions at emergency facilities at which clients with clinical/symptomatic HIV illness or with AIDS reside.  At a minimum, the housing referral and placement system required by this subdivision shall have: (i) a mechanism to track vacancies at non-emergency housing facilities and to match eligible applicants to appropriate vacancies; (ii) a mechanism to track conditions at emergency housing facilities; and (iii) a mechanism to track the outcome of referrals and length of stay at emergency housing facilities and non-emergency housing facilities.\n§ 3.
