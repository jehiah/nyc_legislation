  "TextID": 33170,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\nSection 1. Legislative findings and intent. The city of New York engages in annual disbursements of billions of dollars in public funds through one of the largest budgets in the United States, and is, therefore, desirous of preventing the payment of fraudulent claims by the city at taxpayers’ expense. Compensation by the city of claims that are false or fraudulent has a considerable impact upon the city’s treasury through the loss of untold amounts of public dollars. \nThe federal false claims act provides an excellent model for combating fraud by government contractors and other parties. Since the federal false claims act was substantially amended in 1986, the federal government has recovered billions of dollars under the act.  Additionally, a number of states have enacted civil false claims statutes of their own in order to impede fraud in state programs and to protect state treasuries.\nThe Council therefore finds that the city of New York should enact legislation modeled on the federal false claims act, to enhance the city’s ability to recover monetary damages from parties who file fraudulent claims for payment of city funds and to recover the substantial costs that are incurred in protecting the taxpayers against such fraud.\n§2. Title 7 of the administrative code of the city of New York is hereby amended by adding a new chapter 8 to read as follows:\nCHAPTER  8\nNEW YORK CITY FALSE CLAIMS ACT\n§7-801.\tShort title.\n§7-802.\tDefinitions.\n§7-803.\tFalse claims.\n§7-804.\tCivil actions for false claims.\n§7-805.\tRemedies of employees.\n§7-806.\tLimitation of actions; burden of proof.  \n§7-807.\tOther law enforcement authority and duties.\n§7-808.\tAnnual report\n§7-809.\tComptroller.\n§7-810.\tRegulations.\n§7-801. Short title. This chapter shall be known as the \"New York city false claims act.\"\n§7-802. Definitions. For purposes of this chapter, the following terms shall mean:\n1. “City” means the city of New York, and any city agency, department, division or bureau, and any board, committee, institution, agency of government, local development corporation or public benefit corporation, the majority of whose members are appointed by city officials.\n2. “Civil enforcement action” means a legal action brought pursuant to section 7-804 of this chapter for the commission of any act or acts described in subdivision b of section 7-803 of this chapter.\n3. “Claim” means any request or demand, whether under a contract or otherwise, for money or property which is made to any employee, officer, or agent of the city, or to any contractor, grantee or other recipient, if the city provides the money or property which is requested or demanded or will reimburse such contractor, grantee or other recipient for the money or property which is requested or demanded.  “Claim” also encompasses any record or statement used in presenting an obligation to pay or transmit money or property either directly or indirectly to the city.\n4. “False claim” means any claim, or information relating to a claim, which is false or fraudulent.\n5. “Knowing” and “knowingly” mean that with respect to information, a person: (i) has actual knowledge of the falsity of the information, or (ii) acts in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the information, or (iii) acts in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information.  Proof of specific intent to defraud is not required.\n6. “Person” means any natural person, corporation, partnership, firm, organization, association or other legal entity or individual, other than the city.\n7.  “State” means the state of New York and any state department, agency, board, bureau, division, commission, committee, public benefit corporation, public authority, council, office or other governmental or proprietary function for the state.\n§7-803. False claims. a.  Any person who: \n1. knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, to any city officer or employee, a false claim for payment or approval by the city; \n2. knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement to get a false claim paid or approved by the city; \n3. conspires to defraud the city by getting a false claim allowed or paid by the city; \n4. has possession, custody, or control of property or money used, or to be used, directly or indirectly, by the city and, intending to defraud the city or willfully conceal the property or money, delivers, or causes to be delivered, less property or money than the amount for which the person receives a certificate or receipt; \n5. is authorized to make or deliver a document certifying receipt of property used, or to be used, directly or indirectly, by the city and, intending to defraud the city, makes or delivers the receipt without completely knowing that the information on the receipt is true; \n6. knowingly buys, or receives as a pledge of an obligation or debt, public property from an officer or employee of the city knowing that such officer or employee lawfully may not sell or pledge the property; or\n7. knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement to conceal, avoid, or decrease, directly or indirectly, an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the city;\nshall be liable to the city for three times the amount of damages which the city sustains because of the act or acts of such person, and a civil penalty of between five thousand and fifteen thousand dollars for each violation of this section, except that any party to a civil enforcement action commenced may request the court to assess, and the court may agree to so assess, not more than two times the amount of damages sustained because of the act or acts of such person if all of the following circumstances are found:\n(i) The person committing the violation of section 7-803 of this chapter had furnished all information known to such person about such act or acts to (a) the commissioner of investigation or (b) the corporation counsel or a city agency head, who shall refer such information to the commissioner of investigation, and has furnished such information within thirty days of the date on which such person first obtained the information;\n(ii). such person fully cooperated with any government investigation of such violation; and\n(iii). at the time such person furnished information about the violation, no criminal or civil action or proceeding, or administrative action had commenced with respect to such violation, and the person did not have actual knowledge of the existence of an investigation into such violation.\nb.  A person who violates this section shall also be liable for the costs, expenses and attorneys’ fees of a civil enforcement action and for the cost of the city’s investigation.\n§7-804.  Civil actions for false claims. a.  If the corporation counsel finds that a person has violated or is violating the provisions of section 7-803 of this chapter, he or she may institute a civil enforcement action against that person in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nb.  1. Any person may submit a proposed civil complaint to the city alleging violations of section 7-803.  Proposed civil complaints shall be signed and verified and shall include all material evidence and information possessed by such person in support of the allegations in such proposed civil complaints.  The city shall diligently investigate all such proposed civil complaints.  The city may request such additional information as it deems necessary from the person submitting a proposed civil complaint.\n2. The corporation counsel and the commissioner of investigation shall promulgate rules establishing a protocol detailing the procedures by which the city will address proposed civil complaints after they have been submitted, which protocol shall include the requirement that within one hundred eighty days of receipt of a proposed civil complaint, the city shall, in writing, notify the person who submitted the proposed civil complaint that the corporation counsel: \n(i)  intends to commence a civil enforcement action based on the facts alleged in the proposed civil complaint against one or more of the defendants named in the proposed civil complaint, in which case he or she shall commence such action within ninety days of such notification, provided that if the corporation counsel determines that a delay in commencing such action is warranted, he or she may delay such commencement, upon notice to the person who submitted the proposed civil complaint, for an additional ninety days at which time he or she shall commence such action;\n(ii)  designates the person or, if the person is not an attorney, the attorney of such person, as a special assistant corporation counsel for purposes of filing a civil enforcement action against one or more of the defendants named in the proposed civil complaint; or\n(iii)  declines to commence a civil enforcement action or designate such person to commence a civil enforcement action in which case the corporation counsel shall state in the notification its reason for doing so.\n3. The corporation counsel shall commence a civil enforcement action or designate the person who submitted the proposed civil complaint or, if the person is not an attorney, his or her attorney, to commence a civil enforcement action unless:\n(i) the proposed civil complaint is barred for the reasons set forth in subdivision d of this section; \n(ii) the corporation counsel has determined that the proposed civil complaint is based upon an interpretation of law or regulation which if adopted, would result in significant cost to the city; \n(iii) the corporation counsel has determined that commencing a civil enforcement action would interfere with a contractual relationship between the city and an entity providing goods or services which would significantly interfere with the provision of important goods or services, or would jeopardize the health and safety of the public; or\n(iv) the corporation counsel has determined that the complaint, if filed in a court of competent jurisdiction, would be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be based.\nc.  If the commissioner of investigation determines that a civil enforcement action may interfere with or jeopardize an investigation by a governmental agency, then the corporation counsel may decline to commence a civil enforcement action based on a proposed civil complaint or to designate the person who submitted such proposed civil complaint to commence such action, provided that the corporation counsel notifies the person who submitted the proposed civil complaint of such determination within ninety days of receipt by the city of such proposed civil complaint and every one hundred eighty days thereafter until such time as the commissioner of investigation determines that such civil enforcement action would no longer interfere with or jeopardize a governmental investigation, at which time the corporation counsel shall provide to the person who submitted the proposed complaint the notification required in paragraph two of subdivision b of this section.  The determination by the commissioner of investigation shall be final. \nd. Certain actions barred.  This section shall not apply to claims, records, or statements made pursuant to federal, state or local tax law nor to any proposed civil complaints:\n1.  based upon one or more false claims with a cumulative value of less than twenty five thousand dollars;   \n2.  based upon allegations or transactions which are the subject of any pending criminal or civil action or proceeding, including a civil enforcement action, or an administrative action in which the city is already a party;\n3.  derived from public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil or administrative hearing, in a legislative or administrative report, hearing, audit or investigation, or upon allegations or transactions disclosed by the news media and likely to be seen by the city officials responsible for addressing false claims, unless the person who submitted the proposed complaint is the primary source of the information;\n4.  based upon information discovered by an employee of the city, state or federal government in the course of his or her employment unless: (i) such employee first reported such information to the department of investigation; and (ii) the city failed to act on the information within six months of its receipt by the department of investigation; or\n5.  against the federal government, the state of New York, the city or any officer or employee acting within the scope of his or her employment.\ne. Nothing herein shall be construed as authorizing anyone other than the corporation counsel and a person or attorney authorized pursuant to this chapter to commence a civil enforcement action to represent the city of New York in legal proceedings.\nf. Pending and related actions. 1. No person, other than the corporation counsel, may intervene or bring a related action based upon the facts underlying a civil enforcement action, unless such other person has first obtained the permission of the corporation counsel to intervene or to bring such related action.\n2. Regardless of whether the corporation counsel has commenced a civil enforcement action or another party has been designated to do so, the city may elect to pursue any alternate action with respect to the presentation of false claims, provided that the person who submitted the proposed civil complaint upon which such alternate action is based, if any, shall be entitled to the same percentage share of any cash proceeds recovered by the city as such person would have been entitled to if such alternate action was a civil enforcement action.\ng. Rights of the parties.  1. If the corporation counsel elects to commence a civil enforcement action, then the city shall have the sole authority for prosecuting, and, subject to the approval of the comptroller, settling the action and may move to dismiss the action, or may settle the action notwithstanding the objections of the person who submitted the proposed civil complaint upon which such civil enforcement action is based.\n2.  If a person who submitted a proposed complaint or his or her attorney has been designated to commence a civil enforcement action, then the corporation counsel and such authorized person or attorney shall share authority for prosecuting the case.  However, the corporation counsel may move to dismiss the action notwithstanding the objection of the person who submitted the proposed civil complaint provided such person has been served with an appropriate motion and the court has provided such person with an opportunity to be heard.  The corporation counsel may also, subject to the approval of the comptroller, settle the action notwithstanding the objection of the person who submitted the proposed civil complaint if the court determines after providing such person with an opportunity to be heard, that the proposed settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable.\n3. The corporation counsel may apply to the court for and the court may issue an order restricting the participation of a person designated to commence a civil enforcement action in such litigation notwithstanding the objections of such person if the court determines, after providing such person an opportunity to be heard, that such person’s unrestricted participation during the course of the litigation would interfere with or unduly delay the prosecution of the case, or would be repetitious or irrelevant, or upon a showing by the defendant that such person’s unrestricted participation during the course of the litigation would be for purposes of harassment or would cause the defendant undue burden.  Such restrictions may include, but need not be limited to: (i) limiting the number of witnesses such person may call, (ii) limiting the length of the testimony of such witnesses, (iii) limiting such person’s cross-examination of witnesses, or (iv) otherwise limiting such person’s participation in the litigation.\n4. The corporation counsel may apply to the court for a stay of any civil enforcement action if it will interfere with any investigation or prosecution of a criminal matter arising out of the same facts.\nh.  Under no circumstances shall the city be bound by an act of a person designated to commence a civil enforcement action.\ni. Awards from proceeds.  1. If the corporation counsel has elected to commence a civil enforcement action based on a proposed civil complaint, then the person or persons who submitted such proposed civil complaint collectively shall be entitled to receive between ten and twenty-five percent of the proceeds recovered in such civil enforcement action or in settlement of such action.\n2. If a person, or such person’s attorney has been designated to commence a civil enforcement action based on such person’s proposed civil complaint, then such person shall be entitled to receive between fifteen and thirty percent of the proceeds recovered in such civil enforcement action or in settlement of such action.\n3.

Legislative findings and intent. The city of New York engages in annual disbursements of billions of dollars in public funds through one of the largest budgets in the United States, and is, therefore, desirous of preventing the payment of fraudulent claims by the city at taxpayers\\rquote  expense. Compensation by the city of claims that are false or fraudulent has a considerable impact upon the city\\rquote s treasury through the loss of untold amounts of public dollars. \\par\nThe federal false claims act provides an excellent model for combating fraud by government contractors and other parties. Since the federal false claims act was substantially amended in 1986, the federal government has recovered billions of dollars under the act.  Additionally, a number of states have enacted civil false claims statutes of their own in order to impede fraud in state programs and to protect state treasuries.\\par\nThe Council therefore finds that the city of New York should enact legislation modeled on the federal false claims act, to enhance the city\\rquote s ability to recover monetary damages from parties who file fraudulent claims for payment of city funds and to recover the substantial costs that are incurred in protecting the taxpayers against such fraud.\\i\\par\n\\pard\\fi720\\sl480\\slmult1\\i0\\'a72.
