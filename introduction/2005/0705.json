  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\nSection 1. Declaration of legislative findings and intent. The Council of the City of New York recognizes that the City is known throughout the world for its landmarks.  As the largest city in the nation, and as one the oldest, the City’s landscape is characterized by a wealth of buildings and other structures that evoke an indelible sense of time and place, and that retain the aesthetic and cultural values of the society that created them. The Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) is the city agency responsible for identifying and designating properties within the five boroughs whose preservation will benefit present and future generations of New Yorkers.  Since its creation in 1965 the LPC has designated 1,119 individual landmarks, 83 historic districts, and 11 district extensions, totaling approximately 23,000 buildings. The Council recognizes the LPC’s achievements. Nevertheless there is mounting criticism by stakeholders throughout the community, including property owners, preservation groups, public officials, and others, that the landmarks identification and designation procedures are not sufficiently transparent. The Council has consistently found that transparency in government is one of the cornerstones of democracy. Accordingly, this local law is designed to enhance the transparency of the LPC’s decision-making process. \n\n§2. Subdivision g of section 25-303 of the administrative code of the city of New York as amended by Local Law number 71 for the year 1991 is amended by adding new subsections 3 and 4, to read as follows:\n\n(3) The council may, by a majority vote, direct the commission to hold a public hearing regarding a proposed landmark designation pursuant to subdivisions a and b of this section within sixty (60) days of such vote.\n(4) The commission shall, within sixty (60) days of receiving written notice that the New York State Historic Preservation Office has found that a property that is the subject of a proposed landmark designation is eligible to be listed on the New York State Register of Historic Places, calendar a public hearing regarding such proposed designation.      \n\n§ 3. This local law shall take effect immediately.\n\nDS\nLS# 3353",
