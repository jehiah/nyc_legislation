Such amendments shall be submitted to the commissioner, the city chief procurement officer and the speaker of the council at least thirty days prior to implementation.  \nh.  Achieving agency participation goals.  (1) Each agency head shall be directly accountable for the goals set forth in his or her agency's utilization plan. \n(2) Each agency shall make all reasonable efforts to meet the participation goals established in its agency utilization plan.

If the city chief procurement officer determines that it is both practicable and advantageous in light of cost and other relevant factors to divide such contracts into smaller contracts, then he or she shall direct the agency to do so.\n(vii) Agencies shall examine their internal procurement policies, procedures and practices and, where practicable, address those elements, if any, that may negatively affect participation of MBEs and WBEs in city procurement. \n(viii) Agency M/WBE officers shall, in accordance with guidelines established by the city chief procurement officer, establish a process for quarterly meetings with MBEs and WBEs to discuss what the agency looks for in evaluating bids and proposals.  \n(ix)  Agencies shall encourage prime contractors to enter joint venture agreements with MBEs and WBEs.\ni. Participation goals for construction and professional services contracts.  (1) Prior to issuing the solicitation of bids or proposals for individual construction and professional services contracts, agencies shall establish a target subcontracting percentage for the contract and participation goals for MBEs and WBEs.   The “target subcontracting percentage” for the contract shall represent the percentage of the total contract which the agency anticipates a typical prime contractor in the relevant industry would in the normal course of business award to one or more subcontractors for amounts under one million dollars.  The participation goals established for a contract shall represent a percentage of the total dollar value of all subcontracts for amounts under one million dollars pursuant to the award.

Participation goals for construction and professional services contracts.  \\b0 (1) Prior to issuing the solicitation of bids or proposals for individual construction and professional services contracts, \\expndtw0 agencies shall establish a target subcontracting percentage for the contract and participation goals for MBEs and WBEs.   \\lang1024 The \\ldblquote target subcontracting percentage\\rdblquote  for the contract shall represent the percentage of the total contract which the agency anticipates a typical prime contractor in the relevant industry would in the normal course of business award to one or more subcontractors for amounts under one million dollars.  \\lang1033 The participation goals established for a contract shall represent a percentage of the total dollar value of all subcontracts for amounts under one million dollars pursuant to the award.  Such goals may be greater than, less than or the same as the relevant citywide goal or goals established pursuant to subdivision d of this section\\lang1024   In\\lang1033  determining the participation goals for a particular contract, an agency shall consider the following factors:\\par\n\\pard\\li720\\sl480\\slmult1 (i) the scope of work;\\par\n\\pard\\fi720\\sl480\\slmult1 (ii) the availability of  MBEs and WBEs able to perform the particular tasks required in the contract;\\par\n\\pard\\fi720\\sl480\\slmult1\\qj (iii) the extent to which the type of work involved in the contract presents subcontracting opportunities for amounts under one million dollars;\\par\n(iv) the agency's progress to date toward meeting its annual participation goals through race-neutral,  gender-neutral and other means, and the agency's expectations as to the effect such methods will have on participation of MBEs and WBEs in the agency\\rquote s future contracts;and(v) any other factors the contracting agency deems relevant.\\par\n(2) A contracting agency shall not be required to establish participation goals (i) for procurements described in subdivision q of this section; or \\par\n (ii) when the agency has already attained the relevant goal in its annual utilization plan, or expects that it will attain such goal without the use of such participation goals.\\par\n(3) For each contract in which a contracting agency has established participation goals, such agency shall state in the solicitation for such contract that bidders and/or proposers shall be required to agree as a material term of the contract that, with respect to the total amount of the contract to be awarded to one or more subcontractors pursuant to subcontracts for amounts under one million dollars, the contractor shall be subject to participation goals unless such goals are modified by the agency in accordance with this section. \\par\n(4) For each contract in which participation goals are established, the agency shall include in its solicitation and/or bidding materials, a referral to the directories prepared by the division pursuant to this section.  \\par\n(5) For each contract for which participation goals are established the contractor shall be required to submit with its bid or proposal, a utilization plan indicating the percentage of the work it intends to subcontract, and the percentage of work it intends to award to subcontractors for amounts under one million dollars, and, in cases where the contractor intends to award subcontracts for amounts under one million dollars, a description of the type and dollar value of  work designated for participation by MBEs and/or WBEs, and the time frames in which such work is scheduled to begin and end.  When the utilization plan indicates that the bidder or proposer does not intend to award the target subcontracting percentage, the bid or proposal shall not be deemed responsive unless the agency has granted a pre-award waiver pursuant to paragraph 11 of this subdivision.\\par\n(6) For each contract for which a utilization plan has been submitted, the contracting agency shall require that within thirty days of the issuance of notice to proceed, the contractor submit a list of persons to which it intends to award subcontracts within the next twelve months. In the event that a contracting agency disapproves a contractor's selection of a subcontractor or subcontractors, the contracting agency shall allow such contractor a reasonable time to propose alternate subcontractors.\\par\n (7)  For each contract for which a utilization plan has been submitted, the contractor shall, with each voucher for payment, and/or periodically as the agency may require, submit statements, certified under penalty of perjury, which shall include, but not be limited to, the total amount paid to subcontractors (including subcontractors that are not MBEs or WBEs); the names, addresses and contact numbers of each MBE or WBE hired as a subcontractor pursuant to such plan as well as the dates and amounts paid to each MBE or WBE.  The contractor shall also submit, along with its voucher for final payment, the total amount paid to subcontractors (including subcontractors that are not MBEs or WBEs); and a final list, certified under penalty of perjury, which shall include the name, address and contact information of each subcontractor that is an MBE or WBE hired pursuant to such plan, the work performed by, and the dates and amounts paid to each.\\par\n(8) If payments made to, or work performed by, MBEs or WBEs are less than the \\expndtw4 amount \\expndtw0 specified in the contractor\\rquote s utilization plan, the agency shall take appropriate action in accordance with subdivision o of this section, \\expndtw4 unless \\expndtw0 the contractor has obtained a modification of its utilization plan pursuant to paragraph 12 of this subdivision.  \\par\n(9) When advertising a solicitation for bids or proposals for a contract for which a participation goal has been established, agencies shall include in the advertisement a general statement that the contract will be subject to participation goals for MBEs and/or WBEs. \\par\n(10)  In the event that a contractor with a contract that includes a utilization plan submits a request for a change order the value of which exceeds ten percent of such contract, the agency shall establish participation goals as if for a new contract for the work to be performed pursuant to such change order.  \\par\n(11)  Pre-award waiver.  (i) Subject to subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, the contracting agency may grant a full or partial waiver of the target subcontracting percentage to a bidder or proposer who demonstrates that it has legitimate business reasons for proposing the level of subcontracting in its utilization plan.  The contracting agency shall make its determination in light of factors which shall include, but not be limited to, whether the bidder or proposer has the capacity and the bona fide intention to perform the contract without any subcontracting, or to perform the contract without awarding the amount of subcontracts for under one million dollars represented by the target subcontracting percentage.  In making such determination, the agency may consider whether the utilization plan is consistent with past subcontracting practices of the bidder or proposer, and whether the bidder or proposer has made good faith efforts to identify portions of the contract that it intends to subcontract.  Within thirty days of the registration of a contract, the city chief contracting officer shall notify the council of any such waiver granted with respect to the contract.\\par\n(ii)  The agency M/WBE officer shall provide written notice of requests for a full or partial waiver of the target subcontracting percentage to the division and the city chief procurement officer and shall not approve any such request without the approval of the city chief procurement officer, provided that the city chief procurement officer, upon adequate assurances of an agency\\rquote s ability to administer its utilization plan in accordance with the provisions of this section, may determine that further approval from the city chief procurement officer is not required with respect to such requests for an agency\\rquote s contracts or particular categories of an agency\\rquote s contracts.  The city chief procurement officer shall notify the speaker of the council in writing within seven days of the approval of a request for a full or partial waiver of a target subcontracting percentage, provided that where an agency has been authorized to grant waivers without approval of the chief procurement officer, such notice shall be provided to the speaker of the council by the agency.  Such notification shall include, but not be limited to, the name of contractor, the original target subcontracting percentage, the waiver request, including all documentation, and an explanation for the approval of such request.\\par\n(12) Modification of utilization plans.
