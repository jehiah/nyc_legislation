  "Summary": "This bill would require the Fire Department, in conjunction with the Mayor’s Office of Film, Theatre, and Broadcasting, to establish procedures to ensure that the Fire Department receives real-time access to information submitted in connection with permits for rigging and filming activities at production locations. Additionally, such procedures would provide local firehouses with notification each time a permit is issued for filming or rigging activities at a production location within the area of response for such firehouse, and enable the Department to familiarize local firehouses, or other members of the Department, with field conditions and fire safety considerations at such production locations. Finally, the bill would require the clearing of any outstanding FDNY or Department of Buildings violations that constitute life safety hazards prior to the issuing of permits activities at a production location.",
