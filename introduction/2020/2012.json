  "Summary": "This bill would require the commissioner of the New York City Police Department (“NYPD”) to issue a quarterly report on custodial interrogations of minors. Such report would include the total number of times the department attempted to conduct a custodial interrogation of a minor in the previous quarter, disaggregated by: the race, age, and gender of the minor; the precinct of the arresting officer; the borough where the arrest took place; whether a parent or legal guardian of the minor was informed of the arrest prior to the interrogation; whether the minor spoke to an attorney prior to the interrogation; whether the minor was notified of their Miranda Rights; and whether the minor waived such rights. The first report would be due on January 31, 2021 and would be posted on the NYPD website and submitted to the Council, Mayor, and Public Advocate.",
