It would extend the affirmative defense period after notice of a change in parking restrictions from five days to fifteen days, and additionally require that no vehicle may be towed as a result of a violation of a new parking restriction for a period of thirty days after posting notice of the change unless towing the vehicle is determined to be necessary for public safety.",
