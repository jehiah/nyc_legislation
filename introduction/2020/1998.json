  "Summary": "This bill would create a Commission on Infectious Diseases for the purpose of studying infectious diseases worldwide and developing citywide and agency-specific plans to address the risks that such diseases pose to public health. The Commission would meet at least twice each year, as well as during infectious disease related emergencies, and submit annual reports to the Mayor and the Council with recommendations containing proposed plans that the City may implement in the event of an epidemic, pandemic or other public health emergency related to infectious disease. The Commissioner of Emergency Management would be required to issue an annual report to confirm whether the City would adopt or reject the recommendations of the Commission in its preparations and response to infectious disease related emergencies.",
