  "Summary": "Third-party food delivery services are entities that provide restaurants with online order and delivery services. This bill would amend the conditions in existing law under which third-party food delivery services are prohibited from charging restaurants for telephone orders that did not result in a transaction during the call. Under the existing law, such charges are prohibited only during states of emergency when on-premises dining is prohibited entirely, plus an additional 90 days thereafter. This bill would instead prohibit such charges during states of emergency when restaurants are restricted from operating at maximum indoor occupancy, plus an additional 90 days thereafter.",
