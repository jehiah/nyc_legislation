  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. The department of buildings shall conduct a study of the safety and feasibility of authorizing the use of unmanned aircraft systems, in conjunction with physical examinations and close-up inspections, for critical examinations of a building's exterior walls, required by section 28-302.2 of the administrative code of the city of New York. The department shall consider, but not be limited to, the following subjects:\n      a. Whether authorizing such examinations to be conducted with the use of unmanned aircraft systems would: (i) be prohibited by any provision of law, rules and regulations, policies or directives of the federal aviation administration; (ii) conflict with any rules, regulations or policies of any New York state or city agencies; (iii) provide any increase in pedestrian safety over that afforded by current building examination practices; (iv) reduce the use of sidewalk sheds and scaffolding citywide; and (v) provide any economic benefits through cost savings or job creation; and\n      b. Whether there are any other obstacles or concerns related to authorizing such examinations to be conducted through the use of unmanned aircraft systems, including but not limited to safety and privacy issues such as surveillance, data security and data retention.\n      � 2. The department shall issue a report of the study's findings to the mayor and the speaker of the council upon completion of such study, which shall be no later than October 31, 2021.\n      � 3.
