This bill removes this exception, but maintains existing exceptions that apply to all types of discrimination in housing accommodations. This bill also clarifies the definition of “lawful source of income” to align more closely with State law and include all lawful income that low-income New Yorkers may receive, such as child support, alimony, and other types of housing assistance.","TextID":69289,"Text":"Int.
