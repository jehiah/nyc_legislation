  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Social Services (DSS) to provide all single adults in the City’s various shelter system, including Department of Homeless Services, Department of Youth and Community Development and faith-based or community shelters, as well as single adults experiencing homelessness who are currently unsheltered and adult members of families who are symptomatic or have tested positive with COVID-19 with the option of transferring to a private room.  It would require that DHS provide a daily report to the Speaker of the Council regarding the number of rooms DHS has made available to single adults and that are occupied by single adults, the unmet need for private rooms among this population and aggregated demographic information on single adults occupying private rooms. The bill would also require that DHS create and implement a plan that would ensure that shelters reduce the risk of COVID-19 by locating beds at least six feet apart unless they are located in a private room occupied by members of the same family.",
