  "Summary": "This bill would require the Mayor’s Office of Citywide Event Coordination and Management (CECM), in consultation with the Department of Cultural Affairs (DCLA), the Department of Parks and Recreation (Parks), the Department of Information, Technology and Telecommunications (DOITT) and any other relevant agency or office, to create a website that would provide information on open spaces, such as roadways, parks, or pedestrian plazas, designated by the City for art and cultural programming, facilitate the use of such space by art and cultural institutions and allow users to search for such open space on a map. The website would also allow users to search for information about outdoor programs offered by art and cultural institutions that are coordinated by CECM and provide information about other events either hosted by art and cultural institutions or outdoor events held on private property, to the extent such information is provided to CECM.",
