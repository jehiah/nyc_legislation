  "Summary": "This bill would establish a two-year pilot program in at least two boroughs to use community locations to provide domestic violence survivors access to the internet. In establishing the program, a working group, consisting of the Director of the Mayor’s Office to End Domestic and Gender-Based Violence and six representatives of community-based domestic violence organizations, would conduct a feasibility study and produce a report. The Director would be required to establish the pilot program, based on the recommendations in the feasibility report. The working group would produce two reports on the pilot program, a progress report and a final report, which would provide the number of participants, the information that participants accessed, feedback, implementation challenges, and recommendations on expansion.",
