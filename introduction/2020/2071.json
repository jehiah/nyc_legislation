  "Summary": "This bill would categorize existing non-tobacco hookah establishments that make over 50 percent of their gross revenue through the sale of non-tobacco smoking products as class A non-tobacco hookah establishments and would create a class B category of non-tobacco hookah establishments, that make under 50 percent of their gross revenue through the sale of non-tobacco smoking products. The bill would also require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to accept new permit applications for class B establishments, extend the validity period for such permits and allow for the renewal and transfer of such permits. This bill would also allow class B establishments to expand or change their locations and prohibit the sale of non-tobacco hookah for consumption at class B establishments before 10:00 p.m. or after 4:00 a.m. In addition, individuals under the age of 21 would not be permitted to enter class B establishments at the times that non-tobacco hookah may be sold.",
