  "Summary": "This bill would require motion picture theaters to provide movie screenings with open captioning. Open captioning is the written, on-screen display of a movie’s dialogue and non-speech information. Motion picture theaters that have more than two screens and provide more than 10 showings per week would be required to provide open captioning for at least half of showings of each movie per week. At least half of the required open captioned screenings would be during peak movie attendance hours, which are between 6:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. on Fridays and between 12:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays. At least half of the required open captioned movie screenings that do not occur during peak movie attendance hours would be screened between 6:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. Motion picture theaters would be required to advertise the availability of open captioned movies in the same manner as all other advertisements for movie screenings. This bill would also include a civil penalty of no less than $100 and not more than $500 for a violation of these requirements.",
