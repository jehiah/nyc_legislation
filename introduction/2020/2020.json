  "Summary": "This bill would require that movie theaters showing over 10 movies a week provide open captions for at least one quarter of all showings when a movie is shown four or more times.  However, theaters more than four open caption showings of a single movie in one week would not be required. At least half of the open captioned showings would be during peak attendance hours. Peak attendance showings start after 5:59 and end before 11:01 on Friday and begin after 11:29 am and end before 11:01 pm on Saturday and Sunday. If fewer than one in eight showings is scheduled for peak attendance hours or similar times on other weekdays, the screening during those hours must be open captioned. Open caption showings that play at the same time do not count towards this minimum and a theater may show more open captioned movies than required. A theater must advertise open caption showings the same way they do other showings and must maintain documents to show compliance with these requirements for at least three years. A theater violating this law is subject to penalties. Films that are produced and distributed without open captioning are exempt from this requirement.",
