  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation (DOT) to work with the Department of Environmental Protection, Department of Consumer Affairs and Worker Protection, and Small Business Services to study the impacts of e-commerce deliveries during the COVID-19 pandemic. DOT would file with the Mayor and the Council and post on its website an annual report about how the volume of deliveries has changed since the onset of COVID-19, and the impact of such deliveries on traffic, road maintenance, pedestrian spaces, local businesses, air quality, and how the Open Streets program has effected e-commerce deliveries. The commissioner of transportation would be required to submit this report each year until 2023, and include recommendations to reduce detrimental impacts of increased e-commerce deliveries.",
