  "Summary": "This bill would require the Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) to develop an e-transportation application that would allow customers to electronically arrange transportation with a yellow taxicab, a green street hail vehicle, a for-hire vehicle, or high-volume for-hire vehicle. The application would be the only application used by yellow taxicab or green street hail drivers to accept electronic transportation requests. The bill would require that the application be capable of allowing customers to electronically arrange transportation with an accessible vehicle. The bill would also require the TLC to develop a program to allow third-party applications to submit electronic transportation requests to drivers through the application.",

Such e-transportation application shall be the sole method to electronically arrange transportation with an accessible taxi or accessible HAIL vehicle. The T-PEP and L-PEP systems shall be the sole systems authorized by the commission for taxicabs and HAIL vehicles to receive electronic transportation requests. The commission shall approve the e-transportation application, provided it meets the following minimum criteria:\n      1.

A taxicab, HAIL vehicle, for-hire vehicle, or high-volume for-hire service affiliated vehicle driver shall not be required to accept a passenger through the e-transportation application. After a driver accepts a transportation arrangement through the e-transportation application, such driver must pick up the e-transportation passenger. Any driver found in violation of this subdivision shall be subject to penalties pursuant to paragraph 4 of subdivision b of section 19-507.\n      d.

The API shall be reviewed by the commission, or an entity approved by the commission, at least once a quarter and more often as necessary to ensure that the API continues to meet the requirements of third-party e-transportation applications and to update the API if necessary to meet such requirements. Such third-party e-transportation applications:\n      1. May charge a fee for their use;\n      2. Shall not influence a passenger attempting to request e-transportation from a taxicab or eligible HAIL vehicle to use another class of for-hire vehicle;\n      3.

Prohibit third-party e-transportation applications from obtaining information about taxicab drivers, eligible HAIL vehicle drivers, for-hire vehicle drivers, and high-volume for-hire service affiliated vehicle drivers other than their names, commission drivers' license numbers, and vehicle numbers; and\n      2. Prohibit drivers from obtaining personally identifiable information about their passengers, except that a passenger may be given the option of waiving such privacy protection.\n      o.
