  "Summary": "This bill would require the Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) to develop an e-hail application which would allow customers to electronically hail a yellow taxicab or a green street hail vehicle. The application would be the only application used by yellow taxicab or green street hail drivers to accept electronic hails. The bill would require that the application be capable of allowing customers to electronically hail an accessible vehicle. The bill would also require the TLC to develop a program to allow third-party applications to submit electronic hail requests to drivers through the application.",

The commission shall develop or cause to be developed an e-hail application to enable customers to electronically hail taxicab or eligible HAIL vehicles, including the ability to electronically hail an accessible vehicle. Such e-hail application shall be the sole method to electronically hail an accessible vehicle. The T-PEP and L-PEP systems shall be the sole systems authorized by the commission for taxicabs and HAIL vehicles to receive electronic hails. Any e-hail application, provided it meets the following minimum criteria, shall be eligible for an e-hail license:\n      1. There shall be no charge to a passenger or driver for the use of such e-hail application.\n      2. The e-hail application shall only dispatch e-hails to HAIL vehicles within the geographic boundaries set by state law for HAIL vehicle pickups.\n      3. The e-hail application shall allow passengers to provide comments to the commission regarding the ride, including but not limited to, compliments and complaints, as well as allow passengers to rate their drivers.\n      4. The e-hail application shall display all available taxicabs and HAIL vehicles within a certain radius of the passenger to be determined by the commission and shall be capable of transmitting to the passenger the vehicle number and name of the driver of the first vehicle to accept the hail, the estimated time of arrival as close to real time as feasible, and the location of the vehicle accepting the hail.\n      5. All payments made through the e-hail application for fares shall be processed through a T-PEP or L-PEP system.\n      6. The e-hail application shall allow passengers to electronically hail an accessible vehicle.\n      7. The e-hail application shall be capable of allowing drivers to accept an e-hail while the vehicle is in motion with a single touch or with voice activation. The e-hail application must be locked while the vehicle is in motion.\n      c. A taxicab or HAIL vehicle driver shall not be required to accept a passenger through the e-hail application provided that once such driver accepts a hail through the e-hail application, such driver must pick up the e-hail passenger. Any driver found in violation of this subdivision shall be subject to penalties pursuant to paragraph b of section 19-507.\n      d. Upon accepting an e-hail through the e-hail application, the driver of a taxicab or eligible HAIL vehicle shall cause the roof light of such vehicle to indicate that such vehicle is not available for incoming passengers. Such driver shall not begin charging a fare until the passenger has been picked up.\n      e. A taxicab or eligible HAIL vehicle driver shall only be permitted to charge the passenger picked up through the e-hail application the metered rates provided by law or rule.\n      f. To use the e-hail application, a passenger must create and manage an account through the e-hail application, as well as on a website approved by the commission. Passengers shall have the option of entering payment information for credit or debit cards or other approved forms of electronic payment. The e-hail application and website shall be capable of offering users the option to save such payment information.\n      g. The commission may ban passengers who it determines have misused the e-hail application.\n      h. The commission, or an entity approved by the commission, shall maintain the e-hail application and website, including compiling data on its use. Such data shall include, but need not be limited to, the number of passengers who have hailed a taxicab or HAIL vehicle through the application and the geographic area from which each e-hail originates.\n      i. The commission shall advertise and promote the e-hail application for no less than 30 seconds during its allotted time for public service announcements on a T-PEP or L-PEP display from 90 days prior to the e-hail application going into service and until, at a minimum, one year after the e-hail application goes into service. The commission may adopt additional promotional methods.\n      j. The commission shall provide training for all drivers applying for a taxicab driver's license or for-hire vehicle driver's license to drive a HAIL vehicle on the use of the e-hail application mandated under subdivision b of this section. Drivers must also receive the training in order to renew such licenses. The commission shall further provide training for such drivers as necessary.\n      k. Any tip or gratuity shall, in its entirety, be provided to the driver. A taxicab or HAIL vehicle base must remit to the driver the entirety of any sum designated as a gratuity collected by such base from the passenger on behalf of the driver.\n      l. The commission shall develop an API that allows third-party e-hail applications approved by the commission based on this section and rules of the commission to submit hail requests for fulfillment by taxicabs and eligible HAIL vehicles through the e-hail application. The API shall be reviewed by the commission, or a commission approved entity when necessary, but no less than once every three months, to update the API if the commissioner determines that such API is not meeting the requirements of third-party applications. The commission shall not adopt any rules regulating the dispatch practices used by such third-party e-hail applications, provided that such methodology does not otherwise violate any rules of the commission. Such third-party e-hail applications:\n      1.  May charge a fee for their use;\n      2. Shall not influence a passenger attempting to e-hail a taxicab or eligible HAIL vehicle to use another class of for-hire vehicle;\n      3.

Shall be responsible for recruiting drivers and passengers, and marketing such applications.\n      m. The API mandated under subdivision l of this section shall, at a minimum, be capable of the following:\n      1.

Receiving dispatch requests from commission approved third-party e-hail applications and forwarding requests to appropriate taxicabs and eligible HAIL vehicles;\n      3.  Accepting dispatch requests and forwarding an acceptance to the e-hail application; and\n      4.  Securely transmitting fare payment instructions from commission approved third-party e-hail applications to the T-PEP or L-PEP system.\n      n. The commission shall create a privacy policy for the use of the API mandated under subdivision k of this section.  This privacy policy shall, at a minimum:\n      1. Prohibit third-party applications from obtaining information about taxicab drivers, other than their names, commission drivers' license numbers and vehicle numbers; and\n      2. Prohibit drivers from obtaining personally identifiable information about their passengers, provided however, a passenger may be given the option of waiving such privacy protection.\n      o. The following integration shall be required of T-PEP and L-PEP systems via the API mandated under subdivision l of this section, except that third-party e-hail application developers shall not be required to use the following information:\n      1. Driver/medallion login information;\n      2. Itemized fare information; and\n      3. E-payments via a PCI-certified processing in order for such T-PEP and L-PEP systems to be capable of accepting from the application payment information necessary to capture the trip record and to provide a printed receipt.\n      p. The commission may by rule establish additional functions of the e-hail application other than those required by and consistent with this section.\n      � 2. This local law takes effect 90 days after it becomes law, except that the commission shall take all actions necessary for its implementation, including the promulgation of rules, prior to such effective date.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAV/JG\nInt. 574-2014/LS #13817\n9/28/20 1:31 PM\n\n\n1\n      \n      \n      1",
