  "Summary": "This bill would require the Office of Emergency Management, in consultation with the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and the Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability, to prepare and submit an annual plan beginning by May 15, 2021, describing how the city would inform residents on the dangers of heat exposure, access to cooling, including cooling centers, and how vulnerable populations can stay cool during heat-related emergencies.  The plan would also include measures for large office buildings to reduce stress on the electric grid during the summer months.  The plan would be updated annually.",
