  "Summary": "This bill would require the Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability (OLTPS) to develop climate resiliency design guidelines, pursuant to a pilot program, for City capital projects. OLTPS, in consultation with other City agencies, environmental justice organizations with expertise in climate resiliency, and members of the public with expertise in climate resiliency, climate design, the built environment, engineering, and environmental justice issues, would also use the climate resiliency design guidelines to develop a climate resiliency score metric for capital projects. Such score would account for flooding risk, energy efficiency, energy resilience and on-site water capture and management. Every City capital project above a threshold construction cost would be evaluated for its resiliency and have to meet or exceed a minimum resiliency score.",
