  "Summary": "This bill would require the Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability (OLTPS) to develop climate resiliency design guidelines, pursuant to a pilot program, for City capital projects. OLTPS, in consultation with other City agencies, environmental justice organizations with expertise in climate resiliency, and members of the public with expertise in climate resiliency, climate design, the built environment, engineering, and environmental justice issues, would also use the climate resiliency design guidelines to develop a climate resiliency score metric for capital projects. Such score would account for flooding risk, energy efficiency, energy resilience and on-site water capture and management. Every City capital project above a threshold construction cost would be evaluated for its resiliency and have to meet or exceed a minimum resiliency score.",

The project design shall be submitted to the office for calculation of a resiliency score and scored by such office prior to being made available for review by the respective council committee, borough president and the community board pursuant to section 223 of the charter. If a covered project is not subject to section 223 of the charter, the project design shall be submitted to the office for the calculation of a resiliency score prior to registration of a construction contract. Agencies must resubmit the covered project to the office for scoring if there are design changes that could result in a change to the resiliency score.\n      f. Each covered project that is a substantial improvement or the reconstruction, installation, retrofit, improvement or alteration to infrastructure shall be required to either:\n      1. Meet or exceed the minimum resiliency score; or\n      2.
