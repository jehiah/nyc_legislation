The Department of Transportation (DOT) would be required to create a self-certification process that non-tobacco hookah establishment owners must complete before offering outdoor smoking. Such process would not require DOT approval, however, a self-certification could be suspended or terminated by DOT or DOHMH for non-compliance with requirements of the program or for the protection of health and safety. Individuals under 21 would not be permitted to sit in such outdoor smoking area. The outdoor hookah program would run until at least November 8, 2020, with the possibility of extension up to December 31, 2020.","TextID":69107,"Text":"Int.
