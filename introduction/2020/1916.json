  "Summary": "On March 17, 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, several businesses were ordered to close. Restaurants were required to stop providing dine-in service. As restaurants face unprecedented financial losses and can no longer utilize their sidewalk cafes during the state of emergency, this bill requires the City to waive and/or refund all revocable consent fees for unenclosed sidewalk cafes due between March 1, 2020 and February 28, 2021. Enclosed sidewalk café consent fees would be waived for the duration of the Mayor’s Emergency Executive Order No. 105 published on April 4, 2020.",
