  "Summary": "The bill would prohibit third-party delivery services, entities that provide restaurants with online order and delivery services, from charging restaurants for telephone orders with customers that did not result in an actual transaction during the call. The prohibition would apply only to periods when a state of emergency is in effect in the city and restaurants are prohibited from offering food for consumption on-premises, plus an additional 90 days thereafter.  Violations would be subject to civil penalties of up to $500 per restaurant per day.",
