The prohibition would apply only to periods when a state of emergency is in effect in the city and restaurants are prohibited from offering food for consumption on-premises, plus an additional 90 days thereafter.  Violations would be subject to civil penalties of up to $500 per restaurant per day.","TextID":68601,"Text":"Int.
