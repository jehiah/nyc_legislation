This bill would also require OPHC to provide information to the affected community within 24 hours of the occurrence of a violent hate crime when practicable. This bill would also require OPHC to notify the Mayor, the Speaker of the Council, the Public Advocate and the council member of the district in which a violent hate crime has occurred. These requirements would be subject to an exception for information that is confidential or which would compromise law enforcement investigations or operations if disclosed.",
