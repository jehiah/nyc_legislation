  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Declaration of legislative intent and findings. The council finds that it should be the policy of this city to promote the dignified and fair treatment of persons in the criminal justice system and in other institutions of confinement. The council declares that the use of outmoded terms, including \"inmate\" and \"prisoner,\" to refer to persons in custody in the criminal justice system and other institutions, is dehumanizing and demeaning to such persons, and that such terms should be eliminated from use in local law and replaced with terms that emphasize persons first, and not their circumstances. Through the elimination and replacement of such terminology, the council does not intend to alter the substantive meaning of the affected provisions of local law.\n      � 2.

Such report and plan shall also identify obstacles to making such services available to all those who need them and describe what additional resources would be necessary to do so. \n      � 3.
