  "Summary": "The recently expired local law required the commissioner of environmental protection to submit semi-annual reports of the citywide catch basin inspection, cleanup, maintenance and repair, by community board and to also ensure that catch basins are inspected, at a minimum of, once every year and are repaired or unclogged at least five days after inspection or the receipt of a complaint about a clogged or malfunctioning catch basin. The new local law would extended the expired law to still require that catch basins are inspected, at least, once every year and are repaired or unclogged at least five days after inspection or the receipt of a complaint about a clogged or malfunctioning catch basin.  The new law would require quarterly reports, remove the sunset provision and take effect immediately.",
