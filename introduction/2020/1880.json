  "Summary": "The proposed legislation would require day care services to make confirmed contact with parents or legal guardians in cases of unexpected absences. When a parent or legal guardian cannot be reached, day care services would be required to document that no less than three attempts were made to reach all contacts for the parents or legal guardians on file. Furthermore, day care services would be required to have at least two emergency contacts, in addition to the contacts for the parents or legal guardians, on file. When parents or legal guardians cannot be reached, day care service would be required to try to contact all emergency contacts on file.",
