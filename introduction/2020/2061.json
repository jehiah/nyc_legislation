  "Summary": "This bill would prohibit the operation of a moped share system without Department of Transportation (DOT) approval. Moped share system operators would be required to obtain a permit for each moped in their fleet. The bill would require DOT to promulgate rules on safety and rider compliance with law, including measures to monitor helmet use. The bill also limits moped share systems to mopeds incapable of exceeding 30 miles per hour, and creates penalties and provides for the impoundment of unauthorized mopeds.",
