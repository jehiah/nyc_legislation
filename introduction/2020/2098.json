Entities of 50 employees or fewer that were impacted by service limitations due to COVID-19, or which lost revenue, would be eligible for the grant.  SBS would be required to conduct outreach to minority- and women-owned businesses, including creating and submitting a plan detailing how the City will inform as many minority- and women-owned businesses as possible of the existence of the grant program; appointing an SBS staff member to liaise with minority and women business owners; and reporting to the Mayor and Speaker of the Council on each business that received a grant, including whether the business was a minority- and women-owned business.","TextID":69140,"Text":"Int.
