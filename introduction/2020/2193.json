  "Summary": "The proposed legislation would require the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications to conduct an assessment of the feasibility of transferring city agencies’ electronic data to the cloud computing systems.

For the purposes of this section, the term \"department\" means the department of information technology and telecommunications.\n      b.
