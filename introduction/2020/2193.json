  "Summary": "The proposed legislation would require the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications to conduct an assessment of the feasibility of transferring city agencies’ electronic data to the cloud computing systems. The Department would also be required to submit a report of the results of the assessment to the Council.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection 1. Assessment of the feasibility of storing city agencies' electronic data on cloud computing systems. \n      a. Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the term \"department\" means the department of information technology and telecommunications.\n      b. The department shall conduct an assessment to determine the feasibility of storing city agency electronic data at rest on cloud computing systems, rather than on physical data storage systems owned by the city. \n      c. No later than September 1, 2021, the department shall submit to the speaker of the council a report of the results of the assessment conducted pursuant to subdivision b of this section. Such report shall include, but not be limited to, the following:\n      1. an establishment of data classification categories for use with cloud computing services, including an inventory of the various data types;\n      2. an analysis of the feasibility and security of storing data from each data classification category on the cloud, including the legal implications, if any;\n      3. an analysis of the feasibility of transitioning legacy systems to utilize the cloud;\n      4. an analysis of any implications related to current software licenses; \n      5. an estimate of the costs, per unit of data, of storing, retrieving, and removing data from the average cloud computing system;\n      6. potential cost differentials, in both personal services and other than personal services costs, between physical data storage and cloud storage; \n      7. a brief analysis of the prospective cloud computing service providers, including a description of their physical principal places of business; and\n      8. recommendations on the requirements that a prospective cloud computing service provider should meet, such as on the physical data center location, the physical security of the data center, the deployment model of the cloud computing system, the disaster recovery strategy, the mechanics of reporting a security breach, the data duplication process utilized, the level of encryption utilized, the financial stability of the provider, the auto-deletion options, suggested auditing protocols, and any terms that a contract with a cloud computing service provider should include, such as an indemnification clause. \n      � 2.
