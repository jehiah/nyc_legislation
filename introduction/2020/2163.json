This bill would allow restaurants to impose a “Food Service Establishment Surcharge” of up to 15 percent of a customer’s total bill, as long as restaurants pay their tipped workers a cash wage that is not less than the City’s minimum wage of $15 per hour. Tips received by such workers would not be credited towards the hourly cash wage. The surcharge would have to be clearly disclosed on the menu, final bill and receipt, and the disclosure must be explicit that the additional charge is not a gratuity.","TextID":69402,"Text":"Int.
