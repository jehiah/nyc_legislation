  "Summary": "The proposed legislation would require the Police Department, within 24 hours of a determination that a violent or traumatic incident has occurred, to notify the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (“DOHMH”) of such incident. A violent or traumatic incident means an act or series of acts causing serious physical injury or death, including but not limited to gun violence or suicide. Upon receiving notice of a violent or traumatic incident, DOHMH would be required to conduct outreach to affected community members regarding the availability of mental health counseling and other social services from City agencies and City-funded non-governmental organizations.",
