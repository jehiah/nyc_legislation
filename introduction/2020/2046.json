  "Summary": "This local law would clarify and codify the existing requirement and practice of the mayor issuing capital commitment plans and capital project detail reports. The current language of the Charter does not clearly delineate the requirements and timelines of the two distinct reports that are produced. This local law would require that capital commitment plans be issued three times a year (within 90 days of the adopted budget and with submission of the preliminary and executive budgets). The capital commitment plans must include for the relevant fiscal years appropriations and planned commitments by project type; planned commitments by agency; for each capital project, as applicable, a description of such project, the schedule of planned commitments, available appropriations, expenditures and the current milestone associated with such project; and commitments by project type and total expenditures for the prior four fiscal years. The capital project detail reports, which are periodic reports on the progress of capital projects, would also be issued three times a year (within 120 days of the adopted budget and within 30 days of the submission of the preliminary and executive budgets).",
