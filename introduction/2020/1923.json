As used in this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings:\n      Discharge. The term \"discharge\" means any cessation of employment, including termination, constructive discharge, reduction in hours and indefinite suspension.\n      Essential business. The term \"essential business\" means any person or entity so defined by the New York state department of economic development in accordance with executive order 202.6 as issued by the governor on March 18, 2020 and extended thereafter.\n      Essential employee. The term \"essential employee\" means any person employed or permitted to work at or for an essential business. \n      Essential employer. The term \"essential employer\" means any employer that employs a person or permits a person to work at or for an essential business.\n      Just cause. The term \"just cause\" means sufficient cause for discharging an essential employee, such as the employee's failure to satisfactorily perform job duties or employee misconduct that is demonstrably and materially harmful to the essential employer's business interests.\n      Probation period. The term \"probation period\" means a period of time set by an essential employer, not to exceed 30 days from the time of hire of an essential employee, in which the essential employer and essential employee are free, at any time, with or without notice and with or without just cause, to end the employment relationship.\n      Progressive discipline. The term \"progressive discipline\" means a disciplinary system that provides a graduated range of reasonable responses to an essential employee's failure to satisfactorily perform such employee's job duties, with the disciplinary measures ranging from mild to severe, depending on the frequency and degree of the failure. Nothing herein shall preclude an essential employer from terminating an essential employee immediately for a failure or misconduct constituting just cause.\n      Reduction in hours. The term \"reduction in hours\" means a reduction in an essential employee's hours of work totaling at least 15 percent of the employee's weekly work schedule.\n      � 20-1272 Prohibition of wrongful discharge. An essential employer shall not discharge an essential employee who has completed such essential employer's probation period without just cause.\n      � 20-1273 Administrative enforcement. a. In addition to section 20-1207, in determining whether an essential employee has been terminated for just cause, the office shall consider, in addition to any other relevant factors, whether:\n      1. The essential employee knew or should have known of the essential employer's policy, rule or practice;\n      2. The essential employer provided relevant and adequate training to the essential employee;\n      3. The essential employer's policy, rule or practice was reasonable and applied consistently; and\n      4. The essential employer undertook a fair and objective investigation.\n      b. A termination shall not be considered based on just cause unless the essential employer has utilized progressive discipline; provided, however, that the employer may not rely on discipline issued more than one year before the purported just cause termination.\n      c. The essential employer shall provide a written explanation, including any non-hearsay evidence to support the decision, to any terminated essential employee of the precise reasons for the just cause termination within one week of termination. In determining whether an essential employer had just cause for termination, the office may not consider any reasons not included in such written explanation.\n      d. The essential employer shall bear the burden of proving just cause by a preponderance of non-hearsay evidence in any proceeding brought pursuant to this chapter.\n      � 20-1274 Private cause of action. a. An essential employee covered by this subchapter may bring a civil action, in accordance with applicable law, in any court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to section 20-1211. \n      b.

The essential employer shall provide a written explanation, including any non-hearsay evidence to support the decision, to any terminated essential employee of the precise reasons for the just cause termination within one week of termination. In determining whether an essential employer had just cause for termination, a fact finder may not consider any reasons not included in such written explanation.\n      e. The essential employer shall bear the burden of proving just cause by a preponderance of non-hearsay evidence in any proceeding brought pursuant to this chapter.\n      f. In addition to remedies that may be ordered pursuant to section 20-1211, a court of competent jurisdiction shall also order reasonable attorney's fees and costs for violations of this subchapter.\n      � 20-1275 Arbitration. a. Except as otherwise provided by law, any person claiming to be aggrieved by an essential employer's violation of this chapter may bring an arbitration proceeding, including on a class or collective basis, for back pay and benefits and other damages, including punitive damages, for reinstatement, restoration of hours, and other injunctive relief, and for such other remedies as may be appropriate. In an arbitration proceeding brought pursuant to this section, if the arbitrator finds in favor of the plaintiff, it shall award such person, in addition to other relief, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.\n      b.

The office shall provide translation services to any party requiring such services for the arbitration hearing.\n      h. The arbitration hearing shall be held at a location designated by the office. Such arbitration shall be subject to the labor arbitration rules established by the American arbitration association.\n      i. If an essential employee brings an arbitration proceeding, arbitration shall be the exclusive remedy for the wrongful discharge dispute and there is no right to bring or continue a private cause of action or administrative complaint under this chapter, unless such arbitration proceeding has been withdrawn or dismissed without prejudice.\n      j.
