  "Summary": "Due to the government mandated emergency closures of several businesses due to the COVID-19 outbreak, many holders of city-issued licenses were prohibited from carrying out licensed activity. This bill requires city agencies to provide a one-time waiver of renewal fees for any license holder that could not work for a period of 30 days or more due to an emergency executive order during the COVID-19 state of emergency. City agencies responsible for renewing such licenses must provide information on the fee waiver on their websites. Likewise, the Mayor must provide to the Council a list of all occupational licenses that are eligible for a fee waiver within 30 days of the effective date of this local law.",
