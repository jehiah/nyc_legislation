  "Summary": "The bill would amend the New York City Fire Code by exempting machines used to resurface ice (frequently referred to as “Zambonis” for the inventor, Frank Zamboni) from current requirements that prohibit certain powered industrial machines from utilizing more than one canister of propane. Under the new provision, a Zamboni would be permitted to utilize two propane canisters at any given time.",
