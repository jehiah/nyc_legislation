  "Summary": "This bill would amend existing requirements for certain city agencies to collect demographic data about ancestry and languages spoken, multiracial ancestry or ethnic origin, and gender identity and sexual orientation so that the requirement would be extended to any agency that collects demographic data on forms from city residents. In addition, these demographic questions would have to be incorporated into any existing forms of these agencies that include demographic questions unless there is a law or court order preventing the amendment of any such form. If there is a law or court order preventing amendment of a form but there is a waiver available allowing amendment, the agency would be required to request a waiver.",
