  "Summary": "Third-party food delivery services are entities that provide restaurants with online order and delivery services. This bill would amend an existing law limiting third-party food delivery service fees under certain circumstances. Under the existing law, third-party food delivery services are prohibited from charging restaurants more than 15% per order for delivery and more than 5% per order for all other fees during states of emergency when on-premises dining is prohibited entirely, plus an additional 90 days thereafter. This bill would instead limit such fees during states of emergency when restaurants are restricted from operating at maximum indoor occupancy, plus an additional 90 days thereafter. In addition, this bill would exempt from the 5% limit on non-delivery fees, any fees incurred by the third-party delivery service for processing the customer transaction for which the third-party service acts as a “pass-through” by charging such fees to the restaurant.",

It shall be unlawful for a third-party food delivery service to charge a food service establishment any fee [or fees] other than a delivery fee for the use of their service greater than 5% of the purchase price of each online order, provided that such cap shall not apply to a credit card fee that is charged to the third-party food delivery service and is charged in the same amount by the third-party food delivery service to such food service establishment. [Any fees or other charges from a third-party food delivery service to a food service establishment beyond such maximum 5% fee per order, and a delivery fee collected pursuant to subdivision a of this section, are unlawful.] \n      c.
