  "Summary": "This bill would require the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to track and issue a report on the mental health of New Yorkers during the COVID-19 public health emergency. The report would be published every 6 months and would include: the number of 311 calls relating to mental health; the number of 911 calls relating to mental health emergencies and substance misuse or overdoses; the number of calls received by any mental health hotline maintained by the department or by another agency; the number of hospital admissions for overdoses or that were substance use-related; and any other information regarding the mental health of New Yorkers during the COVID-19 public health emergency that the Commissioner of Health deems appropriate. The information required in this report would be disaggregated by age, race, gender, zip code and any other demographic category that the department deems relevant, to the extent such demographic information is available. Additionally, on an annual basis, the report would include a description of any trends in adverse mental health of New Yorkers during the COVID-19 public health emergency and any steps taken by DOHMH to address such trends.",
