  "Summary": "The bill would establish protections for displaced hotel service workers in the event of a change in control of a hotel, such as a sale or bankruptcy. Once new ownership commences, the owner would be required to provide employment to the existing hotel workers for at least 90 days. During this retention period, existing workers would be paid the same wage rate or higher. At the end of the 90-day period, the new employer would perform an evaluation of the worker and, if the worker receives a satisfactory result, the new employer would be required to offer continued employment. In addition, the bill would require hotels to notify guests of service disruptions that would substantially affect their stay. A hotel would be prohibited from charging a fee or penalty for cancellations made because of a service disruption.",
