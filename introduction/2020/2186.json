  "Summary": "This bill would create a ten-year comprehensive planning cycle connecting budget, land use, and strategic planning processes. The cycle would include a review of City conditions, including racial and socio-economic disparities, access to opportunity, displacement risk, short- and long- term risks, impacts of prior development and budget decisions, and current and projected infrastructure needs. A Citywide Goals Statement would set targets for housing, jobs, open space, resiliency infrastructure, City facilities, schools, transportation, public utilities, and other infrastructure.  The plan would include: (1) strategic policies for achieving Citywide goals; (2) an analysis of the Zoning Resolution and recommended changes; (3) District Level Targets to distribute growth, infrastructure, amenities, and services equitably; (4) Community District land use scenarios; and (5) Community District budget needs. Council adoption of the plan and extensive outreach would be required.",
