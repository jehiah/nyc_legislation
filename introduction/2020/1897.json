  "Summary": "This bill would require third-party food delivery services to obtain a license in order to do business in the City. It would also repeal the subchapter in the Administrative Code that contains existing laws regulating third-party food delivery services, and would instead incorporate the requirements of recently passed Introductions 2311-A, 2333-A, 2335-A and 2356-A into this bill’s licensing scheme. Under the bill, the department could deny or refuse to renew a license, or suspend or revoke a license, if a third-party food delivery service committed two of more violations of the bill’s subchapter. Third-party food delivery services who violate the requirements in the bill’s subchapter would also be subject to civil penalties, as well as civil action from the City or a person against whom a violation was committed. The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection would be required to conduct outreach on the provisions of this bill.",
