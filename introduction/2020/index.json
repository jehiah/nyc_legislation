Landlords, owners, agents, employees, and real estate brokers would be prohibited from obtaining criminal record information at any stage in the process. These entities would be able to take adverse actions against current occupants for reasons other than a person’s arrest record or criminal history, as long as they are complying with laws protecting victims of domestic violence, sex offenses, or stalking. Where federal, state, or local laws, rules or regulations require exclusion based on criminal history or require a criminal background check for eligibility, this section does not apply. This section also does not prohibit inquiries into the NY sex offender registry, but requires that the landlord, owner, agents and brokers provide the applicant written notice about the inquiry, and a reasonable amount of time, not more than 3 days, to withdraw the application. The bill also outlines a fair housing process for applicants to dispute an adverse action based on arrest record or criminal history. This bill does not apply to two-family owner-occupied housing or rooms in owner-occupied housing. Covered entities would not be liable under other laws for complying with this law.","LastModified":"2021-12-10T21:00:46.31Z"}

This bill would amend an existing law limiting third-party food delivery service fees under certain circumstances. Under the existing law, third-party food delivery services are prohibited from charging restaurants more than 15% per order for delivery and more than 5% per order for all other fees during states of emergency when on-premises dining is prohibited entirely, plus an additional 90 days thereafter. This bill would instead limit such fees during states of emergency when restaurants are restricted from operating at maximum indoor occupancy, plus an additional 90 days thereafter. In addition, this bill would exempt from the 5% limit on non-delivery fees, any fees incurred by the third-party delivery service for processing the customer transaction for which the third-party service acts as a “pass-through” by charging such fees to the restaurant.","LastModified":"2020-11-10T17:45:29.347Z"}

The term “remote learning” means a system, implemented in lieu of in-person instruction during and as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, that allows teachers to deliver their lessons online, and students to complete assignments, projects, and assessments remotely just as they would in the physical classroom. Remote learning can occur synchronously with real-time teacher-to-student interaction and collaboration, or asynchronously, with self-paced learning activities that take place independently of the teacher.","LastModified":"2021-03-08T18:01:25.577Z"}
