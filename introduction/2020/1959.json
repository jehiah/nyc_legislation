Affiliated within the Office, there would be an Advisory Board chosen from the public, private and non-profit sectors, as well as from higher education institutions and sports institutions located in the city to advise the director of the Office in furthering its mission. The Office would regularly consult with various City agencies in performing its duties and would submit an annual report advising to the Mayor and Council on its activities and recommendations.",
