  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Small Business Services to prepare a report detailing which businesses received a grant or loan from the New York City Employee Retention Program or New York City Small Business Continuity Loan Fund, both created to help small businesses with revenue losses because of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19. For each business that received a grant or loan, the report would include the Council District, zip code, industry type including whether the recipient is a mobile business, and the amount of grant or loan received by the business. SBS would submit the report to the Mayor and Speaker of the City Council and make the information publicly available by posting the report on its website.",
