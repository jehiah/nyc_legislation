  "Summary": "This bill would amend the New York City Charter to expand the number of New York City agencies required to provide all of their employees with trainings on implicit bias, discrimination, cultural competency and structural inequity. The training required would address inequities with respect to gender, race and sexual orientation, and how these factors impact the work of such agencies.  As a conforming amendment, this bill would also repeal the existing equity training requirement for City employees in section 3-161 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York, which was enacted to apply only with respect to certain specified City agencies. The new provision would expand on the existing training requirement to apply to many more City agencies and would be located in the New York City Charter, to be placed with other existing provisions on citywide employee training requirements.",
