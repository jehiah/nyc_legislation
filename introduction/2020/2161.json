The board would hold two public hearings a year to solicit testimony from employees, relevant experts, and stakeholders and make recommendations on protocols for future public health emergencies based on an assessment of the testimony and any submitted guidance. The board would consist of 9 members: the Commissioners of Health and Mental Hygiene, Citywide Administrative Services, Consumer and Worker Protection, and Office of Labor Relations; two Mayoral appointees; two appointees by the Speaker of the Council; and one appointee by the Public Advocate. The board would submit a preliminary report after the first hearing and, by December 15, 2021, a final report to the Mayor and Speaker of the Council. The board would dissolve 180 days after submission of the final report.","TextID":69638,"Text":"Int.
