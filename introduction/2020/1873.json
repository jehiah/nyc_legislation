  "Summary": "This bill would create a New York City standard for mercury vapor exposure on sites adjacent to schools, child care facilities, or facilities providing day care services. This standard would be 750 nanograms per cubic meter of air, averaged over an eight-hour work shift of a 40-hour work week for adults or 16 hours or less per week averaged over the school year for children. The bill would also require the Commissioner of Environmental Protection to develop a procedure for property owners to identify the presence of elemental mercury on a property, and would require the Commissioner to create mercury vapor remediation standards for owners of properties located adjacent to schools, child care facilities, or facilities providing day care services.",

Determining presence of mercury. Before the commencement of any foundation work or earthwork requiring the filing of an application pursuant to section 28-105.2.1, the owner of the covered property that will undergo such work shall analyze available public records to determine whether any industrial or commercial activity involving a use of elemental mercury has ever taken place on the property.

Testing. When the owner of a covered property has determined that industrial or commercial activity involving a use of elemental mercury has taken place on the property and has determined the likely presence of mercury on the property pursuant to subdivision a of this section, such owner shall test for the actual presence of elemental mercury on the property.\n      c.

Such notice or order may be given orally or in writing to the owner of the property involved, the owner's agent or the persons performing the work and may require all persons in or about the building or premises to vacate the same immediately, and also may require such work to be done as, in the opinion of the commissioner, may be necessary to remove the danger therefrom.\n      g. Variance. The commissioner may grant an individual variance from a requirement of this subchapter or rules promulgated thereunder, or from an order of the commissioner related to remediation of elemental mercury, upon presentation of adequate proof that compliance with such requirement or order would cause unreasonable hardship. In granting a variance, the commissioner may impose reasonable conditions in furtherance of the policies of this subchapter. No later than seven days after granting such a variance, the commissioner shall publish online and in the City Record a statement of the reasons the variance was granted.\n      h. Information sharing. The commissioner, in consultation with the commissioner of buildings, shall establish a procedure for sharing information about violations issued pursuant to this section, in accordance with the requirements of section 28-103.7.1.\n      i. Rules for non-remediation projects.
