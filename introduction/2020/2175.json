  "Summary": "This bill would require the New York City Board of Elections to publish the unofficial tally of election results for ranked choice voting (RCV) elections in the form of round-by-round tallies, tabulated pursuant to the RCV tabulation procedures of the Charter. This would ensure that the unofficial results are reported in the same format as the final results. It is designed to add transparency to the RCV tabulation process and give voters confidence in the legitimacy of RCV election results.",
