  "Summary": "This bill would require that, if any public health authority or organization provides notification of the spread of a highly transmissible disease (that is, a disease that spreads through respiratory droplets or aerosols and for which no vaccine is available) that is a serious threat to public health anywhere in the world, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) would be required to publish guidelines advising as to measures to prevent the spread of such a disease. In addition, if the Governor or the Mayor declares a state of emergency, or the Commissioner of DOHMH declares a public health emergency, due to the spread of a highly transmissible disease, mass gatherings would be prohibited, subject to exceptions designated by the Commissioner of DOHMH, until the Commissioner of DOHMH determines that such a prohibition is not necessary to protect public health.",
