  "Summary": "This local law would amend previously enacted local laws to add a study of building electrification in New York City. As part of the building electrification study this local law would consider regulatory barriers to building electrification; lack of both customer awareness and workforce familiarity with electrification, costs for property owners, time frames for electrification consistent with state and local greenhouse gas reduction goals and an assessment of the renewable energy sources that would be needed to meet any increase in demand caused by the electrification of existing buildings.  The study shall also consider equity and access to inclusive financing for property owners as well as tenant protection from property rental increases.",

Plans for providing information to city residents and other members of the public regarding energy efficiency initiatives and the purchase of renewable energy;\n      2. Plans for the dissemination of information to city residents and other members of the public about the benefits of and progress attained through such long-term energy plan; [and]\n      3. Plans for providing information to property owners, engineers, electricians, architects and other members of the public on the methods and potential benefits of the electrification of existing buildings; and\n      4.

The long-term energy plan developed in accordance with subdivision d of this section shall include the following:\n      1. An assessment of the feasibility of replacing in-city gas-fired power plants associated with the bulk power system with battery storage powered by renewable energy sources in a manner that is consistent with the New York state public service commission energy storage deployment policy developed pursuant to section 74 of the public service law;\n      2. An assessment of when such replacement, if feasible, can take place; [and]\n      3. A review of potential technologies for battery storage of energy[.];\n      4. A review of the regulatory barriers to the electrification of existing buildings and the impacts of energy subsidies, including consideration of the impacts of utility franchise agreements, gas subsidies such as for gas line extensions, appliance emission standards, and energy rates;\n      5. An assessment of the potential costs for property owners of the electrification of existing buildings, including consideration of buildings of various types and sizes;\n      6. An assessment of possible time frames for the electrification of existing buildings of various types and sizes, including consideration of both the energy demands required and state and local greenhouse gas reduction goals;\n      7. An assessment of the potential equity impacts of the electrification of existing buildings, including considerations of property owner access to financing, and potential financial impacts on tenants; and\n      8.
