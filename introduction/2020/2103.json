  "Summary": "This bill would require certain stores that sell food for off-premises consumption, such as grocery stores, to post notices on the food donation web portal regarding excess food they have available for donation, at least once per month. Stores would also be required to arrange for the retrieval of the food that they are donating, and to arrange for the transportation of such food if requested by the recipient. The bill would also exempt stores that would normally be subject to the requirements of this law if they have agreements in place for the donation of food on at least a monthly basis. By December 1 of each year, the Department of Sanitation or other City entity designated by the Mayor, would be required to submit to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council a report detailing the results of a yearly review of available food on the web portal and whether that available food is expected to meet the demands of city residents in the coming year.",

Definitions. For the purposes of this chapter, the following terms have the following meanings: \n      Excess food. The term \"excess food\" means food that (i) meets all quality and labeling standards imposed by federal, state, and local laws and regulations even though the food may not be readily marketable due to appearance, age, freshness, grade, size, surplus, or other conditions; (ii) is not required to meet the needs of a retail food store; and (iii) would otherwise be discarded.\n      Retail food store. The term \"retail food store\" means any establishment in the city where food and food products offered to the consumer are intended for off-premises consumption, but excludes convenience stores, pharmacies, greenmarkets or farmers' markets and food service establishments.\n      b. Within eighteen months after the effective date of the local law that added this section, the department or another agency or office designated by the mayor, shall, in conjunction with the department of information technology and telecommunications, create or modify and maintain a web portal that will allow prospective food donors and recipients, including but not limited to restaurants, grocery stores, produce markets, dining facilities and food rescue organizations, to post [notifications] notices concerning the availability of food, including food that would otherwise go to waste, and to arrange for the transportation or retrieval of such food. Such portal shall, at a minimum, allow (i) a prospective food donor to describe the type and amount of food available, including any information necessary to keep the food safe for human consumption, such as refrigeration requirements, as well as other information necessary to facilitate its donation, (ii) a prospective food recipient to specify the type and amount of food donations it will accept and the areas of the city from which it will accept donations and to receive prompt notification concerning the availability of food satisfying such specifications, and (iii) a prospective food donor and a prospective food recipient to communicate directly through a messaging system within such portal. \n      c. Each retail food store that has a floor area of at least fifteen thousand square feet, or that is part of a chain of three or more retail food stores that have a combined floor area of at least fifteen thousand square feet and that operate under common ownership and control, with excess food available, shall, at least once a month:\n      1.

The commissioner shall enforce the requirements of subdivision c of this section. A retail food store that would otherwise be subject to the requirements of subdivision c of this section that fails to comply with such subdivision shall be subject to a penalty of no more than $10,000 for each month during which such retail food store failed to post a required notice. The commissioner shall investigate any retail food store that has not posted notices offering excess food for at least six months out of the previous 12 months.\n      f. No later than December 1 of each year, the commissioner or another agency or office designated by the mayor, shall conduct a review of all notices concerning available, excess food posted to the food web portal within the past year; shall assess, in its discretion, to what extent such notices would meet the estimated demand for food from city residents likely to suffer from hunger in the next year; and shall submit a report detailing the results of such review and assessment to the mayor and the speaker of the council.\n      g. The commissioner or another agency or office designated by the mayor shall promulgate rules to implement the requirements of this section. \n      � 2.
