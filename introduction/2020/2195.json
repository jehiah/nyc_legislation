  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Cultural Affairs to establish a process by which artists, other than those who are applying for certification for the purpose of using a joint living-working space, could also apply to become recognized as certified artists. In addition, a certified artist would be eligible to obtain a New York City identity card which would display the cardholder’s status as a certified artist.",
