  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation (“DOT”) to operate an open streets program, which would provide street space to pedestrians and other non-vehicular street users. Under this program, open streets could be managed by DOT or by community organizations. The bill would create a process by which community organizations could apply to operate an open street, require that DOT manage or provide resources to at least 20 open streets sites in areas that would be otherwise underserved by the program, and require that DOT provide resources to other open streets as available. DOT would also annually evaluate open streets to determine whether to apply further design changes, such as a conversion to a shared street or pedestrian plaza.",
