  "Summary": "This bill would raise the current expenditure threshold for requiring registration of certain New York City lobbyists from $5,000 to $10,000.  Under the legislation, certain lobbyists with annual expenditures or anticipated expenditures of $10,000 or less for lobbying the City would be relieved of various administrative requirements, such as filing a registration statement and submitting bi-monthly reports to the City Clerk.",
