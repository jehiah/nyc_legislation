  "Summary": "This bill would give the Mayor’s Office of Media and Entertainment (MOME) sole authority to issue, suspend, and revoke press credentials. MOME would be required to establish rules setting forth criteria for press credential issuance, suspension, and revocation. Any person whose application for a press credential is denied would be entitled to a hearing. In addition, a hearing would be required before any press credential could be seized, suspended, or revoked. All hearings would be conducted by the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings (OATH) in accordance with the due process procedures of the Charter and the OATH rules. Press credentials previously issued by the Police Department would remain in effect until their expiration date or until 270 days after the effective date of this local law, whichever is later.",
