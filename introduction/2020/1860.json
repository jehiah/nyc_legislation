  "Summary": "The proposed bill would expand the scope of Local Law 50 of 2019 in relation to the number of pedestrian countdown displays at city intersections. The bill would require that a countdown display be placed at every possible intersection where a traffic-control signal is located. Currently, Local Law 50 of 2019 only provides for a pedestrian countdown display where a traffic-control signal photo violation-monitoring system also exists. The bill would also require the submission of a ten year plan to the speaker of the council detailing projected costs and a timeline for installations.",
