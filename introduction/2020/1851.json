  "Summary": "This local law amends the administrative code, the plumbing code and the building code as it pertains to construction projects intended to reduce the flow of stormwater and waterborne pollutants into sewers that empty directly into the waters of the state or overflow into such waters due to rain or snowmelt events that exceed the capacity of the wastewater treatment plants.  This local law is also intended to address the city municipal separate storm sewer system.  For MS4 projects, this local law will ensure that the rules for such projects are not less stringent than the NYC MS4 permit and the NYSDEC Construction general permit.",
  "TextID": 68094,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n      Section 1.  Section 24-540 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 97 for the year 2017, is amended to read as follows:\n            � 24-540 Policy. Land development and associated increases in site impervious cover increase stormwater runoff causing flooding, soil erosion, and sediment transport and deposition in waterways. A high percentage of impervious area correlates with a higher rate of stormwater runoff, which generates greater pollutant loadings to the city's separate stormwater and combined sewer systems. Pollutants found in urban runoff include, but are not limited to, nitrogen, phosphorus, silt and sediment, pathogens, floatables, petroleum hydrocarbons, heavy metals, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).\n             Clearing and grading during construction may increase soil erosion and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitats. Improperly designed and constructed stormwater management practices increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing erosion and sedimentation. Impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow. Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff from land development activities. Regulation of land development activities by means of performance standards governing long-term stormwater management and site design produces development compatible with the natural functions of a particular site and thereby mitigates the adverse effects of erosion and sedimentation from development.\n             Material handling and storage, equipment maintenance and cleaning, and other activities at industrial facilities are often exposed to stormwater, which can pick up pollutants and transport them to surface waters directly or via a storm sewer. Appropriate stormwater management at industrial facilities can reduce these impacts.\n            This chapter establishes stormwater management controls [meeting the requirements of state and federal law in areas of the city where stormwater] for construction projects to reduce the flow of stormwater runoff and water borne pollutants into sewers that empty directly into the waters of the state or that overflow into such waters because of rain or snowmelt events that exceed the design capacity of wastewater treatment plants.  [In these areas water borne pollutants in stormwater runoff are more likely to enter and have an adverse impact on the waters of the state]. \n             The purpose and intent of this chapter is to (i) reduce pollutants discharged in stormwater runoff from construction activities [in such areas] to the maximum extent practicable through appropriate erosion and sediment controls; (ii) minimize, to the maximum extent practicable, increases in stormwater runoff volume and velocity, and pollutant loading in stormwater runoff, from development sites [in such areas] ; (iii) ensure the proper maintenance of post-construction stormwater management practices; and (iv) ensure compliance by certain industrial facilities [in such areas] served by the city separate storm sewer system with applicable requirements to manage stormwater runoff in order to reduce pollutants in stormwater from industrial activities to the maximum extent practicable.\n            �2.  The definitions of \"covered development project\", \"MS4 SWPPP acceptance form\", \"MS4 area\", \"notice of intent\" or \"NOI\", \"notice of termination\" or \"NOT\" and \"separate stormwater outfall\" in section 24-541 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 97 for the year 2017, are amended to read as follows:\n            Covered development project. The term \"covered development project\" means development activity that involves or results in an amount of soil disturbance [within the MS4 area] greater than or equal to one acre or as established pursuant to rules of the department in accordance with subdivision d of section 24-553.  Such term includes development activity that is part of a larger common plan of development or sale involving or resulting in soil disturbance [within the MS4 area] greater than or equal to one acre or as established pursuant to rules of the department in accordance with subdivision d of section 24-553.  [Such term shall include all development activity within the MS4 area that requires a stormwater pollution prevention plan pursuant to the NYSDEC construction general permit.]\n            [MS4 area.  The term \"MS4 area\" means those portions of the city of New York served by separate storm sewers and separate stormwater outfalls owned or operated by the city of New York and areas in which municipal operations and facilities drain by overland flow to waters of the state, as determined by the department and described on maps of the MS4 area set forth in the rules of the department. ]\n            Notice of intent or NOI.  The term \"notice of intent\" or \"NOI\" means for MS 4 projects the document submitted to NYSDEC to obtain coverage under the NYSDEC construction general permit.\n            Notice of termination or NOT.  The term \"notice of termination\" or \"NOT\" means for MS 4 projects the document submitted to NYSDEC to terminate coverage under the NYSDEC construction general permit.\n            MS4 SWPPP acceptance form.  The term \"MS4 SWPPP acceptance form\" means for MS 4 projects the form developed by NYSDEC to be used to indicate acceptance of a SWPPP by a municipality.\n            [Separate stormwater outfall.  The term \"separate stormwater outfall\" means a point where stormwater from a storm sewer or other source of concentrated stormwater flow, owned or operated by the city of New York, is discharged into a water of the state or to a separate storm sewer system that requires coverage under the NYSDEC MS4 general permit.]\n            �3.  Section 24-521 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding new definitions of \"MS4\" and \"MS4 covered development project\" or \"MS 4 project\" in alphabetical order to read as follows:\n            MS4.  The term \"MS4\" means the city municipal separate storm sewer system.\n            MS4 covered development project or MS 4 project.  The term \" MS4 covered development project\" or \"MS 4 project\" means a covered development project that is subject to the NYSDEC construction general permit. \n      �4. Sections 24-550, 24-552, 24-553, 24-554, 24-557, 24-559, 24-560 and 24-570 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 97 for the year 2017, are amended to read as follows:\n      �24-550 General.  This subchapter [governs certain] regulates land development activities [within the MS4 area] of covered development projects.\n\t�24-552 Review of stormwater pollution prevention plan or SWPPP.  Before the commencement of development activity on the site of a covered development project the developer must submit [a copy of the notice of intent and] a stormwater pollution prevention plan, certified by a qualified professional, to the department for review in accordance with the rules of the department and for MS 4 projects a copy of the notice of intent.  The department or a qualified professional designated by the department shall review the SWPPP within time periods to be specified in the rules of the department.

Land development and associated increases in site impervious cover increase stormwater runoff causing flooding, soil erosion, and sediment transport and deposition in waterways. A high percentage of impervious area correlates with a higher rate of stormwater runoff, which generates greater pollutant loadings to the city's separate stormwater and combined sewer systems. Pollutants found in urban runoff include, but are not limited to, nitrogen, phosphorus, silt and sediment, pathogens, floatables, petroleum hydrocarbons, heavy metals, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).\\par\n\\emspace Clearing and grading during construction may increase soil erosion and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitats. Improperly designed and constructed stormwater management practices increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing erosion and sedimentation. Impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow. Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff from land development activities. Regulation of land development activities by means of performance standards governing long-term stormwater management and site design produces development compatible with the natural functions of a particular site and thereby mitigates the adverse effects of erosion and sedimentation from development.\\par\n\\emspace Material handling and storage, equipment maintenance and cleaning, and other activities at industrial facilities are often exposed to stormwater, which can pick up pollutants and transport them to surface waters directly or via a storm sewer. Appropriate stormwater management at industrial facilities can reduce these impacts.\\par\nThis chapter establishes stormwater management controls [meeting the requirements of state and federal law in areas of the city where stormwater] \\ul for construction projects\\ulnone  \\ul to reduce the flow of stormwater runoff and water borne pollutants into sewers that empty directly into the waters of the state or that overflow into such waters because of rain or snowmelt events that exceed the design capacity of wastewater treatment plants.\\ulnone   [In these areas water borne pollutants in stormwater runoff are more likely to enter and have an adverse impact on the waters of the state]. \\par\n\\emspace The purpose and intent of this chapter is to (i) reduce pollutants discharged in stormwater runoff from construction activities [in such areas] to the maximum extent practicable through appropriate erosion and sediment controls; (ii) minimize, to the maximum extent practicable, increases in stormwater runoff volume and velocity, and pollutant loading in stormwater runoff, from development sites [in such areas] ; (iii) ensure the proper maintenance of post-construction stormwater management practices; and (iv) ensure compliance by certain industrial facilities [in such areas] \\ul served by the city separate storm sewer system\\ulnone  with applicable requirements to manage stormwater runoff in order to reduce pollutants in stormwater from industrial activities to the maximum extent practicable.\\par\n\\pard\\ltrpar\\hyphpar0\\fi1440\\sl480\\slmult1\\'a72.
