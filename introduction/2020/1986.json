  "Summary": "The proposed legislation would require the Office of Burial Services, during any state of emergency declared by the Governor or the Mayor, to inform residents within 24 hours when any changes are made to burial policies in the City. The law would also require that a dedicated burial information hotline to be established during emergencies, such that individuals with burial-related questions or needs can access information directly, without going through 311.",
