  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Education (DOE) to publicly post on its website on a monthly basis student attendance data during the use of remote learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Remote Learning can occur synchronously with real-time teacher-to-student interaction and collaboration, or asynchronously, with self-paced learning activities that take place independently of the teacher. The data would be disaggregated by school, school district, grade, ethnicity and a number of other factors.",
