  "Summary": "This bill would permit pedestrians to legally cross a roadway outside of a marked or unmarked crosswalk as long as pedestrians yield to vehicle traffic and removes civil and criminal penalties for the offense commonly referred to as “jaywalking”.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1.

When pedestrian control signals are in operation, exhibiting symbols of a walking person, upraised hand, or upraised hand with a pedestrian countdown display, or any other internationally recognized representation concerning the movement of pedestrians, such signals shall indicate as follows: \n      1.   Steady walking person. Pedestrians facing such signal may proceed across the roadway in the direction of such signal, and other traffic shall yield the right of way to such pedestrians.\n      2.   Flashing upraised hand or flashing upraised hand with pedestrian countdown display. Pedestrians facing such signal are advised that there may be insufficient time to cross the roadway. Pedestrians already in the roadway [shall ] are advised to proceed to the nearest sidewalk or safety island in the direction of such signal. Other traffic shall yield the right of way to pedestrians proceeding across the roadway within the crosswalk towards such signal for as long as such signal remains flashing.\n      3.   Steady upraised hand.[No pedestrians shall start to cross the roadway in the direction of such signal] Pedestrians facing such a signal are advised that vehicle traffic has the right of way and pedestrians entering the roadway while this signal is displayed will be at risk of injury due to vehicle traffic; provided, however that any pedestrians who have partially completed their crossing on a steady walking person signal or any flashing upraised hand signal [shall] are advised to proceed to the nearest sidewalk or safety island in the direction of such signal while such steady upraised hand signal is showing.\n      b.
