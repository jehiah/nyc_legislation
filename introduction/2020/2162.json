If any such agency issues guidance about occupational safety and health related to the public health emergency, the Citywide Office of Occupational Safety would be required to email such guidance to the safety and health coordinator at each city agency within 24 hours. Within 24 hours of receipt of such guidance, the safety and health coordinator would be required to post it in the workplace, email it to each employee of the agency and send a summary to each employee that is tailored based on employee’s position to highlight the most relevant information from the guidance. The coordinator would also be required to provide each employee any education or training required to ensure proper compliance with the most recent guidance.","TextID":69639,"Text":"Int.
