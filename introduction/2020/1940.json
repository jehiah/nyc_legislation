  "Summary": "This bill requires city agencies to publish a list of any licenses, permits, consents or registrations that are not covered by the renewal extension provided for by section four of the Mayor’s Emergency Executive Order Number 107 issued on April 14, 2020. This list must be made available on agency websites no later than 14 days after the enactment of this bill. In addition, this bill requires that all renewal deadlines be no earlier than 45 days after section four of the Mayor’s emergency order lapses. For licenses, permits, consents or registrations that expire on or after March 12, 2020 and are for a term of less than 45 days, the renewal extension provided for in this bill shall only be for the original duration of such license, permit, consent or registration.",
