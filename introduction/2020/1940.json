  "Summary": "This bill requires city agencies to publish a list of any licenses, permits, consents or registrations that are not covered by the renewal extension provided for by section four of the Mayor’s Emergency Executive Order Number 107 issued on April 14, 2020. This list must be made available on agency websites no later than 14 days after the enactment of this bill. In addition, this bill requires that all renewal deadlines be no earlier than 45 days after section four of the Mayor’s emergency order lapses. For licenses, permits, consents or registrations that expire on or after March 12, 2020 and are for a term of less than 45 days, the renewal extension provided for in this bill shall only be for the original duration of such license, permit, consent or registration.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      Section 1. a. The mayor or his designee shall publish a list of any license, permit, consent or registration issued by a city agency that, to the extent reasonably ascertained by the mayor or such designee, is not within the scope of section 4 of the mayor's emergency executive order number 107, published April 14, 2020, as amended. Such list shall be published on the city's website no later than 14 days after the enactment of this local law.\n      b. An agency that administers any license, permit, consent or registration that has been extended by section 4 of the mayor's emergency executive order number 107, published April 14, 2020, as amended, shall not require such license, permit, consent or registration to be renewed for at least 45 days after it is no longer subject to such emergency executive order, during which time notice of the requirement to renew shall be provided on the website of such agency. Any such license, permit, consent or registration shall be deemed to be further extended during such time period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for any license, permit, consent or registration that expired or required renewal on or after March 12, 2020 and had a term of less than 45 days, the extension provided by this subdivision shall be for at least the term of such license, permit, consent or registration.\n      � 2.
