  "Summary": "This bill would require the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs to establish an anonymous hotline, website, or similar access point tracking suspected federal immigration enforcement activity. It would also require quarterly reporting on its usage.",
  "TextID": 68955,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows: \n       \n      Section 1. Section 18 of the New York city charter is amended by adding a new subsection h to read as follows: \n      h. Reporting immigration enforcement activity. 1. The commissioner, or such other person as the mayor designates, shall establish a phone number, website, or other publicly available access point to which persons can report suspected federal immigration enforcement activity. Such access point shall attempt to record, at a minimum, the locations and types of any such activity. Information so received shall be anonymous and confidential except to the extent required by any federal, state or other local law. No person utilizing such access point shall be asked for any identifying information, as defined in section 23-1201 of the administrative code. Users of such access point shall be provided with referrals to immigration legal resources where appropriate. \n      2. No later than December 31, 2021 and quarterly thereafter, the commissioner shall submit to the mayor and the speaker of the council a report regarding each usage of the access point described in paragraph 1 of this subdivision. Such report shall include a table in which each separate row references a unique usage. Each row shall include the following information, as well as any additional information the commissioner deems appropriate without compromising the caller's anonymity, set forth in separate columns:\n      (a) The date and time at which the access occurred;\n      (b) The nearest street corner to the location at which the suspected federal immigration enforcement activity occurred; and\n      (c) A summary of the suspected federal immigration enforcement activity reported.\n      � 2.
