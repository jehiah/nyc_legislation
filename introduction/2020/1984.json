Such plan would be required to include information regarding protocols and procedures for activation and implementation of such plan, strategies and tactics for hospitals to increase bed capacity, protocols to meet additional equipment and resource needs, and a mechanism to establish ongoing communication among hospitals, the New York City Emergency Management Department and other governmental agencies. The Commissioner would be required to assess the plan annually and submit copies of the plan and updated versions to the Council.","TextID":68783,"Text":"Int.
