  "Summary": "Currently, when the City performs sidewalk repair work on behalf of certain residential property owners those owners may enter into an installment agreement with the Department of Finance to pay back those charges over a period of time. However, such installment agreement may only be entered into when the charge for the work performed is between $250 and $5,000. This local law would eliminate the cap of $5,000 to enter into an installment agreement for the payment of work performed by the City for sidewalks and lots.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Subdivision m of section 19-152 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by local law number 67 for the year 1985, is amended to read as follows:\n      � 2. Upon application in writing of either (i) an owner of real property which is improved by a one, two, three, four, five or six family house: or (ii) an owner of real property which has an assessed valuation of no more than thirty thousand dollars, upon which a charge in excess of two hundred fifty dollars [but not in excess of five thousand dollars] has been entered pursuant to this section, the commissioner of finance may agree with the owner to divide the charge into four annual installments. Each installment shall be as nearly equal as may be. The first installment thereof shall be due and payable upon approval of the application and each succeeding installment shall be due and payable on the next ensuing anniversary date of the date of entry of the charge, together with interest thereon from the date of entry at the rate determined pursuant to subdivision p, or at the rate of eight and one-half percent per annum, whichever is lower. The commissioner may require owners of parcels making application pursuant to this subdivision to furnish satisfactory proof of their eligibility. In the event that the owner fails to make payment of any installment within thirty days of the due date, the commissioner may declare such installment agreement to be null and void and the balance of the charge shall become immediately due and payable with interest at the rate prescribed in subdivision j of this section to be calculated from the date of entry to the date of payment. The installments not yet due with interest to date of payment may be paid at any time. The city may not enforce a lien against any owner who has entered into an agreement with the commissioner of finance pursuant to this section provided that he or she is not in default thereunder. No installment shall be a lien or deemed an encumbrance upon the title to real property charged until it becomes due as herein provided. In the event that the city shall acquire, by condemnation or otherwise, any property upon which installments are not due, such installments shall become due as of the date of acquisition of title by the city and shall be set off against any award that may be made for the property acquired, with interest to the date of acquisition of title.\n      � 3.
