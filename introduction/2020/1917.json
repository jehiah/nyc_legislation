  "Summary": "This bill would create an exemption from the prohibition on self-certification established by Local Law 158 for the year 2017 for properties with both residential and non-residential occupancies. Where work was performed without a permit on the part of the building containing the residential occupancy, the occupant of the part of the building containing the non-residential occupancy would still be permitted to self-certify. Similarly, where work was performed without a permit on the part of the building containing the non-residential occupancy, the owner of the building would still be permitted to self-certify.",
