Where work was performed without a permit on the part of the building containing the residential occupancy, the occupant of the part of the building containing the non-residential occupancy would still be permitted to self-certify. Similarly, where work was performed without a permit on the part of the building containing the non-residential occupancy, the owner of the building would still be permitted to self-certify.","TextID":68499,"Text":"Int.
