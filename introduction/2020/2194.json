  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Cultural Affairs (DCLA) to conduct a study of the forces driving the displacement of cultural spaces in the city and means of combatting them and incentivizing the creation of new cultural spaces. The study would include the input of various constituencies—from the arts, real estate and affected communities—as well as an assessment of policy solutions, such as the creation of an independent real estate holding company.",
