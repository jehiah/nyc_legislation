  "Summary": "This bill would allow the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) to identify goods that are in short supply and limit the purchase of such goods when a state of emergency is declared. DCWP would take household size and demand into consideration when it determines the limitations that should be in effect. A penalty would be assessed against retailers who fail to comply with this law.",
