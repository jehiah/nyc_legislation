  "Summary": "Under the City’s Campaign Finance Act and the City Charter, penalties for violations committed by independent spenders (outside organizations or individuals who, without involvement of any candidate, spend money to influence the outcome of an election) are treated differently than penalties for violations committed by candidates. Under the Act, the candidate or “any other agent” of the candidate may be liable for penalties assessed by the Campaign Finance Board. However, the Charter, which sets requirements for independent expenditures, does not explicitly extend liability to agents of independent spenders. This bill amends the Charter to establish liability for violations and penalties to any agent acting on behalf of an independent spender.",
