  "Summary": "This bill would require closed captioning to be enabled on televisions in public areas in places of public accommodation during posted hours of operation, eliminating the need for an individual to request that closed captioning be enabled.  The bill would amend the New York City Human Rights Law to designate failing to so enable closed captioning on televisions in places of public accommodation a discriminatory practice under that law.",
