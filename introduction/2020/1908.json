  "Summary": "This bill would restrict the fees that certain third-party food delivery services, entities that provide restaurants with online order and delivery services, may charge restaurants during states of emergency when restaurants are prohibited from offering food for consumption on-premises, plus an additional 90 days thereafter. During such time periods, third-party delivery services would be prohibited from charging more than a 15% fee per order for providing delivery services to a restaurant, and more than a 5% fee per order for all other types of charges.  Violations of the prohibitions in this bill would be subject to civil penalties of up to $1000 per restaurant per day. The Corporation Counsel would be empowered to enforce the bill’s provisions by instituting civil action against third-party delivery services in violation, and by conducting investigations pursuant to such civil action.",
