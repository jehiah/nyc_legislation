  "Summary": "This bill would require the Commissioner of the Department of Social Services (DSS) to enhance the application of emergency assistance grant programs. It would require the Commissioner to post information on emergency assistance grants including rental or utility arrears grants on the HRA website and to enhance applications for such grants, including creating an informational sheet for prospective benefit applicants in plain language. The informational sheet would include which forms and materials an applicant would be required to submit and whether or not an applicant may be required to pay back any benefits, if received. It would also require the Commissioner to improve the administration of emergency assistance grants in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and to conduct increased outreach on the program. Finally, the bill would require the Commissioner to report quarterly on the administration of emergency assistance grants, including how many applications were newly submitted, how many were accepted and how many were not accepted.",
