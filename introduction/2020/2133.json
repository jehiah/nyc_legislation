  "Summary": "This bill would codify the police department working group on sexual assault cases. The working group would include eight representatives from the police department and eight representatives from community based organizations and advocacy groups. The working group would be tasked with crafting a sexual assault survivor’s bill of rights, and would also develop a list of best practices for the special victims division to put in place for handling cases. The best practices would include recommendations about communication with survivors, information on mental health resources, and a recommendation to distribute the survivor’s bill of rights. The working group would continue to meet every three months to discuss and reform how sexual assault cases are handled.",
