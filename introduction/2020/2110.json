The bill also requires SBS to include in their annual report a detailed description of the education and assistance provided to small businesses with regard to ADA compliance in the preceding fiscal year, the total number of staff who provided such education and assistance, and the total number of people who participated in the training and education provided by SBS related to ADA compliance.",
