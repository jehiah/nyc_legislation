  "Summary": "This bill would require all new police officers to undergo 90 hours of cultural competency training, commencing July 1, 2021. Thirty hours would be required to be completed prior to sitting for the police officer’s exam and would be completed with a cultural competency organization which serves the covered group that filed the most complaints to the Civilian Complaint Review Board (“CCRB”) in the past year. Thirty hours would be required to be completed as part of a police trainee’s academy training and would be completed with a cultural competency organization which serves the covered group that filed the most complaints to the CCRB in the past year. Thirty hours would be required to be completed within one year of an officer being assigned to a precinct and would be completed with a cultural competency organization which serves one of the top three largest covered groups that resides in the officer’s assigned precinct.",
