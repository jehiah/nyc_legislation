  "Summary": "Pursuant to Local Law 152 of 2016 and Department of Buildings (DOB) rules, between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020, building gas piping systems must be inspected in community districts (CD) 1, 3 and 10 in all boroughs. DOB rules also require submission of a certification that all conditions identified in the inspection report have been corrected no later than 120 days or if more time is needed no later than 180 days following the inspection date. This bill would extend the December 31, 2020 inspection deadline for buildings in CD 1, 3 and 10 in all boroughs to June 30, 2021. The bill provides that for such buildings inspected between September 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020, the certification of correction may be submitted later than 120 days or later than 180 days following the inspection date, as applicable, but no later than June 30, 2021. This bill would also require DOB to conduct targeted outreach regarding the requirements of Local Law 152 of 2016, submit a report describing the methods of targeted outreach employed by the agency, and solicit public comments related to the implementation of Local Law 152 of 2016.",
