  "Summary": "In 2010, Congress passed Rosa’s Law, which changed references to “mental retardation” in specified federal laws to “intellectual disability,” in recognition of the fact that the term “mental retardation” is archaic, insensitive and stigmatizing, and clinically outdated. With respect to the City’s consolidated laws, the term “mental retardation” appears in 10 sections across the Charter and the Administrative Code. The proposed bill would remove references to “mental retardation” and substitute the term “intellectual disability” or “intellectual and developmental disability,” as applicable, in such sections.",
  "TextID": 71006,
  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n\n\tSection 1.

The city of New York recognizes that services for people suffering from [mental retardation] intellectual and developmental disabilities are provided by programs administered within a number of different city agencies, as well as by non-governmental entities.

The term \"provider of services\" [shall mean] means an individual, association, corporation or public or private agency which provides for the mentally disabled[; and the].\n       Services for the mentally disabled. The term \"services for the mentally disabled\" [shall mean] means examination, diagnosis, care, treatment, rehabilitation, training, education, research, preventive services, referral, residential services or domiciliary care of or for the mentally disabled, not specifically limited by any other law. \n      b. Notwithstanding the foregoing, planning and programs for persons with substance dependence or chemical dependence shall be conducted by the department, and the department may act as a \"local agency\" to conduct substance abuse programs and seek reimbursement therefore pursuant to provisions of the mental hygiene law relating to funding for substance abuse services, as deemed appropriate by the commissioner in recognition of the programs currently administered by the New York state office of alcoholism and substance abuse services or its successor agency under article [nineteen] 19 of the mental hygiene law.\n      � 3. Subdivision a of section 551 of the New York city charter, as amended by local law number 22 for the year 2002, is amended to read as follows:\n      a. There shall be a department of health and mental hygiene, the head of which shall be the commissioner of health and mental hygiene who shall be appointed by the mayor. The department shall have and exercise all powers of a local health department set forth in law. Notwithstanding any other provision of this charter to the contrary, the department shall be a social services district for purposes of the administration of health-related public assistance programs to the extent agreed upon by the department, the department of social services and the department of homeless services. Appropriations to the department for mental health, [mental retardation] intellectual and developmental disability, and alcoholism services shall be set forth in the expense budget in separate and distinct units of appropriation.
