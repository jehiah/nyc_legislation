  "Summary": "In 2010, Congress passed Rosa‚Äôs Law, which changed references to ‚Äúmental retardation‚Äù in specified federal laws to ‚Äúintellectual disability,‚Äù in recognition of the fact that the term ‚Äúmental retardation‚Äù is archaic, insensitive and stigmatizing, and clinically outdated. With respect to the City‚Äôs consolidated laws, the term ‚Äúmental retardation‚Äù appears in 10 sections across the Charter and the Administrative Code. The proposed bill would remove references to ‚Äúmental retardation‚Äù and substitute the term ‚Äúintellectual disability‚Äù or ‚Äúintellectual and developmental disability,‚Äù as applicable, in such sections.",

The term \"provider of services\" [shall mean] means an individual, association, corporation or public or private agency which provides for the mentally disabled[; and the].\n       Services for the mentally disabled.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, planning and programs for persons with substance dependence or chemical dependence shall be conducted by the department, and the department may act as a \"local agency\" to conduct substance abuse programs and seek reimbursement therefore pursuant to provisions of the mental hygiene law relating to funding for substance abuse services, as deemed appropriate by the commissioner in recognition of the programs currently administered by the New York state office of alcoholism and substance abuse services or its successor agency under article [nineteen] 19 of the mental hygiene law.\n      ÔøΩ 3. Subdivision a of section 551 of the New York city charter, as amended by local law number 22 for the year 2002, is amended to read as follows:\n      a.
