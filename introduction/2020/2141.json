  "Summary": "In 2010, Congress passed Rosa’s Law, which changed references to “mental retardation” in specified federal laws to “intellectual disability,” in recognition of the fact that the term “mental retardation” is archaic, insensitive and stigmatizing, and clinically outdated. With respect to the City’s consolidated laws, the term “mental retardation” appears in 10 sections across the Charter and the Administrative Code. The proposed bill would remove references to “mental retardation” and substitute the term “intellectual disability” or “intellectual and developmental disability,” as applicable, in such sections. The bill would also update references to the New York State Office of Mental Retardation and Development Disabilities, which in 2010 was renamed the New York State Office for People With Developmental Disabilities.",
