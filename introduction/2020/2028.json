  "Summary": "This bill would require veterinarians who provide veterinary services pursuant to a contract with the City of New York to list any adverse events associated with a drug such veterinarian prescribes to a companion animal on the container of such drug. If the container of a drug does not have adequate space to include information on adverse events, a veterinarian may provide such information on a separate document accompanying the drug.",
