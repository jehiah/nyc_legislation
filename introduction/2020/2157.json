  "Summary": "This bill would require the City to create an Open Retail Program that would allow retail establishments to offer outdoor retail to consumers on sidewalks, streets, and other approved open spaces. The Department of Transportation (DOT) would be required to create a self-certification process that indoor retail owners must complete before offering outdoor retail under the program. Such process would not require DOT approval, however, a self-certification could be suspended or terminated by DOT for non-compliance with requirements of the program or for the protection of public health or safety. The program would run until at least December 31, 2020, with the possibility of extension up to December 31, 2021.",
