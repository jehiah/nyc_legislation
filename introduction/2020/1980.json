  "Summary": "This bill would require the Commissioner of Investigation to appoint a special inspector to monitor the emergency procurement contracts entered into by the city in response to COVID-19. The special inspector would report about each contract, review contracts to identify monitoring and integrity deficiencies, and make recommendations for remedying the deficiencies, all in real-time. The database would include, for each contract: (1) the contract requirements; (2) the contract’s dollar value; (3) the vendor’s type of business; (4) the vendor’s inventory of contracted goods; (5) the timeline for delivery; (6) whether the vendor previously did business with the city; (7) whether the vendor previously provided the goods or services required by the contract; and (8) assessments of whether the contractor provided the contracted goods or services to the city.",

The commissioner of investigation shall appoint a special inspector who shall monitor emergency procurement contracts that, in the judgment of such special inspector, are or were entered into by any agency or contracted entity in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The special inspector shall collect and review the details of such procurement contracts with the cooperation of the agency or agencies, or contracted entity, executing such contracts, and the mayor's office of contract services. For the purposes of this local law, the term \"agency\" has the same meaning as such term is defined in section 1150 of the New York city charter, and the term \"contracted entity\" has the same meaning as such term is defined in section 22-821 of the administrative code.\n      b. Within 30 days of the effective date of the local law that added this section, and continuing in real-time thereafter until this local law expires, the special inspector shall report in a publicly available online database about the city emergency procurement contracts the special inspector has reviewed pursuant to subdivision a of this section. The special inspector shall continually evaluate such contracts to identify potential or actual deficiencies in monitoring and integrity, and shall notify the affected agency, agencies or contracted entity, and the mayor's office of contract services, of any such deficiencies along with recommendations for remedying them going forward, in addition to publishing such deficiencies and recommendations in the online database. \n      c. Such online database shall also include, but not be limited to, the following information:\n      1. The requirements of the contract;\n      2. The dollar value of the contract;\n      3. The type of business in which the vendor engages;\n      4. The vendor's inventory of any goods included in the contract;\n      5. The timeline for delivery of the agreed upon goods or services to the city;\n      6. Whether the vendor has a record of previously doing business with the city;\n      7. Whether the vendor has a record of providing the goods or services required by the contract; \n      8. Whether the contractor has provided the agreed upon goods or services to date to the city; and\n      9. Any other information that the mayor or commissioner of investigation may require.\n      � 2.
