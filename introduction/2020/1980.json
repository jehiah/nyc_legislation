  "Summary": "This bill would require the Commissioner of Investigation to appoint a special inspector to monitor the emergency procurement contracts entered into by the city in response to COVID-19. The special inspector would report about each contract, review contracts to identify monitoring and integrity deficiencies, and make recommendations for remedying the deficiencies, all in real-time. The database would include, for each contract: (1) the contract requirements; (2) the contract’s dollar value; (3) the vendor’s type of business; (4) the vendor’s inventory of contracted goods; (5) the timeline for delivery; (6) whether the vendor previously did business with the city; (7) whether the vendor previously provided the goods or services required by the contract; and (8) assessments of whether the contractor provided the contracted goods or services to the city.",

The special inspector shall continually evaluate such contracts to identify potential or actual deficiencies in monitoring and integrity, and shall notify the affected agency, agencies or contracted entity, and the mayor's office of contract services, of any such deficiencies along with recommendations for remedying them going forward, in addition to publishing such deficiencies and recommendations in the online database. \n      c.
