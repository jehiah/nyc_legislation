  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Youth and Community Development (DYCD) to develop and disseminate informational guidance to youth and their parents, or legal guardians, regarding youth online activities. The guidance would include an overview of federal, state and local privacy laws pertaining to youth information collected online and legal protections and best practices on how to maintain the privacy or usage of such information by third parties. The bill would also require an advisory that youth online activity could last in perpetuity, be misconstrued by others, or be subjected to surveillance by law enforcement. DYCD would publish this guidance on its website and distribute it in a hard copy format through its programs.",
