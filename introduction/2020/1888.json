  "Summary": "This bill would prohibit all non-City owned or non-authorized motor vehicles from being used on City elevated boardwalks.

Unauthorized persons who operate a motor vehicle on an elevated boardwalk would be subject to a misdemeanor punishable by up to 90 days imprisonment or a $1,000 fine or both, and a civil penalty between $500 and $1,000.",
