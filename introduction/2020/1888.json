  "Summary": "This bill would prohibit all non-City owned or non-authorized motor vehicles from being used on City elevated boardwalks. It would also require that authorized city employees or contractors only use small utility vehicles under 2,400 pounds for activities on wooden boardwalk unless larger vehicles are necessary for construction, maintenance or public safety needs. Unauthorized persons who operate a motor vehicle on an elevated boardwalk would be subject to a misdemeanor punishable by up to 90 days imprisonment or a $1,000 fine or both, and a civil penalty between $500 and $1,000.",
