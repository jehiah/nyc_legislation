  "Summary": "This bill requires the City to create an open restaurants program that would allow restaurants to offer outdoor dining to patrons on sidewalks and other approved open space. The Department of Transportation (DOT) is required to create a self-certification process that restaurants owners must complete before offering outdoor dining. Such process would not require DOT approval, however, a self-certification could be suspended or terminated by the Department for non-compliance with requirements of the program or for the protection of health or safety. In addition, the City would be required to identify additional areas where food vendors could temporarily operate. The program will run until at least September 8, 2020, with the possibility of extension, but it shall expire by December 31, 2020.",
