  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Education (DOE) to report on a series of metrics whenever it is engaged in remote learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Those metrics would include language access and support provided for English language learners; steps DOE took to ensure incarcerated students received remote instruction; and details on internet enabled devices ordered by the DOE and distributed to students. The term “remote learning” means a system, implemented in lieu of in-person instruction during and as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, that allows teachers to deliver their lessons online, and students to complete assignments, projects, and assessments remotely just as they would in the physical classroom. Remote learning can occur synchronously with real-time teacher-to-student interaction and collaboration, or asynchronously, with self-paced learning activities that take place independently of the teacher.",
