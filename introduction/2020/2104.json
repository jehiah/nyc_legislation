  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Education (DOE) to report on a series of metrics whenever it is engaged in remote learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Those metrics would include language access and support provided for English language learners; steps DOE took to ensure incarcerated students received remote instruction; and details on internet enabled devices ordered by the DOE and distributed to students. The term “remote learning” means a system, implemented in lieu of in-person instruction during and as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, that allows teachers to deliver their lessons online, and students to complete assignments, projects, and assessments remotely just as they would in the physical classroom.
