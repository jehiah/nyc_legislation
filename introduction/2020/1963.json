The program would be required to contain trainings and individualized mentoring sessions that instruct on: drafting a business plan, conducting market research, identifying sources of capital, registering a business, applying for licenses and permits, and hiring and managing employees. SBS would be required to report to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council each year on the number of individuals served through the program and the number who have started their own businesses.",
