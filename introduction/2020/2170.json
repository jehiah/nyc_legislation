  "Summary": "This bill would amend the previously enacted sustainable energy loan program to permit the energy efficiency improvements to be incorporated into real property as an improvement or component of a new or existing building.  It also defines real property to mean any property, an interest in which is or is eligible to be recorded with the city register or the office of the Richmond county clerk by the possessor of such interest.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1.  The definitions of \"energy audit\" and \"energy efficiency improvement\" in section 11-3001 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 96 for the year 2019, are amended to read as follows:\n      Energy audit. The term \"energy audit\" means a formal evaluation of the energy consumption of a permanent building or structural improvement to real property, conducted by a contractor certified by the authority, or certified by a certifying entity approved by the authority for purposes of article 5-L of the general municipal law, or certified by the administering agency, for the purpose of identifying appropriate energy efficiency improvements that could be made to or incorporated into the construction of the property.\n      Energy efficiency improvement. The term \"energy efficiency improvement\" means any improvement to real property, whether as a component of the new construction of a building or as the renovation or retrofitting of [a] an existing building to reduce energy consumption, such as window and door replacement, lighting, caulking, weatherstripping, air sealing, insulation, and heating and cooling system upgrades, and similar improvements, determined to be cost-effective pursuant to criteria established by the authority. However, \"energy efficiency improvement\" shall not include lighting measures or household appliances that are not permanently fixed to real property.\n      � 2. Section 11-3001 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new definition of \"real property\" in alphabetical order to read as follows:\n      Real property.
