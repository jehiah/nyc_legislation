  "Summary": "For each order placed on a food delivery platform, the bill prohibits a food delivery application from soliciting a tip from a customer unless it discloses the amount or proportion of each gratuity provided to the delivery worker; and the manner in which gratuities are provided, whether immediately or not, and whether in cash or not. This information must be provided before or at the same time the gratuity is solicited.  The bill would require applications to credit gratuities to the worker. It would mandate that applications notify workers if a gratuity was added, the amount, whether the customer removed it and why, if a reason was provided, or if a change was made. Each day the applications would be required to inform the worker the total compensation and gratuities earned by that worker the day before. Applications would have to keep records demonstrating their compliance with this bill as part of the requirements of their licensure.",
