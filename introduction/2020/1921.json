  "Summary": "The Department of Health and Mental Hygiene inspects food service establishments for compliance with food safety rules at least once a year. These inspections result in the Department issuing a score, which corresponds to a letter grade. Food service establishments are required to post these grades in an area visible to passersby. However, consumers who purchase food or beverages online do not have access to such letter grades. This bill requires food service establishments and third-party food delivery services (such as Seamless or Grubhub) to post sanitary inspection grades on their websites or other online platforms.",
