  "Summary": "This bill would establish a task force to determine whether and where charging stations for bicycles with electric assist can be built for exclusive use by food delivery workers. The task force will review the cost of building and operating the charging stations, including whether some or all of that cost can be borne by third party courier services or third party delivery services; where such charging stations should be located; whether the operation of the charging stations would best be done by third parties; whether charging station use could be limited to the class of food delivery workers; whether food delivery workers can use the charging stations for free or at low cost; and the way in which such charging stations can mitigate fire risk caused by the lithium-ion batteries contained in bicycles with electric assist.",
