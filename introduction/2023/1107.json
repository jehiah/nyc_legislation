  "Summary": "This bill would require city agencies to include a specification for hazard pay in solicitations for certain kinds of emergency procurements. Specifically, this bill covers solicitations for client services—for example, homeless and foster care services—that an agency makes during a state of emergency related to the outbreak of a communicable disease. Hazard pay would amount to time and one-half of a worker’s regular rate of pay and would be available only to those who must report for work in person during such state of emergency.",
