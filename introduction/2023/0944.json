  "Summary": "This bill would amend existing reporting requirements regarding civil actions filed against the police department or individual police officer.  Specifically, provisions will require the Law Department to report on civil actions that have been resolved in the 6-month period preceding each report, regardless of whether the action was filed within the currently existing 5-year lookback period for reporting.  . The bill also mandates a aggregate reporting on the total number of civil actions filed against the police department each calendar year; the number of such action that remain unresolved as of the end of such calendar years; and the number of actions that have been resolved, disaggregated by manner of resolution.",
