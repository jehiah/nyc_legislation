  "Summary": "This bill would require the Mayor’s Office of Contract Services to create a “document vault” to store all procurement-related documents. The purpose of the vault would be to reduce duplicative requests from agencies and streamline internal document retrieval processes. Documents in the vault would be made available upon request to any city agency or the Economic Development Corporation in furtherance of a contract or procurement.",
