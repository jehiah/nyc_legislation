  "Summary": "This bill would require the Mayor’s Office of Contract Services to create a secure electronic “document vault” to store all procurement-related documents. This would include, among other things, vendor certificates, corporate organizational documents, and financial reports. The purpose of the vault would be to reduce duplicative requests from agencies and streamline internal document retrieval processes. Documents in the vault would be accessible to persons authorized by the vendors upon request in furtherance of a contract or procurement.",
