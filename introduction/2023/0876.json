For capital projects required to comply with subdivision d or e, the mayor may establish an alternative energy intensity requirement for new buildings, or additions to or substantial reconstructions of existing buildings classified in a particular occupancy group that may be less stringent than the energy intensity requirements described in subdivision d or e. Such alternative energy intensity requirement may be less stringent than the energy use intensity described by subdivision d or e to the minimum extent necessary to avoid impracticality or undue burden found by the mayor for a particular occupancy group.\\par\ng. Capital projects, other than those required to comply with green building and energy use standards in accordance with subdivision b, that involve the installation or replacement of HVAC systems at an estimated construction cost for such installation or replacement of $2,000,000 or more, shall be designed and constructed to reduce energy use by a minimum of 10 percent from the standard as determined by the New York city energy conservation code, or other methodology designated by the mayor.\\par\nh. In addition to complying with any other applicable subdivisions in this section, each capital project involving the installation or replacement of plumbing systems that includes the installation or replacement of plumbing fixtures at an estimated construction cost for such installation or replacement of $500,000 or more shall be designed and constructed to reduce potable water consumption in the aggregate by a minimum of 30 percent from the calculated baseline as determined by a methodology not less stringent than that prescribed in LEED water efficiency: indoor water use reduction credit. \\par\ni. This section shall not apply to capital projects that only involve buildings classified in occupancy groups A-5 or U. \\par\nj. The mayor may exempt from each provision of this section a capital project accounting for up to 20 percent of the capital dollars in each fiscal year subject to such provision if, in the mayor\\rquote s sole judgment, exemption from such provision is necessary for the public interest. At the conclusion of each year, the mayor shall inform the city council of any exemption granted pursuant to this subdivision. \\par\nk. This section shall not apply to capital projects of entities that are not city agencies unless 50 percent or more of the estimated cost of such project is to be paid for out of the city treasury. This exemption shall not apply to any capital project that receives $10,000,000 or more out of the city treasury. \\par\nl. The costs listed in subdivisions b, c, d and g are denominated in January 2022 dollars and shall be indexed to inflation annually. \\par\nm. Capital projects that are subject to subdivision b that utilize a version of the LEED green building rating system for which the United States green building council will accept applications for certification, shall apply to the United States green building council for certification that such projects have achieved a gold or higher rating under the LEED green building rating system, or where applicable, a certified or higher rating. The mayor shall establish an alternative certification process for capital projects that are complying with alternative standards promulgated by the mayor pursuant to subdivision c.\\par\nn. No later than December 1 of each year, the mayor shall submit to the speaker of the council a report, containing, at a minimum: \\par\n(1) For each capital project subject to this section completed during the preceding fiscal year: \\par\n(a) A brief description of such project, including the total cost of the project; \\par\n(b) The street address of such project and the community district and council district in which such project is located; \\par\n(c) The estimated level of LEED certification such project has achieved as determined by the city agency that designed such project in accordance with the LEED green building rating system or, if applicable, the level achieved, as certified by the United States green building council; \\par\n(d) A statement as to whether such project has been designed and constructed to comply with the energy use reduction required in subdivision e, as an onsite energy generating building or a net zero energy building and, for each project designed and constructed to comply with the prescribed energy use reduction, the energy use intensity for such building or, if the mayor has adopted an alternative energy intensity target pursuant to subdivision f, such alternative target; \\par\n(e) If such capital project was not designed and constructed as an onsite energy generating building, a description of the reasons therefor, a statement as to whether such building has been designed and constructed to produce any energy onsite from renewable energy sources and, if so, the amount of such onsite energy production expressed as a percentage of the building's total energy needs; and \\par\n(f) An assessment of the environmental and energy-related benefits achieved in comparison with a base-case code compliant project, including projected energy savings reductions in peak load, reductions in emissions and potable water use.\\par\n(2) The total value of capital allocations in the preceding calendar year to projects exempted from the requirements of this section by the mayor pursuant to subdivision j, and a list and brief description of each such project, including but not limited to square footage, project cost and the reason for such exemption, disaggregated by city agency.\\par\no. The mayor shall publish online and submit a report to the speaker of the council within 12 months of establishing any alternative standards pursuant to subdivisions c or f, and every three years thereafter. Such report shall:\\par\n(1) Describe the alternative standard and the occupancy groups to which it will apply; \\par\n(2) Identify any provision in such alterative standard that is less stringent than the standard which it replaces, and for each such provision, describe the reasons why compliance with the standard which it replaces would be impracticable or unduly burdensome for buildings classified in such occupancy groups; \\par\n(3) For an alternative standard provided pursuant to subdivision c that is not for a building classified in occupancy group R, describe how such alternative standard is not less stringent than the standard prescribed for buildings designed to achieve a LEED certified rating under LEED green building rating system version 4; and \\par\n(4) Describe the reasons why the mayor has determined that such alternative standard continues to be necessary and why such standard cannot be made more stringent.\\par\n\\ulnone\\'a7 2. Paragraph 2 of subdivision d of section 3-125 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 6 for the year 2016, is amended to read as follows: \\par\n2. If the geothermal system has the [lowest] \\ul highest\\ulnone  net present value of all alternatives considered it shall be selected for implementation.  \\par\n\\'a7 3. This local law takes effect immediately, except that for a capital project that has either (A) received the last certificate to proceed for construction, or the last certificate for design and construction prior to bid, as issued by the New York city office of management and budget, prior to the effective date of this local law, or (B) has submitted documentation to obtain a permit from the New York city department of buildings prior to the effective date of this local law, the repeal and reenactment of section 224.1 of the New York city charter pursuant to section one of this local law shall not apply, and section 224.1 of the New York city charter as was in effect prior to the repeal and re-enactment of such section pursuant to this local law, and any rules promulgated thereto, shall continue to be in effect as if such section had not been so repealed and re-enacted.\\par\n\\pard\\ltrpar\\noline\\hyphpar0\\sl480\\slmult1\\qj\\par\n\\pard\\ltrpar\\noline\\hyphpar0\\qj\\fs18 AS\\par\n2/15/2023 6:38 p.m.\\par\n}\n",
