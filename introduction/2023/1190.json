  "Summary": "Under existing local law, in order to become a firefighter for the New York City Fire Department (FDNY) an individual may not have passed their twenty-ninth birthday on the date of the filing of their application for civil service examination.  This legislation would create a one-time waiver from this requirement for certain employees of the FDNY Bureau of Emergency Medical Services (FDNY EMS). Such waiver would apply to the next promotion examination for EMS workers to become firefighters.",
