  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation to promulgate rules to ensure that Open Streets, which are streets or designated areas of streets that prioritize use by pedestrians and cyclists, are not only managed but also designed in such a way that allows emergency vehicles, including firefighting vehicles, to enter into, exit from, and pass through them at all times. These regulations would require this level of access without involving the manual rearrangement of barriers or signs. The bill would also require that the Department of Transportation promulgate rules relating to procedures to notify pedestrians and cyclists that vehicles may pass through the Open Street.",
