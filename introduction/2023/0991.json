  "Summary": "This bill would create cure periods for certain violations issued by the Fire Department of the City of New York, the Department of Sanitation, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Environmental Protection, and the Department of Buildings for veterans service organizations. Cure periods would be 120 days in length, with a possibility of extension. A veterans service organization that cures a violation within the cure period would avoid being required to pay a fine or civil penalty. No cure period would be authorized, however, for a violation that is an immediate threat to health or safety. This bill would also require the Department of Veterans’ Services to conduct a public information and outreach campaign regarding the new cure periods.",
