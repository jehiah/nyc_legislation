  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Buildings (“DOB”) to conduct a loadbearing capacity study for parking garages. DOB would be required to assess factors such as the size, age, materials, and structural design of the parking structure. After conducting this study, DOB is also required to report any recommendations based on their findings. No later than 180 days after the effective date of this local law, DOB shall submit to the mayor, the speaker of the council, and post on its website a report on the findings of this study.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. a. Definitions. For the purposes of this local law, the following terms have the following meanings:\n      Department. The term \"department\" means the department of buildings.\n      Parking garage. The term \"parking garage\" means a structure or portion of a structure, other than a private garage or carport, used for the parking or storage of motor vehicles.\n      b. Loadbearing capacity study. The department, in collaboration with any other office or agency, shall study and report on the structural loadbearing capacity of parking garages, for the purpose of evaluating the efficacy of existing loadbearing capacity limits. No later than 180 days after the effective date of this local law, the department shall submit to the mayor and the speaker of the council, and shall post conspicuously on the department's website, a report on the findings of this study, including any recommendations based on such findings. Such study and report shall include an assessment of the impact of the following factors on a parking garage's loadbearing capacity:\n1. The age of the material components of the parking garage;\n2. The effect of exposure to environmental conditions, such as extreme temperature, fire, frost, and moisture;\n3. A parking garage's history of maintenance and repairs;\n4. The condition of the materials in the parking garage, for example, loose concrete in danger of falling, ceiling slab cracks, missing concrete covering steel beams, and defective concrete;\n5. How often the parking garage is at or exceeds capacity;\n6. The size of the parking garage, including the thickness and the height of the walls and supporting structures;\n7. The density of the material of the parking garage as it relates to its compressive strength, resistance to forces, bending, and vibration; \n8. The structural design of the parking garage, for example, the shape of the structure or if the garage is braced;\n9. The impact of increasing weights of individual vehicles, particularly electric vehicles, as well as charging stations and equipment; and\n10. Any other information relevant to assessing the loadbearing capacity and safety of parking garages.\n      � 2.
