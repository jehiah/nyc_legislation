Owners of towed vehicles and equipment could be charged for the cost of towing and for the storage of vehicles and equipment, and may be subject to forfeiture proceedings.",

The department of sanitation shall establish by rule the time within which vehicle or equipment that are not redeemed may be deemed abandoned and the procedures for disposal.\n      g. 1. In addition to any other penalty or sanction provided for in this section, any  vehicle or equipment seized pursuant to subdivision d of this section, and all rights, title, and interest therein shall be subject to forfeiture to the city upon notice and judicial determination thereof if the owner of such vehicle or equipment has been found liable at least 2 times within a 3 year period for having violated subdivision 4 or 6 of section 16-118 or paragraph 1 of subdivision b of section 15-205.  \n      2.
