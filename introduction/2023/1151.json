Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following terms have the following meanings:\n      Crosswalk. The term \"crosswalk\" means that part of a roadway, whether marked or unmarked, which is included within the extension of the sidewalk lines between opposite sides of the roadway at an intersection. \n      Traffic control device. The term \"traffic control device\" means a sign, signal, marking or device not inconsistent with the vehicle and traffic law that is placed or erected by authority of a public body or official having jurisdiction for the purpose of regulating, warning or guiding traffic.\n      b.

The department shall conduct a study regarding the efficacy of using illuminated, solar-powered traffic control devices at crosswalks. Such study shall examine, at minimum, the utility of solar-powered traffic control devices, including a comparison of their effectiveness in deterring violations of vehicle and traffic laws, rules and regulations with the effectiveness of traffic control signs at crosswalks that are not illuminated in deterring the same, identify any logistical challenges in siting such devices, and make recommendations regarding their expanded use. The department shall post on its website and submit to the speaker of the council a report of such study that contains its findings and recommendations no later than 2 years after the effective date of the local law that added this section. \n      � 2.
