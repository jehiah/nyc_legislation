Regardless, all the program completion dates and report due dates required under such provisions have long since passed.   Unconstitutional provisions ‚Äì 3 provisions - These provisions of the Administrative Code have been deemed unconstitutional. \tOutdated provisions ‚Äì 2 provisions - These two provisions are obsolete due to changed circumstances.",
