  "Summary": "The proposed legislation would repeal from the Administrative Code: Temporary or Pilot Programs:  Such provisions would be repealed as each of the programs have expired. Some provisions require only the creation of a program for a specific period of time, while others also require submission of an accompanying report by a specific date. Regardless, all the program completion dates and report due dates required under such provisions have long since passed; Unconstitutional Provisions: provisions of the Administrative Code that have been deemed unconstitutional; and Outdated Provisions: sections of the Administrative Code that are obsolete due to changed circumstances.",
