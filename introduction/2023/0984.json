  "Summary": "The proposed legislation would repeal 12 provisions from the Administrative Code:\r\nTemporary or pilot programs – 7 provisions - Such provisions would be repealed as each of the programs have expired. Some provisions require only the creation of a program for a specific period of time, while others also require submission of an accompanying report by a specific date. Regardless, all the program completion dates and report due dates required under such provisions have long since passed.   Unconstitutional provisions – 3 provisions - These provisions of the Administrative Code have been deemed unconstitutional. \tOutdated provisions – 2 provisions - These two provisions are obsolete due to changed circumstances.",
