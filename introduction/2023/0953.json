  "Summary": "This bill would limit increases of occupancy fees for self-storage facilities so that the occupancy fee for a self-storage unit occupied continuously by the same occupant could not increase by more than 2 percent per year. In addition, storage facilities would not be permitted to terminate occupancies for any reason other than non-payment of required fees. Violations of the prohibitions in this bill would be subject to civil penalties of up to $2,500 per year per storage unit. The Corporation Counsel would be empowered to enforce the bill’s provisions by instituting a civil action against any self-storage facility in violation, and by conducting an investigation pursuant to such civil action.",
