  "Summary": "This bill would require owners of most parking garages to refuse to park any vehicle on a level of such garage when doing so would cause the collective weight of vehicles on that level to exceed its maximum permissible weight limit. Each such garage would be required to install a motor vehicle weigh station so that an entering vehicle could be weighed before determining if parking such vehicle is feasible. Moreover, commercially licensed parking garages would be required to display information regarding the maximum permissible weight limits on levels within such garages and to notify the public when no further vehicles may be parked without the weight limit on each level being exceeded.",
