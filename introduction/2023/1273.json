  "Summary": "This bill would require the comptroller to establish and maintain an interactive database to be published on a publicly available webpage with information on the expenditure of funds in connection with the state of emergency declared by the mayor in Executive Order 224 concerning the arrival of thousands of individuals and families seeking asylum. The database would provide expenditure data on a quarterly basis, disaggregated by contract type. For each construction project, executed city procurement contract, and local, state, or federal grant or loan issuance associated with the migrant crisis, the data must include the contractors, the type of funding provided, the total number of jobs at the time of award of emergency funds, and the total number of additional jobs to be created and retained over the life of the project.",
