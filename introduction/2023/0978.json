  "Summary": "The proposed bill requires large chain stores to donate, rather than dispose of, nonsalable personal care products. The bill only requires donation if the product is not needed by the store, will not be sold by the store, and would otherwise be disposed of by the store. The proposed bill also requires the department of sanitation, or such other agency as may be designated by the mayor, to set up a web portal to facilitate donations of these products to qualified non-profit organizations.",
