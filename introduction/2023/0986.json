  "Summary": "The proposed legislation would repeal provisions of the Charter and Administrative Code establishing certain advisory boards, task forces or commissions. Such provisions would be repealed for at least one of the following reasons: the body no longer convenes and has been dormant for a substantial period of time; the provision establishing the body calls for the submission of a one-time report and no further activity; the body no longer provides any useful function; the duties assigned to the body are duplicative of the functions of other City bodies; or the provision was waived by the Report and Advisory Board Review Commission.",
