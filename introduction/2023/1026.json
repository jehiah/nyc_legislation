  "Summary": "This bill would require an agency or office designated by the mayor to prepare a report examining options for the potential construction of a bus transit center in or around Flushing, Queens. The report would also estimate the projected costs associated with the construction of such bus transit center, how bus routes may be redesigned to arrive at the transit center, and projected local benefits. The designated agency or office would be required to submit a report to the Council, the Mayor, and the city planning commission with its findings.",
