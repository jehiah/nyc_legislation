  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Citywide Administrative Services to identify civil service positions that do not require fluency in English and offer those exams in the designated citywide languages. It would also require the Department of Citywide Administrative Services to consult with the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs and community-based organizations to determine other languages in which to offer those exams based on the needs of eligible exam takers. Finally, the bill would also allow exam takers to request that such exams be administered in the language of their choice and provide an explanation if the exam is not offered in that language.",
