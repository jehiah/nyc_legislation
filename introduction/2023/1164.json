  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation to promote equity in infrastructure investment as part of its master plan, and include an investment roadmap as part of each master plan beginning with the one due December 1, 2026. The investment roadmap would, in each community district, measure the existing levels of investment in safety-enhancing street infrastructure and other types of street infrastructure, and identify the incidence rate of collisions that result in significant injuries. The roadmap would also describe how the master plan would raise the relative level of investment in community districts with low levels of investment, and in environmental justice areas.",
