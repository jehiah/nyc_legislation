  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Transportation (“DOT”) to promote equity in infrastructure investment as part of its master plan, and include an investment roadmap as part of each plan beginning with the one due December 1, 2026. The investment roadmap would require DOT to identify underserved neighborhoods with a high need of additional infrastructure based on existing infrastructure and safety needs, and to describe future investments in these neighborhoods so they are no longer underserved. DOT would report, for each neighborhood: the level of investment in safety-enhancing street infrastructure, and other types of street infrastructure, made in the past 15 years, the incidence rate of collisions that result in significant injuries, the demographics of the neighborhood, whether the neighborhood is considered underserved, and if the neighborhood has received low investment but is not considered underserved, the factors that DOT considered in reaching that conclusion.",
