Individuals surrendering a gun would not be required to provide identification or any personally identifiable information, and would not be subject to criminal or civil penalties for the illegal possession of such gun, unless such penalties are required by local, state or federal laws, rules or regulations. The gun buy-back program would take place in a different borough at least once each month, on a rotating basis.",
