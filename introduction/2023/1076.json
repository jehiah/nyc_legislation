  "Summary": "This bill would require that the Commissioner of Citywide Administrative Services, in coordination with other City agency heads and after notifying facility employees, permit members of the public to use readily accessible bathrooms in public-facing municipal buildings during business hours. The bill would also require signage to identify each bathroom’s location, hours, and accessibility for persons with disabilities. The bill would further require an implementation report and periodic updates to be sent to the Council, the Mayor, the Public Advocate, and community boards. These bathrooms’ locations would be posted to a city website listing all public bathrooms in the City, and included in a city land use list maintained by the Department of Citywide Administrative Services.",
