  "Summary": "This legislation would require the Department of Correction to record video of every interaction between incarcerated individuals and correction officers in which an incarcerated individual is informed about a scheduled court appearance. Upon request, these video files must be provided to a defense attorney within three business days. In addition, the bill requires the department to establish a means by which real-time information regarding an incarcerated individual’s departure from their housing facility on the date of their scheduled court appearance can be communicated to defense attorneys and, if necessary, make available a telephone number where such information can be obtained. Finally, the bill requires monthly public reporting on outcomes related to court production including, the number of individuals not delivered to their court appearance, arrival times, and how often use-of-force is required to compel court attendance.",
