  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR), in coordination with the Department of Education (DOE), to create a plan that would identify and facilitate the use of indoor basketball courts and gyms for organized basketball leagues to use when weather would not permit use of outdoor basketball courts. The plan would need to address how DPR will facilitate the use of indoor basketball courts and gyms that are maintained or operated by the city, how DPR will coordinate with other relevant agencies to facilitate the use of indoor basketball courts and gyms, and ways to identify private indoor basketball courts and gyms that are available for use by basketball leagues.",
