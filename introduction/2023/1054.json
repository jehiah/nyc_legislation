  "Summary": "This bill would require last-mile distribution centers to be licensed by the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP”), and for licenses to be renewed every year. If a last-mile distribution center failed to comply with any City, State, or Federal laws, including any labor or environmental laws, DCWP could deny a license for the last-mile distribution center. The bill would also provide for the imposition of caps on the number of last-mile distribution centers in each community district.",

Multiple violations of city, state or federal law relating to worker protections, compensation, safety or discrimination or the protection of the environment by an applicant shall be grounds for denial of a license or renewal of a license.\n      4. For any last-mile distribution center located in a significant maritime industrial area as designated by a local waterfront revitalization program, 80 percent of deliveries to and from such distribution center shall be conducted by marine transport unless the applicant can demonstrate to the department the infeasibility of such requirement. \n      c. Fee and license term. There shall be an annual fee of $500 for a license to engage in the business of a last-mile distribution center at each location where a last-mile distribution center operates in the city.

An employer's failure to maintain, retain or produce a record or other information required to be maintained by this chapter and requested by the department in furtherance of an investigation conducted pursuant to this chapter that is relevant to a material fact alleged by the department in a notice of violation issued pursuant to this subchapter creates a rebuttable presumption that such fact is true.\n      � 20-1607 Administrative enforcement; jurisdiction and complaint procedures. a. Jurisdiction. The commissioner shall enforce the provisions of this chapter.\n      b. Complaints and investigations. 1. Any person, including any organization, alleging a violation of this chapter may file a complaint with the department within 2 years of the date such person knew or should have known of the alleged violation.\n      2.

Employers who have established practical necessity for using data from electronic monitoring for tracking and assessing employee performance may not rely solely on such data but must also use other means of assessment such as manager observation or interviewing clients, customers or other employees to solicit feedback.\n      b. Notwithstanding subdivision a, an employer may use data gathered through electronic monitoring:\n      1. To record the beginning or end of a work shift, meal break, or rest break;\n      2.
