  "Summary": "This bill would require last-mile distribution centers to be licensed by the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP”), and for licenses to be renewed every two years. If a last-mile distribution center failed to comply with any City, State, or Federal laws, including any labor or environmental laws, DCWP could deny a license for the last-mile distribution center. The bill would also provide for the imposition of caps on the number of last-mile distribution centers in each community district.",

The term \"last-mile distribution center\":\n      1. Means a building of 10,000 square feet or more that is operated primarily for the purpose of receiving and sorting goods as part of a distribution channel, and from which goods are then directly transported within 72 hours to end customers; and\n      2. Does not include any facility that is open to retail customers.\n      � 20-565.1 Licensing of last-mile distribution centers. a. License required. 1. It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in business as a last-mile distribution center without a valid license, as hereinafter prescribed, for each place of business wherein such person operates a last-mile distribution center. \n      2. It shall be unlawful for a person to permit any premises under such person's control to be used by any other person in violation of paragraph 1 of subdivision a of this section.\n      b. License application. 1. In order to obtain or renew a license to engage in business as a last-mile distribution center, a person shall file an application with the commissioner for a license for each place of business that the applicant desires to use for the operation of a last-mile distribution center in the city. The application for each license or renewal thereof shall be made upon such form as prescribed by the commissioner and shall contain such information as the commissioner shall require.\n      2. An applicant for a license or renewal thereof under this section shall disclose to the commissioner any finding by a court of law or any final agency determination that the applicant violated any city, state, or federal law relating to worker protection or the protection of the environment, and any additional information that the commissioner deems appropriate. \n      c. Fee and license term. There shall be an annual fee of $200 for a license to engage in the business of a last-mile distribution center at each location where a last-mile distribution center operates in the city.

A license shall be issued or renewed to a person to conduct the business of a last-mile distribution center in the city only if:\n      (a) The applicant for a license or renewal thereof meets all the requirements prescribed herein and any criteria in addition thereto established by the commissioner by rule as deemed necessary to effectuate the purposes of this subchapter;\n      (b) The applicant satisfies the commissioner that such applicant is in compliance with all city, state and federal laws, rules and regulations applicable to doing business as a last-mile distribution center, including but not limited to any law relating to worker protection or the protection of the environment; and that such applicant has not materially misrepresented or concealed any information in the license application, as determined by the commissioner; and\n      (c) The issuance or renewal of such license would not cause the number of licenses in the community district in which the place of business of such applicant is located to exceed the community district last-mile distribution center cap.\n      2. A last-mile distribution center license shall not be assignable and shall be valid only for the persons in whose names it is issued and for the transaction of business in the place designated therein and shall at all times be conspicuously displayed at the place for which it is issued.\n      3. An applicant may seek review, in the office of administrative trials and hearings, of a determination by the commissioner to deny an application for a license or a renewal thereof under this section within 30 days of receiving written notification of such determination.\n      e.

A licensee may seek review, in the office of administrative trials and hearings, of a determination by the commissioner that a license has been suspended or revoked within 30 days of receiving written notification of such determination.\n      � 20-565.3 Pattern or practice of violations. a. The commissioner may deny any application for a license or renewal thereof, or revoke or suspend any license, if the applicant or licensee has engaged in a pattern or practice of violations of city, state or federal law relating to worker protection or the protection of the environment in connection with operating one or more last-mile distribution centers in the city. \n      b. For the purpose of this section, the term \"violation,\" as applied to any city, state or federal law, means a finding by a court of law or a final agency determination that the applicant or licensee violated such law.\n      � 20-565.4 Penalties.
