  "Summary": "This bill would require last-mile distribution centers to be licensed by the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP”), and for licenses to be renewed every year. If a last-mile distribution center failed to comply with any City, State, or Federal laws, including any labor or environmental laws, DCWP could deny a license for the last-mile distribution center. The bill would also provide for the imposition of caps on the number of last-mile distribution centers in each community district.",

Points may be earned through the purchase of near-zero and zero emission equipment or equipment that facilitates the use of near-zero and zero emission equipment, and through the use of near-zero and zero emission equipment, or by choosing to pay a mitigation fee to be expended exclusively in connection with environmental hazards in the community district of the operator who generated such funds or using any combination thereof.\n      End customer.

It is unlawful for a person to permit any premises under such person's control to be used by any other person in violation of paragraph 1 of this subdivision.\n      b. License application. 1. In order to obtain or renew a license to engage in business as a last-mile distribution center, a person shall file an application with the commissioner for a last-mile distribution center license for each place of business that the applicant desires to use for the operation of a last-mile distribution center in the city. The application for each such license or renewal thereof shall be made upon such form as prescribed by the commissioner and shall include an environmental health and safety plan as required pursuant to section 20-565.2 and such additional information as the commissioner shall require.\n      2.

Multiple violations of city, state or federal law relating to worker protections, compensation, safety or discrimination or the protection of the environment by an applicant shall be grounds for denial of a license or renewal of a license.\n      4. For any last-mile distribution center located in a significant maritime industrial area as designated by a local waterfront revitalization program, 80 percent of deliveries to and from such distribution center shall be conducted by marine transport unless the applicant can demonstrate to the department the infeasibility of such requirement. \n      c. Fee and license term. There shall be an annual fee of $500 for a license to engage in the business of a last-mile distribution center at each location where a last-mile distribution center operates in the city.

Such rules shall also designate point values associated with particular purchases or uses based on cost accrued by the last-mile distribution center, reduction in nitrogen oxides and reduction in diesel particulate matter; and\n      (f) Less than 50 percent of the goods processed at such center was ordered through a website or application with 1 brand or trade name or a common brand, trade, business or operating name, that offers, facilitates or otherwise offers consumers goods for direct delivery that will be fulfilled through a last-mile distribution center. \n      2. A last-mile distribution center license shall not be assignable and shall be valid only for the person in whose name it is issued and for the transaction of business in the place designated therein and shall at all times be conspicuously displayed at the place for which it is issued. \n      3.

Such evaluation shall include consideration of the number of last-mile distribution centers in the community district. If, based on the evaluation, the commissioner determines that a change to any community district last-mile distribution center cap is warranted in order to protect and promote the health, safety and wellbeing of city residents, the commissioner may amend such cap by rule. \n      3. The commissioner shall promulgate rules governing the application process for new last-mile distribution center licenses after the establishment of a community district last-mile distribution center cap. \n      f. Undue license concentration. 1. No single person shall hold more than 5 licenses or share in the ownership of a person or entity who holds more than 5 licenses.  \n      2.

An employer's failure to maintain, retain or produce a record or other information required to be maintained by this chapter and requested by the department in furtherance of an investigation conducted pursuant to this chapter that is relevant to a material fact alleged by the department in a notice of violation issued pursuant to this subchapter creates a rebuttable presumption that such fact is true.\n      � 20-1607 Administrative enforcement; jurisdiction and complaint procedures. a.

No person shall file a complaint with the department after filing a civil action unless such action has been withdrawn or dismissed without prejudice to further action.\n      4.

Any person, including any organization, may bring a suit against an employer for failure to abide by any commitment, statement of values or promise found in an employee handbook, manual or corporate code of conduct, made in marketing, advertisements or on packaging, or regulatory filings.

Nothing in this section prohibits (i) the department from exercising its authority under section 20-1607 through 20-1609, or (ii) a person alleging a violation of this chapter from filing a complaint pursuant to section 20-1607 or a civil action pursuant to section 20-1611 provided that a civil action pursuant to this section shall not have previously been commenced.\n      b.

Except as otherwise provided by law, before deploying any covered technology at a workplace or job site, any employer shall submit an application for approval to the department. Such submission shall be accompanied by a description of the purposes for the technology, any outputs or data collected, the uses of the data collected, how long the employer retains the outputs or data, any adverse mental or physical health effects the technology has on workers, whether the employer shares the outputs or data with any third parties and, if so, the identities of such third parties, the procedures the employer will implement to allow an employee to challenge any personal data collected and an impact assessment of any algorithms. The employer shall also submit evidence of notice to any certified representative of their employees and either a copy of their written assent and on what terms or for what consideration it was granted or a description of why such assent is not required.

Employers cannot establish the practical necessity for electronic monitoring without previously filing with the department an impartial evaluation from an independent auditor that said electronic monitoring is effective in undertaking its designated task.\n      3. Employers who have established practical necessity for using data from electronic monitoring for tracking and assessing employee performance may not rely solely on such data but must also use other means of assessment such as manager observation or interviewing clients, customers or other employees to solicit feedback.\n      b. Notwithstanding subdivision a, an employer may use data gathered through electronic monitoring:\n      1. To record the beginning or end of a work shift, meal break, or rest break;\n      2. For non-employment-related purposes;\n      3. To discharge or discipline an employee in cases of egregious misconduct or involving threats to the health or safety of other persons; or\n      4.

Such reviews can occur not more than once a quarter and can occur for a duration of time not longer than 3 hours.\n      f.

Whether the data gathered through electronic monitoring will be used to make or inform disciplinary or discharge decisions, and if so, the nature of that decision, including any associated benchmarks or performance standards;\n      2.

An employer who engages in periodic electronic monitoring of employees for the purposes of discipline or discharge shall inform the affected employees of the specific events which are being monitored at the time the monitoring takes place.\n      3. Notice of periodic electronic monitoring may be given after electronic monitoring has occurred only if necessary to preserve the integrity of an investigation of illegal activity or protect the immediate safety of employees, customers or the public.\n      5. An employer shall provide additional notice to employees when an update or change is made to the electronic monitoring or in how the employer is using it.\n      h.
