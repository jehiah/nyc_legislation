  "Summary": "This bill would require the New York City Commission on Human Rights (CCHR) to coordinate with the Office for the Prevention of Hate Crimes, the Office of Ethnic and Community Media, other relevant agencies, and community groups to conduct annual public education campaigns to combat antisemitism, raise awareness of the contributions of Jewish New Yorkers to the City, and promote inclusion, equity, and understanding. Campaigns would occur every year during Jewish American Heritage Month, or other appropriate month selected by CCHR, and would use diverse forms of media and emphasize youth education. The bill would also require that the first education campaign last for a full year, beginning within 60 days of the bill’s effective date.",
