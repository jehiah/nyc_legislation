  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, in consultation with New York City Health and Hospitals, to create guidance to educate medical professionals and the public on the detection of the sickle cell trait through pre- and post-conception genetic screening and on the management and treatment of sickle cell disease. Guidance for medical professionals is required to include education on the benefits of recommending screenings during the family planning process and on nondiscriminatory approaches to assess patient pain, including instruction on implicit bias in the provision of pain management. The bill would also require that pre- and post- conception genetic screening for sickle cell trait be offered to those who fall into an at-risk population or for whom such screening is otherwise medically recommended.",
