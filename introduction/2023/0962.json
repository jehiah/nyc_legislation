  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR) to conduct a survey of sites owned by the City to identify suitable locations where additional public swimming pools could be built, with a focus on Environmental Justice (EJ) Communities and determine whether sites can accommodate more than one pool or other athletic equipment. It would also require that DPR consult with the Department of Education (DOE) on creating a plan to open pools under DOE jurisdiction for use by the public.  Finally, it would require that DPR offer free swimming lessons at swimming pools under its jurisdiction.",

The department of parks and recreation shall conduct a survey of sites, owned by the city of New York in each borough, to determine which of those sites are suitable for the construction of public swimming pools, provided that surveyed sites located in environmental justice areas, as such term is defined in section 3-1001 of the administrative code of the city of New York, are prioritized for analysis. Such survey shall be submitted to the mayor and the speaker of the council by no later than July 1, 2024 and include, but not be limited to, the following information:\n      1.

For each site where it is determined that a public swimming pool can be constructed on such site, a description of the necessary steps associated with constructing such swimming pool, a determination on whether such site can accommodate more than one swimming pool or additional recreational or athletic facilities, an estimated length of time that would be needed to construct such swimming pool or facilities, and an estimate of the overall cost to do so. \n      � 2.  The department of parks and recreation, in consultation with the department of education, shall develop a plan to provide public access to suitable swimming pool facilities located in department of education buildings. Such plan shall be submitted to the mayor and the speaker of the council by no later than July 1, 2024.\n      � 3.
