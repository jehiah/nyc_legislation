  "Summary": "This bill would require DPR, with other City agencies, to conduct a survey of sites owned by the City to identify suitable locations where additional public swimming pools could be built, with a focus on communities that do not have access to pools, determine whether sites can accommodate more than one pool or other athletic equipment, assess the ongoing capital needs of its pools and update the assessment routinely. It would also require that DPR consult with the Department of Education (DOE) on creating a plan to open pools under DOE jurisdiction for use by the public.  Finally, it would require that DPR offer free swimming lessons at indoor swimming pools under its jurisdiction.",

Title 18 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding new sections 18-161 and 18-162 to read as follows:\n      � 18-161 Swimming pool assessment and location survey. a. An agency or office designated by the mayor, in consultation with the department of parks and recreation and any city agency, state agency, public authority, or person whom the agency or office deems to have appropriate information or expertise, shall conduct a survey of property owned and controlled by the city of New York in each borough to analyze whether any such property may be suitable for the construction of a swimming pool, provided that, to the extent practicable, any such property located in an environmental justice area, as such term is defined in section 3-1001, shall be prioritized for such analysis. The designated agency or office shall submit such survey to the mayor and the speaker of the council no later than October 1, 2025. Such survey shall include, but not be limited to:\n      1. The location of each surveyed property and a description of the city agency or office that has jurisdiction over such property;\n      2. An analysis of the condition of each surveyed property and a determination whether construction of a swimming pool on such property is feasible;  \n      3. For each property where such analysis indicates that construction of a swimming pool is feasible, a description of the necessary steps that would be associated with such construction, an assessment of whether construction of more than 1 swimming pool or an additional recreational or athletic facility on such property is feasible, a description of the typical length of time of a construction project for such swimming pool or such a facility, a description of the typical overall cost of such a project, and an indication whether such property is located within an environmental justice area, as such term is defined in section 3-1001; and\n      4. A list of proposed properties where the construction of a pool is planned within 5 fiscal years following submission of the survey required by this section, including a description of factors that may be considered by the department in identifying the properties in such list, including whether such properties are located in a low- or moderate-income community.\n      b. No later than October 1, 2025, the designated agency or office shall also submit an assessment of existing swimming pools located on property owned and controlled by the city of New York to the mayor and the speaker of the council. Such assessment shall include, but need not be limited to, the following information:\n      1. For each such swimming pool undergoing capital reconstruction or planned to undergo capital reconstruction, an assessment that describes the capital or maintenance needs that prompted the capital work, the current estimated costs for such work, and whether the property is located in an environmental justice area, as such term is defined in section 3-1001; and\n      2. For each such swimming pool, a description of the educational and recreational programs offered and how such programs meet the needs of the community district where such pool is located.\n      c. The designated agency or office shall update the assessment described in subdivision b of this section and submit such update to the mayor and speaker of the council no later than October 1, 2027 and every 2 years thereafter. Such update shall also include a description of any new locations, if any, that were surveyed for potential pool construction since the initial survey pursuant to subdivision a of this section occurred, or whether any changes to the condition of previously surveyed sites has occurred.\n      � 18-162 Swimming lessons at indoor pools. Subject to appropriation and the availability of adequate facilities and sufficient staffing to meet the requirements of this section, the department shall offer swimming lessons for children and adults, including persons with disabilities, at each indoor pool location under the jurisdiction of the commissioner that is open to the public.
