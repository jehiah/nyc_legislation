  "Summary": "This bill would require DPR, with other City agencies, to conduct a survey of sites owned by the City to identify suitable locations where additional public swimming pools could be built, with a focus on communities that do not have access to pools, determine whether sites can accommodate more than one pool or other athletic equipment, assess the ongoing capital needs of its pools and update the assessment routinely. It would also require that DPR consult with the Department of Education (DOE) on creating a plan to open pools under DOE jurisdiction for use by the public.  Finally, it would require that DPR offer free swimming lessons at indoor swimming pools under its jurisdiction.",
