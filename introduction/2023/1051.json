  "Summary": "This bill would expand Senior Citizen Rent Increase Exemption (SCRIE) and Disability Rent Increase Exemption (DRIE) program eligibility. It would authorize rent increase exemptions/tax abatements for tenants of former Mitchell-Lama apartments that meet certain conditions and authorize exemptions to payment in lieu of taxes (PILOT) for tenants of certain Battery Park City apartments through the amendment of certain provisions of chapter 7 of title 26 of the Administrative Code. It would make the effective date of the rent increase exemption order/tax abatement May 31, 2022 for tenants of former Mitchell-Lama apartments who are found eligible during a determination period, as prescribed by state law.",
