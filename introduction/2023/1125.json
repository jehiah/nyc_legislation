  "Summary": "This bill would permit pedestrians to legally cross a roadway at any point, including outside of a marked or unmarked crosswalk, and allow for crossing against traffic signals. It would legalize the activity commonly referred to as “jaywalking” and specify that no penalties can be imposed for jaywalking.",

Section 19-195 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as added by local law number 115 for the year 2016, is amended to read as follows: \n      � 19-195 Pedestrian crossings and control signals. a. Whenever pedestrian control signals are in operation, exhibiting symbols of a walking person, upraised hand, or upraised hand with a pedestrian countdown display, or any other internationally recognized representation concerning the movement of pedestrians, such signals shall indicate as follows:\n      1. Steady walking person. Pedestrians facing such signal may proceed across the roadway in the direction of such signal, and other traffic shall yield the right of way to such pedestrians. \n      2. Flashing upraised hand or flashing upraised hand with pedestrian countdown display. Pedestrians facing such signal are advised that there may be insufficient time to cross the roadway. Pedestrians already in the roadway [shall] are advised to proceed to the nearest sidewalk or safety island in the direction of such signal. Other traffic shall yield the right of way to pedestrians proceeding across the roadway within the crosswalk towards such signal for as long as such signal remains flashing.\n      3. Steady upraised hand. [No pedestrians shall start to cross the roadway in the direction of such signal] Pedestrians facing such a signal are advised that vehicle traffic has the right of way and pedestrians entering the roadway while this signal is displayed will be at risk of injury due to vehicle traffic; provided, however that any pedestrians who have partially completed their crossing on a steady walking person signal or any flashing upraised hand signal [shall] are advised to proceed to the nearest sidewalk or safety island in the direction of such signal while such steady upraised hand signal is showing. \n      b. Pedestrians may cross any roadway at any point, including points outside of a marked or unmarked crosswalk. Pedestrians are advised to yield the right of way to all vehicles upon the roadway. \n      c.
