  "Summary": "This bill would require the Campaign Finance Board to develop and regularly update guidance on the procedures under the New York State Election Law for making a voter record confidential and for voting by special ballot. In addition, the bill would require the Office to End Domestic and Gender–Based Violence (ENDGBV) to distribute such guidance to individuals receiving services at Family Justice Centers, and to provide such individuals with assistance in preparing and submitting written statements to the Board of Elections for the purpose of making their voter records confidential or establishing their eligibility to vote by special ballot. ENDGBV would also be required to collaborate with other city agencies to distribute such guidance.",
