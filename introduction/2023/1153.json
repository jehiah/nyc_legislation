  "Summary": "This bill would require the Commissioner of Social Services to produce two monthly reports, in consultation with the Police Commissioner, the Commissioner of Sanitation, and the Commissioner of Parks and Recreation. The first report would track each time a city agency worked to remove a person experiencing homelessness from a public space, including when the removal was coordinated among multiple agencies and when a person was asked to vacate a public space by a police officer. The second report would track how many individuals were affected by the removal, what housing services they were offered and whether there were any involuntary removals or arrests.",
