  "Summary": "This bill would permit for-hire vehicles to display digital advertising on an approved electronic tablet attached to the interior of the vehicle. The approved tablet would be capable of being turned on and off, muted, or having its volume adjusted by the passenger in the vehicle. No driver would be required to have a tablet in their vehicle or pay for the installation of a tablet in the vehicle they drive. It would also be unlawful for any service regulated by TLC to take negative action against any driver for choosing not to have an approved tablet in their car. Any driver of a for-hire vehicle with an approved tablet in their vehicle would receive 25 percent of the revenue generated by such tablet in their vehicle. TLC would license the persons who provide or supply the approved tablets.",
