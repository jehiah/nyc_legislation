  "Summary": "This bill would require the delivery worker bicycle safety course developed by the Department of Transportation (DOT) to cover the safe and lawful operation of powered bicycles, as well as lithium-ion battery and charging safety. In addition, it would require third-party delivery companies to provide their delivery workers with bicycle safety equipment, including protective headgear, a lamp, a bell or other signaling device, brakes, and reflective material.  It would also require third-party delivery companies to ensure that their delivery workers complete the bicycle safety course developed by DOT.",
