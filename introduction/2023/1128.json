  "Summary": "This bill would create a 5 year pilot program during which the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) would install real-time air quality monitors in commercial buildings. Participation in the pilot program would be voluntary, except that buildings receiving city financial assistance would be required to participate. Upon the conclusion of the program, DOHMH, in collaboration with the Department of Buildings (DOB), the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), and any other relevant agency, would be required to issue a report summarizing the data gathered and make recommendations to improve air quality in commercial buildings. DOHMH, DOB and DEP would also be permitted to make rules regarding the improvement of air quality in commercial buildings.",

If the owner or developer of any commercial building receives any city financial assistance after the effective date of this local law and before the end of the pilot program established pursuant to this local law, the agency administering such city financial assistance shall require the participation of the building in the pilot program as a condition of receiving the city financial assistance.\n      d. Real time indoor air quality monitoring. 1. The department of health and mental hygiene shall install real time indoor air quality monitors in all spaces regularly open to the public and, with the consent of commercial tenants, in spaces occupied by commercial tenants of the commercial buildings participating in the pilot program. \n      2. Such monitors shall be capable of measuring, at a minimum:\n      (a) Ambient temperature;\n      (b) Ambient humidity level;\n      (c) Carbon dioxide levels;\n      (d) Carbon monoxide levels;\n      (e) Levels of particulate pollution 2.5; and \n      (f) Levels of volatile organic compounds. \n      3.
