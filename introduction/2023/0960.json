  "Summary": "This bill would require all authorized emergency vehicles in New York City to be equipped with an additional siren, often called a rumbler, which emits a pulsating, low-frequency tone between 175 and 400 hertz to create vibrations that alert pedestrians and motorists to the presence of the emergency vehicle.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      Section 1. Section 24-241 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new subdivision (c) to read as follows:\n       (c) All authorized emergency vehicles shall be equipped with an emergency signal device that emits a pulsating, low-frequency tone between 175 and 400 hertz and can be operated simultaneously with the higher-frequency emergency signal device installed on such vehicles. Within one year after the effective date of this subdivision and every two years thereafter, emergency signal devices installed on authorized emergency vehicles shall be tested and certification shall be submitted, in a form approved by the department, that such devices meet the standard set forth in this subdivision. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, where compliance with the provisions of this subdivision would create an undue hardship, the owner or operator of an authorized emergency vehicle may submit a plan to the commissioner for emergency signal devices to meet the standard set forth in this subdivision within two years after the effective date of this subdivision.
