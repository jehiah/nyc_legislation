Section 24-241 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new subdivision (c) to read as follows:\n       (c) All authorized emergency vehicles shall be equipped with an emergency signal device that emits a pulsating, low-frequency tone between 175 and 400 hertz and can be operated simultaneously with the higher-frequency emergency signal device installed on such vehicles.
