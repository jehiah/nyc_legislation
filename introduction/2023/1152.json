  "Summary": "This bill would require the Mayor’s Office of Urban Agriculture, in conjunction with relevant agencies and local community programs, to create and implement a plan to convert unused industrial areas in each of the five boroughs to sites that can host urban agriculture services, including hydroponic farming, food storage, and food distribution.",
