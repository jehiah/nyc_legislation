  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Parks and Recreation, in consultation with any other appropriate City Departments, State Agencies or Authorities, and any interested non-governmental parties, to create an Urban Forest Master Plan which would be aimed at protecting and increasing the City’s urban forest. It would be aimed at increasing tree and vegetation cover across the City and requires the establishment of goals to expand and protect the urban forest. The plan would be required to be updated every five years. It would also require the City to collect LIDaR data to monitor the effectiveness of the plan.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Chapter 1 of title 18 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new section 18-159, to read as follows:  \n      � 18-159 Urban forest master plan. a. For the purposes of this section the following terms have the following meanings: \n      Light detection and ranging. The term \"light detection and ranging\" means a form of measuring variable distances to Earth from the air using a laser or other light source to gather three-dimensional information about surface characteristics of the Earth. \n      Urban forest. The term \"urban forest\" means all the trees or shade creating vegetation contained within New York City, including those not under the ownership or jurisdiction of the commissioner. \n      b. The department shall develop an urban forest master plan that identifies strategies and sets goals to protect, care for, and expand the city's urban forest canopy with an overall goal at expanding the cover provided by the city's urban forest to 30% of land within the city. \n      c. In the development of such master plan, the department shall work in collaboration with any city agency, state agency, public authority, or person who the commissioner or department deems to have appropriate information or expertise to assist in the master plan's development.\n      d. Such master plan shall: \n      1. Consider existing data to evaluate the holistic health and stability of the city's urban forest as a whole; \n      2. Identify the causes of the loss of urban forest or reductions of tree canopy cover and recommend strategies to remediate any urban forest losses and prevent similar losses in the future; \n      3. Establish goals for expanding and protecting the city's urban forest; \n      4. Describe any initiatives or programs to be undertaken by the city to reach the goals outlined in the master plan; and \n      5. Include an outreach plan to educate real property owners, by providing them with information and strategies on how they can protect and expand the trees and vegetation on their property to advance the goals set forth in the master plan. \n      e. No later than July 31, 2025 and at least once every three years thereafter the department shall collect light detection and ranging data to monitor the canopy coverage of the city's urban forest and measure the growth or loss of any cover against the metrics set out in the master plan and track progress towards the overall urban forest canopy goal pursuant to subdivision b.\n      f. Nothing in this section shall require the commissioner to take ownership or control of any tree not already under the commissioner's jurisdiction.\n      g. The commissioner shall submit such master plan to the mayor and the speaker of the council no later than July 31, 2024, and shall post it on the website of the department. Such master plan shall be updated every ten years after the initial master plan. \n      � 2.
