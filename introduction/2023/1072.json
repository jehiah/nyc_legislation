  "Summary": "This bill would reduce the required housing history from two years to one year in order for families with children to demonstrate their eligibility for entry into the Department of Homeless Services (DHS) shelter system. It would additionally require DHS staff to upload all documents relevant to an applicant’s housing history to a digital case record and communicate with an applicant about any missing documents through electronic methods. This bill would give families with children at least thirty days in temporary shelter pending a determination of their eligibility for shelter, subject to the approval of the State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance. This bill would also require DHS to create an informational pamphlet listing examples of documents that could demonstrate proof of housing history and ensure that such pamphlet is posted online and distributed to families with children at the PATH intake center.",
