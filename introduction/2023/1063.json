  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DoITT), also known as the Office of Technology and Innovation (OTI), to create a mobile app with information about the locations of each electric vehicle charging station imposed on a map of the city, the voltage, charging level, and electric vehicle connector types provided by each station, whether each station can be used to charge e-bikes, and, to the extent the city has or can reasonably obtain such information, a real time display indicating whether each station is available or in use. The app will allow users to filer the electric vehicle charging stations based on such information.",
