  "Summary": "This bill would require the department of transportation to conduct a study on the impact of last mile facilities on the street infrastructure and communities they are situated in, including estimating the amount of delivery vehicles arriving at or departing from each facility, and the impact that additional vehicle traffic has on parking, street congestion, vehicle collisions and other traffic incidents.",

No later than 2 years after the effective date of this local law, the department shall submit to the speaker of the council, and post conspicuously on the department's website, a report on the impact that delivery vehicle traffic generated by last mile facilities have on the communities they are situated in.
