  "Summary": "This bill would establish a task force to study the disparity in contracting between city vendors who are awarded contracts and available community-based vendors. The task force would be required to identify circumstances where city agencies could offer improved services by contracting with community-based vendors and make recommendations to the Mayor on ways to increase contracting with community-based vendors when such vendors could offer improved services. The task force would also be responsible for submitting a report to the Mayor and Speaker on its findings.",
