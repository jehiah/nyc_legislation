The plan would need to prioritize playgrounds that are located in environmental justice areas and include, for the upcoming year, a list of at least 25 school playgrounds that could be maintained and operated by DPR and DOE and used by the public on weekends and after school hours, a list of the duties of DPR and DOE in relation to increasing the number of playgrounds available to the public, the estimated budget required, and any challenges with implementing the plan.",
