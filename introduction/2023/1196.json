  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) to visit a unit to observe a condition alleged in a housing complaint. If HPD is not able to enter the premises to observe the alleged condition, HPD would be required to post a notice on the door of the unit and to visit the unit again on a different day to attempt entry. If HPD cannot enter the unit after the second attempt, HPD would be required to call and send a text message to the tenant to schedule an appointment to visit the unit. If HPD is unable to reach the tenant by phone or text message, HPD would be required to categorize the housing complaint as “unresolved.” HPD would only be permitted to categorize a housing complaint as “closed” when HPD verifies that a condition has been fixed, a condition does not exist or the housing complaint has otherwise been resolved.",
