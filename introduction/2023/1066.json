  "Summary": "Local Law 84 of 2013 requires the Mayor’s Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability to create a long term sustainability plan with goals for certain categories (i.e., air quality, energy, climate change, coastal protection, etc.) as well as tracking sustainability indicators for those categories. That plan is released every 4 years.  This bill would require Local Law 84’s planning to consider the role of trees in its long-term sustainability planning in addition to the other factors it already measures.",
