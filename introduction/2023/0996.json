  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to provide blood pressure machines in high need publicly accessible areas throughout the city. The bill would also require DOHMH to post on their website the public places where such machines are located as well as instructions on the use and operation of the blood pressure machines. Providing free, blood pressure machines for public use would enable citizens, especially un- and under-insured, at-risk individuals, to routinely monitor their blood pressures and possibly encourage them to seek medical treatment, or make life changes to lower their blood pressures in the event self-testing consistently reveals elevated levels.",
