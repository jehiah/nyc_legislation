  "Summary": "This bill would prohibit knowingly leasing commercial premises to a tenant who uses the premises for the distribution or sale of controlled substances or tobacco products without a license. The first time that an unlicensed controlled substance or unlicensed tobacco product seller is found to be operating in leased commercial premises, the Sheriff, Police Department, or any other relevant agency would issue a warning to the owner of the premises. If an unlicensed seller is later found to be operating in the same commercial premises, the owner would be liable for civil penalties. This bill would also require the Sheriff, in collaboration with the police department and any other relevant agency, to submit to the Mayor and the Council a monthly report on enforcement relating to unlicensed controlled substances or unlicensed tobacco product sellers.",
