  "Summary": "This bill would require city agencies to create and submit to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council a fair housing assessment and plan every five years. The assessment would include a citywide fair housing plan that would be coordinated with the requirements of the federal Fair Housing Act and be due by October 1, 2025. One year later, the administering agency would submit an assessment of long-term citywide housing needs, five-year production targets distributed to the community district level, and a strategic equity framework that would report on the progress made towards the housing production targets set, obstacles and strategies for furthering fair housing across community districts, focusing on preservation of affordable housing, anti-displacement resources and neighborhood investments for underserved communities. Annually, a report would have to be submitted on the progress made by the City towards implementing the strategies set out in both parts of the housing assessment.",
