  "Summary": "Employers are increasingly requiring their employees to sign non-compete agreements as a condition of employment, even in low-wage jobs where such provisions do not serve an obvious purpose. These covenants can lead to low-wage employees being unreasonably restricted in finding new jobs. This bill would prohibit employers from requiring low-wage employees to enter into covenants not to compete as a condition of their employment.",
