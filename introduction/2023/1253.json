  "Summary": "This bill would allow vendors to place their pushcarts two feet from the curb unless there is an obstruction in or on the sidewalk, in which case it would allow vendors to place their pushcarts as close as possible to the obstruction. Currently, the law requires pushcarts to abut the curb, endangering the safety of vendors who must exit their carts onto the street, and potentially, into oncoming traffic.",

[In no event shall any pushcart be placed on any part of a sidewalk other than that which abuts the curb.] All pushcarts on the sidewalk must be placed within two feet from the curb. Where an obstruction prevents such placement, pushcarts must be placed as close as possible to the obstruction.\n\t� 2. Subdivision a of section 20-465 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows: \n\ta. No general vendor shall engage in any vending business on any sidewalk unless such sidewalk has at least a twelve-foot wide clear pedestrian path to be measured from the boundary of any private property to any obstructions in or on the sidewalk, or if there are no obstructions, to the curb.
