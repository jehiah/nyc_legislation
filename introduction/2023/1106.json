Employers with five or more employees or employers of one or more domestic worker would be required to provide all employees with personal time for absences from work for any reason. Like paid safe/sick time, employers would provide employees with one hour of personal time for every 30 hours worked by an employee, with a maximum of 80 hours of personal time in any calendar year.",

Employees who are exempt from the overtime requirements of New York state law or regulations, including the wage orders promulgated by the New York commissioner of labor pursuant to article 19 or 19-A of the labor law, shall be assumed to work forty hours in each work week for purposes of safe/sick time and personal time accrual unless their regular work week is less than forty hours, in which case [safe/sick] time accrues based upon that regular work week. \n      f. The provisions of this chapter do not apply to (i) work study programs under 42 U.S.C. section 2753, (ii) employees for the hours worked and compensated by or through qualified scholarships as defined in 26 U.S.C. section 117, (iii) independent contractors who do not meet the definition of employee under section 190(2) of the labor law, and (iv) [hourly professional employees] exempt licensed providers of education related services. \n      g.

Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as requiring financial or other reimbursement to an employee from an employer upon the employee's termination, resignation, retirement, or other separation from employment for accrued safe/sick time or personal time that has not been used.\n      j. If an employee is transferred to a separate division, entity or location in the city of New York, but remains employed by the same employer, such employee is entitled to all safe/sick time and personal time accrued at the prior division, entity or location and is entitled to retain or use all safe/sick time and personal time as provided pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. When there is a separation from employment and the employee is rehired within six months of separation by the same employer, previously accrued safe/sick time and personal time that was not used shall be reinstated and such employee shall be entitled to use such accrued [safe/sick] time at any time after such employee is rehired, provided that no employer shall be required to reinstate such [safe/sick] time to the extent the employee was paid for unused accrued [safe/sick] time prior to separation and the employee agreed to accept such pay for such unused [safe/sick] time. \n      � 20-914.

For safe time used pursuant to this subdivision, documentation signed by an employee, agent, or volunteer of a victim services organization, an attorney, a member of the clergy, or a medical or other professional service provider from whom the employee or that employee's family member has sought assistance in addressing family offense matters, sex offenses, stalking, or human trafficking and their effects; a police or court record; or a notarized letter from the employee explaining the need for such time shall be considered reasonable documentation and an employer shall not require that such documentation specify the details of the family offense matter, sexual offense, stalking, or human trafficking.\n      c. An employer may require reasonable notice of the need to use safe/sick time or COVID-19 child vaccination time. Where such need is foreseeable, an employer may require reasonable advance notice of the intention to use such time, not to exceed seven days prior to the date such usage of time is to begin. Where such need is not foreseeable, an employer may require an employee to provide notice of the need for the use of such time as soon as practicable.\n      c-1. Personal time. 1. An employee shall be entitled to use personal time for absence from work for any reason, including but not limited to the reasons described in paragraphs a, b and c of this subdivision.\n      2. An employee shall not be required to provide documentation for the use of personal time authorized by this subdivision.\n      c-2. An employer may require reasonable notice [of the need] to use safe/sick time or personal time. \n      1. Where the use of safe/sick time or personal time is not foreseeable, an employer may require an employee to provide notice of the use of such time as soon as practicable.\n      2. Where the use of safe/sick time is foreseeable, an employer may require reasonable advance notice of the intention to use such safe/sick time, not to exceed seven days prior to the date such safe/sick time is to begin.\n      3. Where the use of personal time is foreseeable, an employer may require reasonable advance notice of the intention to use such time, not to exceed fourteen days prior to the date such time is to begin, unless otherwise provided by rules promulgated by the commissioner. Such rules shall be designed to enable employers to ensure the continuity and effectiveness of their operations without unduly restricting the ability of employees to enjoy the rights provided under this chapter. An employer may establish and enforce policies concerning reasonable advance notice for use of personal time and the right to deny such requests consistent with such rules, provided that the notice requirements and circumstances in which an employer may deny a request are clearly described in an employer's written policies, that such policies are disseminated to all affected employees, and that such policies are applied consistently and in a nondiscriminatory manner. \n      d. Nothing herein shall prevent an employer from requiring an employee to provide written confirmation that an employee used safe/sick time or personal time pursuant to this section. \n      e. An employer shall not require an employee, as a condition of taking safe/sick time, personal time or COVID-19 child vaccination time, to search for or find a replacement worker to cover the hours during which such employee is utilizing time.\n      f. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit an employer from taking disciplinary action, up to and including termination, against a worker who uses safe/sick time provided pursuant to this chapter for purposes other than those described in this section or uses COVID-19 child vaccination time provided pursuant to this chapter for purposes other than those described in section 20-914.1.\n      � 20-914.1 COVID-19 child vaccination time. a. An employee who is a parent of a child under the age of 18, or the parent of an older child who is incapable of self-care because of a mental or physical disability, shall be entitled to four hours of COVID-19 child vaccination time per vaccine injection, for each such child, for an absence from work due to any of the following reasons associated with such child's COVID-19 vaccination:\n            1.   Accompanying such child to receive a COVID-19 vaccine injection; or\n            2.   Caring for such child who is experiencing temporary side effects from a COVID-19 vaccine injection.\n         b. COVID-19 child vaccination time shall be paid at an employee's regular rate of pay at the time the time is taken, provided that the rate of pay shall not be less than the highest applicable rate of pay to which the employee would be entitled pursuant to subdivision 1 of section 652 of the labor law, or any other applicable federal, state, or local law, rule, contract, or agreement. Such rate of pay shall be calculated without allowing for any tip credit or tip allowance set forth in any federal, state, or local law, rule, contract, or agreement and shall not be charged against an employee's accrual or use of safe/sick time under this chapter. COVID-19 child vaccination time must be paid no later than the payday for the next regular payroll period beginning after the COVID-19 child vaccination time was used by the employee.\n         c. An employer may require that within seven days of an employee's use of COVID-19 child vaccination time, the employee provide reasonable documentation that the child for whose care the COVID-19 vaccine time is claimed has received a COVID-19 vaccine injection.\n         d.   An employer shall not require an employee to work additional hours to make up for the original hours for which such employee was absent or to search for or find a replacement employee to cover the hours during which the employee is absent pursuant to this section.\n      � 20-915. Changing schedule. Upon mutual consent of the employee and the employer, an employee who is absent for a reason listed in subdivision a of section 20-914 of this chapter may work additional hours during the immediately preceding seven days if the absence was foreseeable or within the immediately subsequent seven days from that absence without using safe/sick time or personal time to make up for the original hours for which such employee was absent, provided that an adjunct professor who is an employee at an institute of higher education may work such additional hours at any time during the academic term. An employer shall not require such employee to work additional hours to make up for the original hours for which such employee was absent or to search for or find a replacement employee to cover the hours during which the employee is absent pursuant to this section. If such employee works additional hours, and such hours are fewer than the number of hours such employee was originally scheduled to work, then such employee shall be able to use safe/sick time or personal time provided pursuant to this chapter for the difference. Should the employee work additional hours, the employer shall comply with any applicable federal, state or local labor laws. \n      � 20-916. Collective bargaining agreements. a. The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to any employee covered by a valid collective bargaining agreement if (i) such provisions are expressly waived in such collective bargaining agreement and (ii) such agreement provides for a comparable benefit for the employees covered by such agreement in the form of paid days off; such paid days off shall be in the form of leave, compensation, other employee benefits, or some combination thereof. Comparable benefits shall include, but are not limited to, vacation time, personal time, [safe/sick] safe time, sick time, and holiday and Sunday time pay at premium rates. \n      b. Notwithstanding subdivision a of this section, the provisions of this chapter shall not apply to any employee in the construction or grocery industry covered by a valid collective bargaining agreement if such provisions are expressly waived in such collective bargaining agreement.\n      c.   Notwithstanding subdivisions a and b of this section, the requirement to provide COVID-19 child vaccination time as set forth in section 20-914.1 cannot be waived.\n      � 20-917. Public disasters. In the event of a public disaster, the mayor may, for the length of such disaster, suspend the provisions of this chapter for businesses, corporations or other entities regulated by the public service commission. \n      � 20-918. Retaliation and interference prohibited. a. No person shall interfere with any investigation, proceeding or hearing pursuant to this chapter.\n      b.   No person shall take any adverse action against an employee that penalizes an employee for, or is reasonably likely to deter an employee from, exercising or attempting to exercise rights under this chapter or interfere with an employee's exercise of rights under this chapter and implementing rules.\n      c. Adverse actions include, but are not limited to, threats, intimidation, discipline, discharge, demotion, suspension, harassment, discrimination, reduction in hours or pay, informing another employer of an employee's exercise of rights under this chapter, blacklisting, and maintenance or application of an absence control policy that counts protected leave for safe/sick time or COVID-19 child vaccination time as an absence that may lead to or result in an adverse action. Adverse actions include actions related to perceived immigration status or work authorization.\n      d. An employee need not explicitly refer to a provision of this chapter or implementing rules to be protected from an adverse action.\n      e. The protections of this section shall apply to any person who mistakenly but in good faith asserts their rights or alleges a violation of this chapter.\n      f. A causal connection between the exercise, attempted exercise, or anticipated exercise of rights protected by this chapter and implementing rules and an employer's adverse action against an employee or a group of employees may be established by indirect or direct evidence.\n      g. For purposes of subdivision b of this section, a violation is established when it is shown that a protected activity was a motivating factor for an adverse action, whether or not other factors motivated the adverse action.\n      � 20-919. Notice of rights. a. 1. An employer shall provide an employee with written notice of such employee's right to safe/sick time and personal time pursuant to this chapter, including the accrual and use of [safe/sick] safe time, sick time and personal time, the calendar year of the employer, and the right to be free from retaliation and to file a complaint with the department. Such notice shall be in English and the primary language spoken by that employee, provided that the department has made available a translation of such notice in such language pursuant to subdivision b of this section. Such notice shall also be conspicuously posted at an employer's place of business in an area accessible to employees. \n      2. Such notice shall be provided to each employee at the commencement of employment. For employees who were already employed prior to the effective dates of provisions of this chapter establishing their right to safe/sick time, such notice shall be provided within thirty days of the effective date of the local law that established each such right.\n      b. The department shall create and make available notices that contain the information required pursuant to subdivision a of this section concerning safe/sick time and personal time and such notices shall allow for the employer to fill in applicable dates for such employer's calendar year. Such notices shall be posted in a downloadable format on the department's website in Chinese, English, French-Creole, Italian, Korean, Russian, Spanish and any other language deemed appropriate by the department. \n      c.   The amount of safe/sick time accrued and used during a pay period and an employee's total balance of accrued safe/sick time shall be noted on a pay statement or other form of written documentation provided to the employee each pay period.\n      d.   Any person or entity that willfully violates the notice requirements of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed fifty dollars for each employee who was not given appropriate notice pursuant to this section.\n      � 20-920. Employer records. Employers shall make and retain records documenting such employer's compliance with the requirements of this chapter for a period of three years unless otherwise required pursuant to any other law, rule or regulation, and shall allow the department to access such records, with appropriate notice and at a mutually agreeable time of day, in furtherance of an investigation conducted pursuant to this chapter.\n      � 20-921. Confidentiality and nondisclosure. a. An employer may not require the disclosure of details relating to an employee's or his or her family member's medical condition or require the disclosure of details relating to an employee's or his or her family member's status as a victim of domestic violence, family offenses, sexual offenses, stalking, or human trafficking as a condition of providing safe/sick time under this chapter. Health information about an employee or an employee's family member, and information concerning an employee's or his or her family member's status or perceived status as a victim of domestic violence, family offenses, sexual offenses, stalking or human trafficking obtained solely for the purposes of utilizing safe/sick time pursuant to this chapter, shall be treated as confidential and shall not be disclosed except by the affected employee, with the written permission of the affected employee or as required by law. Provided, however, that nothing in this section shall preclude an employer from considering information provided in connection with a request for safe time in connection with a request for reasonable accommodation pursuant to subdivision 27 of section 8-107.\n� 20-922. Encouragement of more generous policies; no effect on more generous policies.\n      a. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to discourage or prohibit the adoption or retention of a safe/sick time policy, personal time policy, or COVID-19 child vaccination time policy more generous than that which is required herein.\n      b. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as diminishing the obligation of an employer to comply with any contract, collective bargaining agreement, employment benefit plan or other agreement providing more generous safe/sick sick time, personal time or COVID-19 child vaccination time to an employee than required herein. \n      c. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as diminishing the rights of public employees regarding safe/sick time, personal time or COVID-19 child vaccination time as provided pursuant to federal, state or city law.\n      � 20-923. Other legal requirements. a. This chapter provides minimum requirements pertaining to safe/sick time, personal time and COVID-19 child vaccination time and shall not be construed to preempt, limit or otherwise affect the applicability of any other law, regulation, rule, requirement, policy or standard that provides for greater accrual or use by employees of safe/sick time, personal time or COVID-19 child vaccination time, whether paid or unpaid, or that extends other protections to employees. \n      b. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as creating or imposing any requirement in conflict with any federal or state law, rule or regulation, nor shall anything in this chapter be construed to diminish or impair the rights of an employee or employer under any valid collective bargaining agreement.\n      c. Where section 196-b of the labor law, or any regulation issued thereunder, sets forth a standard or requirement for minimum hour or use of safe/sick time that exceeds any provision in this chapter, such standard or requirement shall be incorporated by reference and shall be enforceable by the department in the manner set forth in this chapter and subject to the penalties and remedies set forth in the labor law.\n      � 20-924. Enforcement and penalties. a. The department shall enforce the provisions of this chapter. In effectuating such enforcement, the department shall establish a system utilizing multiple means of communication to receive complaints regarding non-compliance with this chapter and investigate complaints received by the department in a timely manner. The department may open an investigation upon receipt of a complaint or on its own initiative.\n      b.   Any person alleging a violation of this chapter shall have the right to file a complaint with the department within two years of the date the person knew or should have known of the alleged violation. The department shall maintain confidential the identity of any natural person providing information relevant to enforcement of this chapter unless disclosure of such person's identity is necessary to the department for resolution of its investigation or otherwise required by federal or state law. The department shall, to the extent practicable, notify such person that the department will be disclosing his or her identity prior to such disclosure.\n      c. Upon receiving a complaint alleging a violation of this chapter, the department shall investigate such complaint. Within fourteen days of written notification of an investigation by the department, the person or entity under investigation shall provide the department with a written response and such other information as the department may request. The department shall keep complainants reasonably notified regarding the status of their complaint and any resultant investigation. If, as a result of an investigation of a complaint or an investigation conducted upon its own initiative, the department believes that a violation has occurred, it shall issue to the offending person or entity a notice of violation. The commissioner shall prescribe the form and wording of such notices of violation. The notice of violation shall be returnable to the administrative tribunal authorized to adjudicate violations of this chapter.\n      d. The department shall have the power to impose penalties provided for in this chapter and to grant each and every employee or former employee all appropriate relief. Such relief shall include: (i) for each instance of safe/sick time or personal time taken by an employee but unlawfully not compensated by the employer: three times the wages that should have been paid under this chapter or two hundred fifty dollars, whichever is greater; (ii) for each instance of safe/sick time or personal time requested by an employee but unlawfully denied by the employer and not taken by the employee or unlawfully conditioned upon searching for or finding a replacement worker, or for each instance an employer requires an employee to work additional hours without the mutual consent of such employer and employee in violation of section 20-915 of this chapter to make up for the original hours during which such employee is absent pursuant to this chapter: five hundred dollars; (iii) for each instance of unlawful retaliation not including discharge from employment: full compensation including wages and benefits lost, five hundred dollars and equitable relief as appropriate; [and] (iv) for each instance of unlawful discharge from employment: full compensation including wages and benefits lost, two thousand five hundred dollars and equitable relief, including reinstatement, as appropriate; (v) for each employee covered by an employer's official or unofficial policy or practice of not providing or refusing to allow the use of accrued safe/sick time in violation of section 20-913, five hundred dollars; (vi) for each instance of COVID-19 child vaccination time taken by an employee but unlawfully not compensated by the employer, three times the wages that should have been paid under this chapter or two hundred fifty dollars, whichever is greater; and (vii) for each instance of COVID-19 child vaccination time unlawfully denied or charged against an employee's paid safe/sick time accruals, five hundred dollars. \n      e. Any entity or person found to be in violation of the provisions of sections 20-913, 20-914, 20-914.1, 20-915 or 20-918 of this chapter shall be liable for a civil penalty payable to the city not to exceed five hundred dollars for the first violation and, for subsequent violations that occur within two years of any previous violation, not to exceed seven hundred fifty dollars for the second violation and not to exceed one thousand dollars for each succeeding violation. Penalties shall be imposed on a per employee basis.\n      f. The department shall annually report on its website the number and nature of the complaints received pursuant to this chapter, the results of investigations undertaken pursuant to this chapter, including the number of complaints not substantiated and the number of notices of violations issued, the number and nature of adjudications pursuant to this chapter, and the average time for a complaint to be resolved pursuant to this chapter. \n      � 20-924.1 Enforcement by the corporation counsel. The corporation counsel or such other persons designated by the corporation counsel on behalf of the department may initiate in any court of competent jurisdiction any action or proceeding that may be appropriate or necessary for the enforcement of any order issued by the department pursuant to this chapter or for the correction of any violation issued pursuant to section 20-924, including actions to mandate compliance with the provisions of such order, secure permanent injunctions, enjoining any acts or practices that constitute such violation, mandating compliance with the provisions of this chapter or such other relief as may be appropriate.\n      � 20-924.2 Civil action by corporation counsel for pattern or practice of violations. a.

Where reasonable cause exists to believe that an employer is engaged in a pattern or practice of violations of this chapter, the corporation counsel or such other persons designated by the corporation counsel may commence a civil action on behalf of the city in a court of competent jurisdiction.\n      2. The corporation counsel or such other persons designated by the corporation counsel shall commence such action by filing a complaint setting forth facts relating to such pattern or practice and requesting relief, which may include injunctive relief, civil penalties and any other appropriate relief.\n      3. Nothing in this section prohibits the department from exercising its authority under section 20-924 or the city charter, provided that a civil action pursuant to this section shall not have previously been commenced.\n      b. Investigation. The corporation counsel may initiate any investigation to ascertain such facts as may be necessary for the commencement of a civil action pursuant to subdivision a of this section, and in connection therewith shall have the power to issue subpoenas to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents, to administer oaths and to examine such persons as are deemed necessary.\n      c. Civil penalties and relief for employees. In any civil action commenced pursuant to subdivision a of this section, the trier of fact may impose a civil penalty of not more than $15,000 for a finding that an employer has engaged in a pattern or practice of violations of this chapter.
