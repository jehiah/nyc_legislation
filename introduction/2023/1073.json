  "Summary": "This bill would require the Commission on Racial Equity to establish a Truth, Healing, and Reconciliation process in connection with the City’s historic involvement in slavery. The process’s objectives would be to establish historical facts about slavery in the City of New York; to protect, acknowledge, and empower affected persons and communities; and to recommend changes for government and institutions to prevent recurrence and perpetuation of harm. The Commission would be required to hold public proceedings and conduct public engagement activities to support the process, and to publish a report documenting its findings and recommendations.",

  "Text": "Be it enacted by the Council as follows:\n      \n      \n      Section 1. Title 8 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new chapter 11 to read as follows:\nCHAPTER 11\nTRUTH, HEALING, AND RECONCILIATION\n      � 8-1101 Legislative findings. a. The council hereby finds that from 1626 to 1827, the city of New York was the site of the wrongful but legally sanctioned enslavement of human beings of African and indigenous American descent; that in the early 1700s, the city of New York had one of the highest rates of slave ownership in the country, with between 15 and 20 percent of New Yorkers enslaved and deprived of their fundamental human rights; that after slavery was banned in the state in 1827, the city of New York continued to generate significant income from the illegal international trade of enslaved persons; and that racially motivated discrimination, riots, segregation, and violence continued after the United States formally abolished slavery in 1865, including through racially discriminatory laws, policies, and practices. \n      b. The council further finds that on November 8, 2022, New Yorkers voted to adopt a new preamble to the charter acknowledging \"the grave injustices and atrocities that form part of our country's history, including the forced labor of enslaved Africans\" and \"the discrimination, racial segregation, mass incarceration, and other forms of violence and systemic inequity that continue to be experienced by marginalized groups.\" The preamble also acknowledges that these systemic injustices continue to cause profound harms to individuals, families, and communities, and that \"[w]e must act intentionally to remedy these past and continuing harms and to reconstruct, revise and reimagine our foundations, structures, institutions, and laws to promote justice and equity for all New Yorkers.\" \n      c. The council further finds that on November 8, 2022, when the preamble to the charter was approved, New Yorkers voted to affirm that \"We, the people of New York city, united in our resolve to build a just and equitable city for all, recognize the efforts of those New Yorkers, past and present, who fought for racial equity and social justice, honor the contributions of those New Yorkers who have suffered in the name of freedom, and acknowledge all who fought, struggled, and dreamed for a better life and a better city. Together, we stand on their shoulders as we move boldly toward a brighter tomorrow for ourselves, our children, and future generations.\" \n      d. Therefore, the council intends by this chapter to create a truth, healing, and reconciliation process, through which New Yorkers can publicly name and acknowledge the past, present, and ongoing harms and traumas caused by and associated with slavery and its legacies in the city of New York; and by which these grave harms and injustices can be publicly recognized, memorialized, and formally repudiated; and through which New Yorkers may ensure accountability for such harms and injustices, including by ensuring that such harms and injustices are not forgotten, perpetuated, or repeated; and through which the city may take action to repair relationships and social bonds amongst all New Yorkers. \n      � 8-1102 Definitions. As used in this chapter, the following terms have the following meanings: \n      Affected person or community. The terms \"affected person\" and \"affected community\" mean a person and a group of people, respectively, that have experienced harm or injustice as a result of the legacies, badges, and aftereffects of slavery, or whose ancestors were subjected to slavery. \n      Commission.

The term \"public forum\" means a building or other physical location where, in accordance with rules promulgated by the commission, members of the public may learn about and engage with the history, personal experiences, and past or ongoing harms and injustices related to slavery.\n      Racial equity. The term \"racial equity\" means, when referring to an outcome, the achievement of equity with a particular focus on race or the intersection of race with other characteristics of identity. When referring to a process, the term \"racial equity\" means the closing of gaps in policy, practice, and allocation of city resources through the prioritization of access, opportunities, and resources to persons and communities who, based on or at least in part due to race, have historically faced or currently face marginalization or oppression, underinvestment, disinvestment, or under-resourcing.\n      Reconciliation. The term \"reconciliation\" means an ongoing process of establishing and maintaining respectful societal relationships rooted in the acknowledgement of historical truths, universal human dignity, and the shared pursuit of racial equity.\n      Slavery. The term \"slavery\" means the legally sanctioned, race-based practice in New York of enslaving Black and indigenous American persons between the years 1626 and 1827, and the effects, legacies, badges, and aftereffects of that practice. \n      Truth and reconciliation. The term \"truth and reconciliation\" means public proceedings, including but not limited to public hearings and research efforts, conducted for the purpose of investigating and recording serious human rights violations and abuses with the goal of achieving genuine healing, reconciliation, and progress toward a more just and equitable society. Such proceedings seek to establish patterns, practices, and chains of command that reveal the purposeful and systematic nature of such violations and abuses, potentially but not necessarily in concert with or in anticipation of reparative or restorative justice efforts.\n      � 8-1103 Truth and reconciliation process established. a. Objectives. The commission shall establish a truth and reconciliation process with the following objectives:\n      1.
