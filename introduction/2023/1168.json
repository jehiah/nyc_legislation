  "Summary": "This bill would establish safety standards for powered bicycles and powered mobility devices when used for food delivery services. Specifically, the bill requires that any powered mobility device operated by a food delivery worker on behalf of a third-party delivery service or third-party courier service, meet local standards established for the sale of such device, which includes certification by an accredited testing laboratory.  Third-party delivery services or third-party courier services would be responsible for providing food delivery workers with such devices at no expense to the worker. Finally, responsibility for compliance with these provisions would fall on the third-party delivery service or third-party courier service, which would be subject to civil penalties for any violations.",
