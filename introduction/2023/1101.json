  "Summary": "This bill would require the Chief Equity Officer, in consultation with key stakeholders, to create an anti-racism training for employees of human services contractors. The purpose of such training would be to improve the provision of human services in the City by (1) providing contractors with tools for serving individuals from diverse backgrounds, (2) improving awareness of, and sensitivity to, how racism and related injustices impact the provision of human services, and (3) promoting policies, practices, and norms designed to combat racism and advance racial equity in the provision of human services. Each employee of a human services contractor would be required to complete such training annually. As an alternative, human services contractors would be able to meet this requirement by offering their own anti-racism training curriculum, where approved by the Chief Equity Officer.",
