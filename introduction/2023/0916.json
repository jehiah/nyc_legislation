  "Summary": "This bill would require the Police Department to conduct an outreach campaign to inform the public about the department’s gun buy-back programs, whereby individuals may voluntarily and anonymously surrender to the department a working or non-working unloaded gun or parts thereof, in exchange for a sum of money to be determined by the department upon surrender. The Police Department would be required to consult with the Office to Prevent Gun Violence and relevant community organizations to conduct such outreach campaign. As part of the outreach campaign, the Police Department would be required to implement a media campaign that would be available on the internet, television, radio and in print, and would be required to maintain on its website and update as needed information about gun buy-back programs.",
