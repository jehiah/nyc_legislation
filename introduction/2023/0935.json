  "Summary": "This bill would require general contractors to be licensed by the Department of Buildings (DOB) in a manner similar to how other trades are licensed under DOB, and would prohibit any person from performing general contractor work unless approved by DOB. Applicants for permits from DOB must be licensed general contractors who are “designees” of approved general contracting businesses or, with respect to work performed by city agencies, the “designees” of such agencies. This bill would require applicants for a general contractor license from DOB to meet certain qualifications, including, but not limited to, possessing a valid Site Safety Training Supervisor Card.",
