  "Summary": "This bill would remove certain criteria that the Department of Social Services (DSS) currently uses to determine whether a household that is neither living in shelter nor experiencing street homelessness is eligible for a CityFHEPS rental assistance voucher. Specifically, the bill would disallow DSS from using the preservation of a rent-controlled apartment or receiving adult protective services as a criteria to determine eligibility for CityFHEPS. Additionally, the bill would provide households with the opportunity to demonstrate risk of eviction with a rent demand letter as a means to meet eligibility for CityFHEPS.",
