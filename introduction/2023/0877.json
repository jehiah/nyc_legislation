  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) to create a comprehensive exit survey and interview protocol designed to gather feedback from resigning and retiring municipal employees in regard to their experience in the City’s civil service. Agencies would be required to offer both an electronic exit survey to all resigning and retiring employees and an in-person exit interview to a set percentage of resigning and retiring employees based on the agency’s size. Exit surveys and interviews would be completed on a voluntary basis and would be administered by the employing agency on or before the employee’s last day of employment. Beginning March 30, 2025, and annually thereafter, DCAS would be required to submit a report to the Equal Employment Practices Commission and the Speaker summarizing the responses received in exit surveys and interviews.",
