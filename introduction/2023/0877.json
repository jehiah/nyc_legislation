  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS), in consultation with the New York City Commission on Human Rights (CHR), to create an exit survey designed to gather feedback from resigning and retiring municipal employees in regard to their experience in the civil service. Exit surveys would be administered by the employing agency on or before the employee’s last day of employment, and the responses to such surveys would be provided to DCAS. Beginning March 30, 2024, and annually thereafter, DCAS would be required to submit a report to CHR and the Speaker regarding resigning and retiring employees and the responses received in exit surveys.",
