  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Education (DOE) to submit to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council and post on its website an annual report on the provision of menstrual products to students in any facility that is leased by DOE or over which DOE has care, custody and control, in which there is a public school, including a charter school, serving students who menstruate in grades six through twelve. Each year, DOE would be required to report the number of such facilities that provided only one type of menstrual product to students; the number of schools that provided two or more types of menstrual products to students; the number of bathrooms or areas in each school where menstrual products were made available to students, including how they were dispensed and made available; and the number of schools that did not provide menstrual products to students, and the reasons therefor. This bill would also require that all laws, documents and materials generated by the City use the term “menstrual products” whenever referring to products for use in connection with the menstrual cycle such as menstrual cups, tampons, and menstrual pads.",
