  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Education to submit to the Mayor and the Speaker of the Council and post on its website an annual report on the provision of menstrual products to students in any facility that is leased by the department or over which the department has care, custody and control, in which there is a public school, including a charter school, serving female students in grades six through twelve. The report would need to include, for the previous year, the number of schools that provided only one type of menstrual product to students, the number of schools that provided two or more types of menstrual products to students, the number of bathrooms or areas in each school where the products were made available to students, including how they were dispensed and made available, and the number of schools that did not provide menstrual products to students, and the reasons why they were not provided. This bill would also require that all laws, documents and materials generated by the City use the term “menstrual products” whenever referring to products such as menstrual cups, tampons and sanitary napkins for use in connection with the menstrual cycle.",
