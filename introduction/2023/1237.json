  "Summary": "This bill would require any city agency that directly, or by contract, collects demographic information through form documents from individuals seeking social services in the city to offer all such individuals a standardized and voluntary survey form that contains a demographic question on whether such person or any member of their household has served in the armed forces, national guard, or reserves of the United States and an option for any person who responds affirmatively to such question to consent to being contacted by the Department of Veterans Services (DVS) regarding services and resources for veterans. This bill would also require DVS to compile all survey data collected and submit a report to the speaker on the total number of veterans who have responded affirmatively to the veteran status question disaggregated by the agency to which such person applied for services, the type of service sought, and the council district in which such person resides.",
