  "Summary": "This bill would require the Department of Veterans’ Services (DVS), in coordination with agencies such as the Mayor’s Community Affairs Unit and the Mayor’s Public Engagement Unit, to conduct outreach and public education regarding the mental health resources and services available to veterans in the city. The bill would require DVS to use, at a minimum, the internet, radio, print media, digital kiosks, subway and other citywide public advertisements, to provide information on such resources and to encourage veterans to contact DVS if in need of further assistance. The bill would also require DVS to include a link on its website that allows community-based organizations to submit information about their mental health services and to be included in DVS’s outreach and public education campaign.",
