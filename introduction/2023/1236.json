  "Summary": "This bill would require that any housing developer on a housing development project, which receives city assistance, pay their workers a minimum combined wage package of at least forty dollars per hour with no less than twenty five dollars of that package being wages. It would also require a best effort that at least forty percent of the hours worked on the project are worked by residents of a zip code where at least 15% of the population is below the federal poverty rate or be residents of a New York City Housing Authority development. This bill would require a public database and annual reporting on the program. The bill would give the comptroller enforcement of these requirements with the ability to levy civil penalties as well as provide for a private right of action for worker are subject to a violation of the bill.",

The type and amount of city financial assistance related to the housing development project awarded to a developer;\n      3. The name and address of each developer that is receiving city financial assistance related to the housing development project;\n      4. The city agency with primary project oversight of the housing development project; and \n      5. A copy of the developer's community hire plan.\n      b. For each housing development project, each developer shall report to the department, and the department shall publish on its website no less than quarterly, the following information:\n      1. the name and address of each construction employer, or any other entity that employs construction workers, on the housing development project;\n      2. the total number of construction workers employed on the construction project;\n      3. the total number of construction work hours worked on the construction project, disaggregated by those hours worked by the categories of workers described in the target population;\n      4. the overall percentage of construction hours worked by the categories of workers described in the target population;\n      5. the percentage of construction hours worked by the categories of workers described in the target population for each construction employer; and\n      6. the total number of hours worked on a construction project, disaggregated by workers' compensation classification code.\n      c.

No later than the day on which work begins at a site subject to the requirements of this chapter, the construction employer shall post in a prominent and accessible place at every such work site and provide each employee a copy of a written notice, prepared by the comptroller, detailing the wages, benefits, and other protections to which employees are entitled under this chapter. Such notice shall also provide the name, address and telephone number of the comptroller and a statement advising employees that if they have been paid less than the combined wage and essential benefits amount they may notify the comptroller and request an investigation. Such notices shall be provided in all of the designated citywide languages. The comptroller shall make publicly available sample written notices explaining the rights of employees and covered employers' obligations under this chapter.\n      b. Each construction employer shall maintain original payroll records for each of its employees reflecting the days and hours worked, and the wages paid and benefits provided for such hours worked, and shall retain such records for no less than six years after the work is performed. Within five days of work on the site, a construction employer shall provide a certified original payroll record in the manner of electronic recording determined by the comptroller. A Failure to maintain or provide such records as required shall create a rebuttable presumption that the covered employer did not pay its employees the wages and benefits required under this section. Upon the request of the comptroller or the city, the covered employer shall provide within five days such documents, subscribed and sworn to or affirmed by him or her as true under the penalties of perjury, as may be deemed necessary to adequately enforce the provisions of this chapter, including, but not limited to, notices required under subdivisions one and two of section one hundred ninety-five of the labor law or copies of the notification of essential benefits required by this chapter. Any person who willfully fails to file such records with the comptroller within the time specified in this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of one thousand dollars per day.\n      c. It shall be unlawful for any construction employer to retaliate, discharge, demote, suspend, take adverse employment action in the terms and conditions of employment or otherwise discriminate against any employee for reporting or asserting a violation of this chapter, for seeking or communicating information regarding rights conferred by this chapter, for exercising any other rights protected under this chapter, or for participating in any investigatory, administrative, or court proceeding relating to this chapter. This protection shall also apply to any employee or his or her representative who in good faith alleges a violation of this chapter. Taking adverse employment action against an employee or his or her representative within sixty days of the employee engaging in any of the aforementioned activities shall raise a rebuttable presumption of having done so in retaliation for those activities. Any employee subjected to any action that violates this paragraph may pursue administrative remedies or bring a civil action as authorized pursuant to this chapter in a court of competent jurisdiction.\n      � 26-3606 Enforcement. a. The comptroller shall monitor compliance with the requirements of this chapter. Whenever the comptroller has reason to believe there has been a violation of this chapter, or upon a complaint in writing from a construction worker or their representative claiming a violation of this chapter, the comptroller shall conduct an investigation to determine the facts relating thereto. In conducting such investigation, the comptroller shall have the same investigatory, hearing, and other powers as are conferred on the comptroller by sections 234 and 235 of the labor law. \n      b. At the start of an investigation conducted pursuant to this section, the comptroller may, in a manner consistent with the withholding procedures established by subdivision 2 of section 235 of the labor law, request that the department or city economic development entity, or any other relevant agency, withhold any payment due to the developer or construction employer in order to safeguard the rights of the employees.\n      c. The comptroller may negotiate an agreed-upon stipulation of settlement or conduct a hearing concerning the alleged violation of this section. At least 10 days before the hearing, the comptroller shall give notice thereof together with a copy of the complaint, or a statement of the facts disclosed upon investigation, which notice shall be served personally or by mail on any person, developer, or construction employer affected thereby, or electronically, where such person, developer, or construction employer has consented. Such person, developer, or construction employer shall have the opportunity to be heard at the hearing regarding such matters. \n      d. Based upon the hearing record, the comptroller shall provide a report and recommendation concerning the alleged violation of this section to the mayor or mayor's designee, who shall issue an order with a final determination. Such order may: \n      1. Direct payment of one and one half times the wages and/or the monetary equivalent of benefits wrongly denied; \n      2. Direct the filing or disclosure of any records that were not filed or made available to the public as required by this chapter; \n      3. Direct the reinstatement of, or other appropriate relief for, any person found to have been subject to retaliation or discrimination in violation of this chapter; \n      4. Direct payment of a further sum as a civil penalty in an amount not exceeding 25 percent of the total amount found to be due in violation of this chapter; \n      5. Direct payment of the sums withheld at the commencement of the investigation and the interest that has accrued thereon to the employer; \n      6. issue a stop work order of construction; and \n      7. Direct rescindment of the financial assistance. \n      e. In assessing an appropriate remedy, due consideration shall be given to the size of the employer's business, the employer's good faith, the gravity of the violation, the history of previous violations and the failure to comply with record-keeping, reporting, anti-retaliation or other non-wage requirements. \n      f. When a final order has been entered against a developer or construction employer in two instances, within any consecutive six year period, determining that such employer has failed to comply with the wage, benefits, anti-retaliation, record-keeping or reporting requirements of this chapter, such employer, and any principal or officer of such employer who knowingly participated in such failure, shall be ineligible to submit a bid on or be awarded any city contract or financial assistance for a period of five years from the date of the second disposition provided, however, that where any such final order involves the falsification of payroll records or the kickback of wages, the employer or any officer of the employer who knowingly participated in the violation of this article shall be ineligible to submit a bid on or be awarded any city contract or financial assistance for a period of five years from the date of the final order. \n      g. When a final disposition has been made finding a violation of this chapter and the person found violating this chapter has failed to comply with the payment or other terms of the remedial order, and provided that no proceeding for judicial review shall then be pending and the time for initiation of such proceeding shall have expired, the mayor, or his or her designee, as applicable shall file a copy of such order containing the amount found to be due with the clerk of the county of residence or place of business of the person found to have violated this section, or of any principal or officer thereof who knowingly participated in the violation of this section. The filing of such order shall have the full force and effect of a judgment duly docketed in the office of such clerk. The order may be enforced by and in the name of the mayor in the same manner and with like effect as that prescribed by the civil practice law and rules for the enforcement of a money judgment. \n      h. Before any further payment is made, or claim is permitted, of any sums or benefits due under any agreement covered by this chapter, it shall be the duty of the city or city economic development entity to require the construction employer to file a written statement certifying to the amounts then due and owing from each such employer to or on behalf of all employees, or the city for wages or benefits wrongly denied them, or for civil penalties assessed, and setting forth the names of the persons owed and the amount due to or on behalf of each respectively. This statement shall be verified as true and accurate by the employer under penalty of perjury. If any interested person shall have previously filed a protest in writing objecting to the payment to any employer on the ground that payment is owing to one or more employees of the employer for violations of this section, or if for any other reason it may be deemed advisable, the City shall deduct from the whole amount of any payment to the employer sums admitted by the employer in the verified statement or statements to be due and owing to any employee before making payment of the amount certified for payment, and may withhold the amount so deducted for the benefit of the employees or persons that are owed payment as shown by the verified statements and may pay directly to any person the amount shown by the statements to be due them. \n      i. The comptroller shall be authorized to contract with non-governmental agencies to investigate possible violations of this chapter. Where a developer or construction employer is found to have violated the requirements of this chapter, the developer or construction employer shall be liable to the city for costs incurred in investigating and prosecuting the violation.\n      � 26-3607 Private Right of Action. a. Any individual who is aggrieved by a violation of this chapter shall have the right to commence an action in a court of competent jurisdiction on their own behalf against the developer or construction employer. \n      b. For each violation of section 26-3602, the construction worker may recover compensatory and punitive damages. If such violation was committed with intent or recklessness, the construction worker may recover treble damages.\n      c. For each violation of section 26-3603, the construction worker may recover double damages in the amount of the difference between actual wages and the combined wage and benefits required by this chapter. If such violation was committed with intent or recklessness, the construction worker may recover treble damages.\n      d. Any person who is a victim of retaliation shall be entitled to all relief necessary to make such person whole, including but not limited to: \n      1. an injunction to restrain any adverse or retaliatory action; \n      2. reinstatement to the position such employee would have had but for such action, or to an equivalent position; and \n      3. reinstatement of full benefits and seniority rights including payment of any missed back pay, plus interest. \n      e. Persons aggrieved by a violation of chapter or by retaliation shall be entitled to compensation for any special damages sustained as a result of an action commenced pursuant to this section, including litigation costs and reasonable attorneys' fees; and to relief other than set forth in this section as the court may deem appropriate.\n      � 26-3608 Liability. a. Developers and construction employers shall assume liability for any debt resulting from an action under this chapter, owed to a wage claimant or third party on the wage claimant's behalf, incurred by a subcontractor at any tier acting under, by or for the construction employer for its subcontractors for the wage claimant's performance of labor.\n      b. No agreement or release by an employee or subcontractor to waive liability assigned to a developer or construction employer under this section shall be valid. The provision of this section shall not be deemed to impair the rights of a developer or construction employer to maintain an action against a subcontractor for amounts for owed wages that are paid by a developer or construction employer pursuant to this section.\n      � 2. This local law takes effect 180 days after it becomes law, provided that this local law shall not apply to any written agreement providing for city financial assistance executed prior to such effective date, except that extension, renewal, amendment or modification of such written agreement, occurring on or after such effective date that results in the grant of any additional city financial assistance shall make such written agreement subject to the requirements of this local law, and provided further that the comptroller and commissioner of housing preservation and development may promulgate any rules necessary for implementation of this local law and take any other measures as are necessary for its implementation, prior to such date.\n\n\nCoJM\nLS #11852\n10/25/2023",
