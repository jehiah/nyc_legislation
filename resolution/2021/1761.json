Prior to the 30-day period, the #transit agency# may request relevant materials from the owner of the #zoning lot#, including existing and proposed site conditions, or other necessary information that will support the planning of such #transit volume#.\n\nAfter the size and general location of the #transit volume# has been determined by the #transit agency#, the owner shall submit for approval by the #transit agency# a site plan showing a proposed specific location of the #transit volume# that would be compatible with the proposed #development# or #enlargement# on the #zoning lot#. The #transit agency# shall, within 30 days of its receipt, either approve the site plan, or request modifications to the #transit volume# within the site plan in a manner that aligns with the concept plan. Upon such request, the owner shall submit a revised site plan, and within 15 days of its receipt, the #transit agency# shall confirm that the requested modifications have been addressed. In the event that such requested modifications have not been sufficiently addressed, subsequent revisions to the site plan may be requested by the #transit agency#, and each submission shall have a 15-day review period from the #transit agency#.\n\nUpon approval of the site plan by the #transit agency#, such site plan shall be certified by the Chairperson of the City Planning Commission pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section prior to the issuance of a building permit by the Department of Buildings for such #development# or #enlargement#.\n\nNotwithstanding the above, a building permit may be issued for a #development# or #enlargement#:\n\n(1)\twhere the size of the proposed #transit volume# exceeds 25 percent of the width of any #street# frontage on the #zoning lot#, as measured along the #street line#; or\n\n(2)\twhere the number of days associated with the determination and review periods by the #transit agency# exceeds any of the limits set forth in this paragraph, or a total review period of 120 days.
