L.U. No. 929), a zoning map amendment to (a) rezone an M3-1 zoning district to a C6-2 zoning district; and (b) rezone an M3-1 zoning district to a M1-4 zoning district; N 220063 ZRK (Pre. L.U. No. 930), a zoning text amendment to establish the project area as a Mandatory Inclusionary Housing (MIH) area; allow an LSGD that does not meet the ownership requirements of Zoning Resolution (ZR) Section 74-742, and allow new piers and in-water structures that are accessible to the public to generate floor area; C 220061 MLK (L.U. No. 932), a landfill action to add approximately 6,320 square feet to create open area as part of the waterfront public space; C 220064 ZSK (L.U. No. 933), a special permit pursuant to ZR Section 74-74 to establish a LSGD, allow reconstructed piers to retain floor area, and modify bulk regulations; C 220070 ZSK (L.U. No. 935), a special permit pursuant to ZR Section 74-533 to reduce the parking requirements for accessory group parking facilities in a Transit Zone; and C 210425 MMK (L.U. No. 936), city map change to eliminate, discontinue, close, and dispose of a segment of Metropolitan Avenue to the west of River Street and a portion of North First Street west of River Street; \n\n      \n      \n      WHEREAS, the Authorization is subject to review and action by the Council pursuant to Section 62-822 of the Zoning Resolution of the City of New York;\n      \n      \tWHEREAS, upon due notice, the Council held a public hearing on the Decision and Application on December 2, 2021;\n\n\tWHEREAS, the City Planning Commission has made the findings required pursuant to Section 62-822(a)(2) of the Zoning Resolution of the City of New York;\n\n      WHEREAS, the Council has considered the land use implications and other policy issues relating to the Authorization and Application; and \n\n      WHEREAS, the Council has considered the relevant environmental issues, including the Positive Declaration issued March 22nd, 2021 (CEQR No. 21DCP157K) and a Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for which a Notice of Completion was issued on November 5, 2021, in which significant adverse impacts related to hazardous materials, air quality, and noise would be avoided through the placement of (E) designations (E-636) on the project sites. To ensure the implementation of the PCREs, the applicant will enter into a Restrictive Declaration at the time of the approval of land use-related actions and prior to issuance of any permits.  The proposed project as analyzed in the FEIS identified significant adverse impacts with respect to transportation (pedestrians, street user safety) and construction (noise) and to ensure the implementation of the mitigation measures identified in the FEIS, they are included in the Restrictive Declaration.\n\nRESOLVED: \n\n\tHaving considered the FEIS with respect to the Decision and Application, the Council finds that:\n \t\n(1) The FEIS meets the requirements of 6 N.Y.C.R.R. Part 617; \n\n(2) Consistent with social, economic and other essential considerations from among the reasonable alternatives available, the action is one which avoids or minimizes adverse environmental impacts to the maximum extent practicable; and \n\n(3) The adverse environmental impacts identified in the FEIS will be minimized or avoided to the maximum extent practicable by incorporating as conditions to the approval, those mitigative measures that were identified as practicable.\n\n\tThe Decision, together with the FEIS constitute the written statement of facts, and of social, economic and other factors and standards that form the basis of this determination, pursuant to 6 N.Y.C.R.R. �617.11(d).\n\n      Pursuant to Sections 62-822(a) and 62-132 of the Zoning Resolution of the City of New York and on the basis of the Authorization and Application, the Council approves the Decision, subject to the following terms and conditions:\n\n1.
