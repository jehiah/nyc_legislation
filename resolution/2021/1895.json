  "Text": "By Council Members Salamanca and Moya\n\n\tWHEREAS, River Street Partners, LLC, filed an application pursuant to Section 201 of the New York City Charter, for an amendment of the text of the Zoning Resolution of the City of New York, modifying Article VII, Chapter 4 (Special Permits by the City Planning Commission) for the purpose of modifying Large-scale General Development provisions, and modifying APPENDIX F, for the purpose of establishing a Mandatory Inclusionary Housing area, which in conjunction with the related actions would facilitate the construction of an approximately 1.16 million-square-foot mixed-use large-scale general development (LSGD) containing approximately 1,050 residential units, 30,000 square feet of community facility uses, 79,000 square feet of commercial space, and 2.9 acres of open space located at 105 River Street in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, Community District 1 (ULURP No. N 220063 ZRK), (the \"Application\");\n\n      WHEREAS, the City Planning Commission filed with the Council on November 17, 2021, its decision dated November 17, 2021 (the \"Decision\") on the Application;\n\n\tWHEREAS, the Application is related to applications C 220062 ZMK (Pre. L.U. No. 929), a zoning map amendment to (a) rezone an M3-1 zoning district to a C6-2 zoning district; and (b) rezone an M3-1 zoning district to a M1-4 zoning district; C 220061 MLK (L.U. No. 932), a landfill action to add approximately 6,320 square feet to create open area as part of the waterfront public space; C 220064 ZSK (L.U. No. 933), a special permit pursuant to ZR Section 74-74 to establish a LSGD, allow reconstructed piers to retain floor area, and modify bulk regulations; N 220065 ZAK (L.U. No. 934), an authorization pursuant to ZR Section 62-822(a) to modify regulations pertaining to the locations and dimensions of required waterfront public access areas; C 220070 ZSK (L.U. No. 935), a special permit pursuant to ZR Section 74-533 to reduce the parking requirements for accessory group parking facilities in a Transit Zone; and C 210425 MMK (L.U. No. 936), city map change to eliminate, discontinue, close, and dispose of a segment of Metropolitan Avenue to the west of River Street and a portion of North First Street west of River Street; \n\n      WHEREAS, the Decision is subject to review and action by the Council pursuant to Section 197-d of the City Charter;\n\n      WHEREAS, upon due notice, the Council held a public hearing on the Decision and Application on November 18, 2021;\n      \n      WHEREAS, the Council has considered the land use implications and other policy issues relating to the Decision and Application; and\n\n      WHEREAS, the Council has considered the relevant environmental issues, including the Positive Declaration issued March 22nd, 2021 (CEQR No. 21DCP157K) and a Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for which a Notice of Completion was issued on November 5, 2021, in which significant adverse impacts related to hazardous materials, air quality, and noise would be avoided through the placement of (E) designations (E-636) on the project sites. To ensure the implementation of the PCREs, the applicant will enter into a Restrictive Declaration at the time of the approval of land use-related actions and prior to issuance of any permits.  The proposed project as analyzed in the FEIS identified significant adverse impacts with respect to transportation (pedestrians, street user safety) and construction (noise) and to ensure the implementation of the mitigation measures identified in the FEIS, they are included in the Restrictive Declaration.  \n\nRESOLVED: \n\n\tHaving considered the FEIS with respect to the Decision and Application, the Council finds that:\n \t\n(1) The FEIS meets the requirements of 6 N.Y.C.R.R. Part 617; \n\n(2) The environmental impacts disclosed in the FEIS were evaluated in relation to the social, economic, and other considerations associated with the action[s] that are set forth in this report; and\n\n(3) Consistent with social, economic and other essential considerations from among the reasonable alternatives available, the action is one which avoids or minimizes adverse environmental impacts to the maximum extent practicable; and \n\n(4) The adverse environmental impacts identified in the FEIS will be minimized or avoided to the maximum extent practicable by incorporating as conditions to the approval, pursuant to the restrictive declaration dated November 15, 2021, those project components related to the environment and mitigation measures that were identified as practicable.\n\n\tThe Decision, together with the FEIS constitute the written statement of facts, and of social, economic and other factors and standards that form the basis of this determination, pursuant to 6 N.Y.C.R.R. �617.11(d).\n\n      Pursuant to Sections 197-d and 200 of the City Charter and on the basis of the Decision and Application, and based on the environmental determination and consideration described in the report, N 220063 ZRK, incorporated by reference herein, and the record before the Council, the Council approves the Decision of the City Planning Commission with the following modifications:\n\nMatter underlined is new, to be added;
