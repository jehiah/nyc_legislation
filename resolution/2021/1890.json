  "Text": "By Council Members Salamanca and Moya\n\n\tWHEREAS, New York City Department of City Planning, filed an application pursuant to Section 201 of the New York City Charter, for an amendment of the Zoning Resolution of the City of New York, establishing the Special SoHo-NoHo Mixed Use District (Article XIV, Chapter 3) and modifying APPENDIX F for the purpose of establishing a Mandatory Inclusionary Housing area, and modifying related Sections, which in conjunction with the related action would facilitate land use changes for a 56-block area to implement the SoHo/NoHo Neighborhood Plan in Manhattan, Community District 2 (Application No. N 210423 ZRM) (the \"Application\");\n\n      WHEREAS, the City Planning Commission filed with the Council on October 22, 2021, its decision dated October 20, 2021 (the \"Decision\"), on the Application;\n\n\tWHEREAS, the Application is related to application C 210422 ZMM (L.U. No. 918), a zoning map amendment to change M1-5A and M1-5B districts to M1-5/R7X, M1-5/R9X, M1-6/R10 districts and establish the Special SoHo-NoHo Mixed Use District; \n      \n      WHEREAS, the Decision is subject to review and action by the Council pursuant to Section 197-d of the City Charter;\n\n      WHEREAS, upon due notice, the Council held a public hearing on the Decision and Application on November 9, 2021;\n\n      WHEREAS, the Council has considered the land use implications and other policy issues relating to the Decision and Application; and\n\n      WHEREAS, the Council has considered the relevant environmental issues, including the Positive Declaration issued October 28, 2020 (CEQR No. 21DCP059M). Significant adverse impacts related to hazardous materials, air quality and noise would be avoided through the placement of (E) designations (E-619) on selected projected and potential development sites as specified in Chapters 10, 15 and 17, respectively of the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS). The FEIS determined that the proposed actions would have identified significant adverse impacts, which along with proposed mitigation measures, are summarized in Chapter 21, \"Mitigation\" of the FEIS. The Council has also considered the Technical Memorandum dated___;\n \nRESOLVED:\n\nHaving considered the FEIS and Technical Memorandum with respect to the Decision and Application, the Council finds that:\n \t\n1. The FEIS meets the requirements of 6 N.Y.C.R.R. Part 617; \n\n2. The environmental impacts disclosed in the FEIS were evaluated in relation to the social, economic, and other considerations associated with the actions that are set forth in this report; and\n\n3. Consistent with social, economic, and other essential considerations from among the reasonable alternatives available, the action is one which avoids or minimizes adverse environmental impacts to the maximum extent practicable; and\n\t\nThe Decision, together with the FEIS and Technical Memorandum constitute the written statement of facts, and of social, economic and other factors and standards that form the basis of this determination, pursuant to 6 N.Y.C.R.R. ÔøΩ617.11(d).\n\n      Pursuant to Sections 197-d and 200 of the City Charter and on the basis of the Decision and Application, and based on the environmental determination and consideration described in the report, N 210423 ZRM, incorporated by reference herein, and the record before the Council, the Council approves the Decision of the City Planning Commission with the following modifications:\n\nMatter underlined is new, to be added;\nMatter struck out is to be deleted;\nMatter within # # is defined in Section 12-10;\n* * * indicates where unchanged text appears in the Zoning Resolution.\nMatter double struck out is old, deleted by the City Council;\nMatter double-underlined is new, added by the City Council\n\nARTICLE I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nChapter 1\nTitle, Establishment of Controls and Interpretation of Regulations\n*\t*\t*\n11-10\nESTABLISHMENT AND SCOPE OF CONTROLS, ESTABLISHMENT OF DISTRICTS AND INCORPORATION OF MAPS\n*\t*\t*\n11-12\nEstablishment of Districts\n*\t*\t*\n11-122\nDistricts established\nIn order to carry out the purposes and provisions of this Resolution, the following districts are hereby established:\n\n*\t*\t*\n\nSpecial Purpose Districts\n*\t*\t*\n\nEstablishment of the Special Sheepshead Bay District \n\nIn order to carry out the special purposes of this Resolution as set forth in Article IX, Chapter 4, the #Special Sheepshead Bay District# is hereby established.\n\n\nEstablishment of the Special SoHo-NoHo Mixed Use District\n\nIn order to carry out the special purposes of this Resolution as set forth in Article XIV, Chapter 3, the #Special SoHo-NoHo Mixed Use District# is hereby established.\n\n\nEstablishment of the Special South Richmond Development District\n\nIn order to carry out the special purposes of this Resolution as set forth in Article X, Chapter 7, the #Special South Richmond Development District# is hereby established.\n\n*\t*\t*\n\nChapter 2\nConstruction of Language and Definitions\n*\t*\t*\n12-10 \nDEFINITIONS\n*\t*\t*\nAccessory use, or accessory \nAn \"accessory use\"\n*\t*\t*\n(2) \tLiving or sleeping accommodations for caretakers in connection with any #use# listed in Use Groups 3 through 18 inclusive, provided that:\n*\t*\t*\n(iv)\t in C6-2M, C6-4M, M1-5M, M1-6M, M1-5A and M1-5B Districts, no living or sleeping accommodation for caretakers is permitted in any #building# which contains a #residential use# or a #joint living-work quarters for artists#; and\n*\t*\t*\nJoint living-work quarters for artists \nA \"joint living-work quarters for artists\" consists of one or more #rooms# in a #non-residential building#, on one or more floors, with lawful cooking space and sanitary facilities meeting the requirements of the Housing Maintenance Code, occupied:\n(a)\tand arranged and designed for use by, and is used by, not more than four non-related #artists#, or an #artist# and the #artist's# household, and including adequate working space reserved for the #artist#, or #artists# residing therein;\n(b)\tby any household residing therein on September 15, 1986 whose members are all unable to meet the #artist# certification qualifications of the Department of Cultural Affairs that registers with the Department of Cultural Affairs prior to nine months from January 8, 1987; or\n(c)\tby any person who is entitled to occupancy by any other provision of law.\nRegulations governing #joint living-work quarters for artists# are set forth in Article I, Chapter 5, Sections 42-14, paragraph D.
