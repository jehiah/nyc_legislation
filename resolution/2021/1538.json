Bailey and Assembly Member Catalina Cruz, would remove the Police Commissioner's discretion to modify or reject a determination or recommendation made by the CCRB; and\n      Whereas, In addition, S5252/A6012 would provide due process and a fair and impartial determination of civilian complaints by a hearing officer who is independent of the Police Department; and\n      Whereas, Removing the Police Commissioner's exclusive authority over police discipline and allowing the CCRB to impose discipline in certain cases would increase accountability and public trust in the NYPD; now, therefore, be it \n\tResolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S5252/A6012, which would remove the New York City Police Commissioner's exclusive authority over police discipline. \n\nLS # 9759\n3/22/21 8:35PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2",
