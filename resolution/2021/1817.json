No. 864), a zoning map amendment to change an R8B District to a C2-7 District and to change a C1-9 District to a C2-8 District; and N 210352 ZRM (L.U. No. 865), a zoning text amendment to allow scientific research and development facilities in C2-7 Districts and allow related use and bulk modifications, and to designate a Mandatory Inclusionary Housing (MIH) area; \n       \n      WHEREAS, the Decision is subject to review and action by the Council pursuant to Section 197-d of the City Charter;\n\n      WHEREAS, the City Planning Commission has made the findings required pursuant to Section 74-48 of the Zoning Resolution of the City of New York;\n\n      WHEREAS, upon due notice, the Council held a public hearing on the Decision and Application on October 20, 2021;\n\n      WHEREAS, the Council has considered the land use and environmental implications and other policy issues relating to the Decision and Application; and\n\n\tWHEREAS, the Council has considered the relevant environmental issues, including the Positive Declaration issued November 13th, 2020 (CEQR No. 21DCP080M) and a Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for which a Notice of Completion was issued on September 10, 2021, in which significant adverse impacts related to hazardous materials, air quality, and noise would be avoided through the placement of (E) designations (E-612) on the project sites.  To ensure the implementation of the PCREs the applicant will enter into a Restrictive Declaration at the time of the approval of land use-related actions and prior to issuance of any permits.  The proposed project as analyzed in the FEIS identified significant adverse impacts with respect to shadows and construction (noise) and to ensure the implementation of the mitigation measures identified in the FEIS, they are included in the Restrictive Declaration. The Council has also considered the Technical Memorandum dated November 16, 2021 (the \"Technical Memorandum\").\n      \nRESOLVED:\n\tHaving considered the FEIS and Technical Memorandum with respect to the Decision and Application, the Council finds that:\n \t\n1) The FEIS meets the requirements of 6 N.Y.C.R.R.
