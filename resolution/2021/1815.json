  "Text": "By Council Members Salamanca and Moya\n\n\tWHEREAS, New York Blood Center, Inc., filed an application pursuant to Sections 197-c and 201 of the New York City Charter for an amendment of the Zoning Map, Section No. 8c, by changing from an R8B District to a C2-7 District and changing from a C1-9 District to a C2-8 District, which in conjunction with the related action would facilitate the development of a new, modern headquarters for the New York Blood Center and a commercial life sciences hub located at 310 East 67th Street (Block 1441, Lot 40) in the Upper East Side of Manhattan, Community District 8 (ULURP No. C 210351 ZMM) (the \"Application\");\n      \n      WHEREAS, the City Planning Commission filed with the Council on September 27, 2021 its decision dated September 22, 2021 (the \"Decision\") on the Application;\n\n      WHEREAS, the Application is related to application N 210352 ZRM (L.U. No. 865), a zoning text amendment to allow scientific research and development facilities in C2-7 Districts and allow related use and bulk modifications, and to designate a Mandatory Inclusionary Housing (MIH) area; and C 210353 ZSM (L.U. No. 866), a zoning special permit pursuant to Section 74-48 of the Zoning Resolution to allow a scientific research and development facility and to allow modification of the height and setback regulations of Section 33-432;\n\n      WHEREAS, the Decision is subject to review and action by the Council pursuant to Section 197-d of the City Charter;\n\n      WHEREAS, upon due notice, the Council held a public hearing on the Decision and Application on October 20, 2021;\n      \n      WHEREAS, the Council has considered the land use and other policy issues relating to the Decision and Application; and\n\n\tWHEREAS, the Council has considered the relevant environmental issues, including the Positive Declaration issued November 13th, 2020 (CEQR No. 21DCP080M) and a Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for which a Notice of Completion was issued on September 10, 2021, in which significant adverse impacts related to hazardous materials, air quality, and noise would be avoided through the placement of (E) designations (E-612) on the project sites.  To ensure the implementation of the PCREs the applicant will enter into a Restrictive Declaration at the time of the approval of land use-related actions and prior to issuance of any permits.  The proposed project as analyzed in the FEIS identified significant adverse impacts with respect to shadows and construction (noise) and to ensure the implementation of the mitigation measures identified in the FEIS, they are included in the Restrictive Declaration. The Council has also considered the Technical Memorandum dated November 16, 2021 (the \"Technical Memorandum\").\n      \n      \nRESOLVED:\n\n\tHaving considered the FEIS and Technical Memorandum with respect to the Decision and Application, the Council finds that:\n \t\n1) The FEIS meets the requirements of 6 N.Y.C.R.R.
