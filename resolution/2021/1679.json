At such time, HPD may unsecure or forgive all or a portion of the Land Debt, and unsecure, but not forgive, all or a portion of the City Subsidy, based on the appraised value of a homeownership unit and/or, in the case of forgiveness of Land Debt, if HPD determines that the forgiveness is necessary to reduce the taxable consideration for a unit.

At such time, HPD may unsecure or forgive all or a portion of the Land Debt, and unsecure, but not forgive, all or a portion of the City Subsidy, based on the appraised value of a homeownership unit and/or, in the case of forgiveness of Land Debt, if HPD determines that the forgiveness is necessary to reduce the taxable consideration for a unit.
