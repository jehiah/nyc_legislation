Council Members' Operating Expenses - The amounts allocated in the Council budget for the operation of individual members' offices shall be the same for each member.  The Speaker may not reduce such amount for any member unless all members are subject to the same reduction.  The Speaker may not supplement the amount available to any member through direct or indirect payment, provided that the Speaker may, with notice to all members, supplement the amount available to an individual Councilmember in cases of special need.  It is the intent of the body that the total amount allocated for the operation of individual members' offices shall be reasonable in proportion to the amount allocated for central staff.\n      \n      b.  No city funds appropriated to the Council shall be used by the Speaker, a Council Member or Council central staff for expenses related to travel, lodging or meals outside the confines of the City of New York, unless such travel shall have been approved in advance by the Conflicts of Interest Board.
