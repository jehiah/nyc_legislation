The impacts to historic and cultural resources would be mitigated to the maximum extent practicable through additional analyses, archaeological monitoring, or an alternative method developed in consultation with the New York State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) and the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC).
