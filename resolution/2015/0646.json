For the purposes hereof, the following terms shall have the following meanings:\n(a)\t\"Company\" shall mean CE Hunts Point LLC.\n\n(b)\t\"Effective Date\" shall mean the later of (i) the date of conveyance of the Exemption Area to the HDFC, or (ii) the date that HPD and the Owner enter into the Regulatory Agreement.\n\n(c)\t\"Exemption\" shall mean the exemption from real property taxation provided hereunder.\n\n(d)\t\"Exemption Area\" shall mean the real property located in the Borough of Bronx, City and State of New York, identified as Block 2685, Lot 28, Block 2740, Lots 10 and 12, and Block 2762, Lots 16, 18, 25 and 40, on the Tax Map of the City of New York.\n\n(e)\t\"Expiration Date\" shall mean the earlier to occur of (i) a date which is twenty-eight (28) years from the Effective Date, (ii) the date of expiration or termination of the Regulatory Agreement or (iii) the date upon which the Exemption Area ceases to be owned by either a housing development fund company or an entity wholly controlled by a housing development fund company.\n\n      (f)\t\"HDFC\" shall mean CEHP Housing Development Fund Company, Inc.\n\n(g)\t\"HPD\" shall mean the City of New York Department of Housing Preservation and Development.\n\n(h)\t\"J-51 Benefits\" shall mean any tax benefits pursuant to Section 489 of the Real Property Tax Law for the Exemption Area which are in effect on the Effective Date.\n\n      (i)\t\"Owner\" shall mean, collectively, the HDFC and the Company.\n\n(j)\t\"Regulatory Agreement\" shall mean the regulatory agreement between HPD and the Owner establishing certain controls upon the operation of the Exemption Area during the term of the Exemption.\n\n(k)\t\"Shelter Rent\" shall mean the total rents received from the commercial and residential occupants of the Exemption Area, including any federal subsidy (including, but not limited to, Section 8, rent supplements, and rental assistance), less the cost of providing to such occupants electricity, gas, heat and other utilities.\n\n      (l)\t\"Shelter Rent Tax\" shall mean an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of Shelter Rent.\n\n2.\tAll of the value of the property in the Exemption Area, including both the land and any improvements (excluding those portions, if any, devoted to business or commercial use), shall be exempt from real property taxation, other than assessments for local improvements, for a period commencing upon the Effective Date and terminating upon the Expiration Date.\n\n3.\tCommencing upon the Effective Date, and during each year thereafter until the Expiration Date, the Owner shall make real property tax payments in the sum of the Shelter Rent Tax.
