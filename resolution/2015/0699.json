If the noncompliance specified in such notice is not cured within the time period specified therein, the Exemption shall prospectively terminate.\n\nb.\tThe Exemption shall apply to all land in the Exemption Area, but shall only apply to a building on the Exemption Area that exists on the Effective Date.\n\nc.\tNothing herein shall entitle the HDFC to a refund of any real property taxes which accrued and were paid with respect to the Exemption Area prior to the Effective Date.\n\n5.\tIn consideration of the Exemption, the owner of the Exemption Area, for so long as the Exemption shall remain in effect, shall waive the benefits of any additional or concurrent exemption from or abatement of real property taxation which may be authorized under any existing or future local, state or federal law, rule or regulation.
