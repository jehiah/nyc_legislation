and \n\n(3) that such waiver or reduction of parking spaces will result in a better site plan with better quality open areas. \n\nIn determining the amount of parking spaces to waive or reduce, the Commission may take into account current automobile ownership patterns for an existing #non-profit residence for the elderly# on the #zoning lot#, as applicable. \n\nThe City Planning Commission may prescribe additional conditions and safeguards to minimize adverse effects on the surrounding area.\n\nAdopted.\n      Office of the City Clerk, }\n      \tThe City of New York,  } ss.:\n\n      \tI hereby certify that the foregoing is a true copy of a Resolution passed by The Council of The City of New York on August 13, 2015, on file in this office.\n\n\n\n     \t       \t       \t       \t    \t\t\t.................................................... \n      \t       \t       \t       \t     \t\t\tCity Clerk, Clerk of The Council\nPage 2 of 2\nN 150287 ZRX\nRes.
