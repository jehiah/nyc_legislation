  "Text": "By Council Members Mendez, The Speaker (Council Member Mark-Viverito), Rodriguez, Chin and Wills \n\n      Whereas, Oscar L�pez Rivera was born in Puerto Rico in 1943; and\n      Whereas, Oscar L�pez Rivera moved with his family to Chicago as an adolescent; and\n      Whereas, Oscar L�pez Rivera is a decorated Vietnam War veteran; and\n      Whereas, During his tour of service in Vietnam, L�pez Rivera's unit was securing the perimeter of a town to ensure its safety during an election when  the unit unwittingly entered a mine field where many of his fellow soldiers began to sustain serious injuries; and\n      Whereas, Instead of running for cover, L�pez Rivera tended to the wounded and cleared a space for helicopters to land to evacuate them; and \n      Whereas, On that day, L�pez Rivera refused to leave his friends behind, and for this act of valor he was awarded the Bronze Star; and \n      Whereas, It is this dedication to community, friends and family that would become a hallmark of L�pez Rivera's life;\n      Whereas, When L�pez Rivera returned home from the war he found his community wracked by drugs, poverty, substandard housing and blight; and \n      Whereas, Once again, L�pez Rivera refused to run and instead became an activist, fighting to improve conditions for his family, his Puerto Rican community, and the Latino community of Chicago; and\n      Whereas, As a community activist, L�pez Rivera helped found La Escuelita Puertorrique�a, now known as the Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos High School and the Juan Antonio Corretjer Puerto Rican Cultural Center. He became a community organizer for the Northwest Community Organization, ASPIRA, ASSPA, and the 1st Congregational Church of Chicago. He helped to found FREE, a half-way house for convicted drug addicts, and ALAS, an educational program for Latino prisoners at Stateville Prison in Illinois. L�pez Rivera also worked to establish bilingual education in public schools and pressured universities to recruit Latino students and faculty. Perhaps most significantly, L�pez Rivera struggled to end discrimination against minority communities; and\n      Whereas, L�pez Rivera also fervently believed in Puerto Rican independence, and was critical of the U.S. government's role in the governance of Puerto Rico; and \n      Whereas, Between 1981 and 1983 L�pez Rivera and 13 other men and women involved in the movement for Puerto Rican independence were convicted of seditious conspiracy; and  \n      Whereas, In 1981, L�pez Rivera was sentenced to 55 years in prison; and\n      Whereas, L�pez Rivera has consistently maintained that he was not involved in any acts that harmed anyone or took a life; and\n      Whereas, L�pez Rivera's sentence was greatly disproportionate to the offense for which he was convicted; and \n      Whereas, In 1988, L�pez Rivera was convicted of conspiracy to escape prison and sentenced to an additional 15 years in prison to be served consecutively to his original sentence; and\n      Whereas, This sentence was also greatly disproportionate to the offense for which L�pez Rivera was convicted; and\n      Whereas, In addition, L�pez Rivera was made to serve over 12 years of this sentence in  solitary confinement, meaning he was confined to a  closet-sized cell for 23 hours a day with no human contact; and\n      Whereas, In 1999, President Bill Clinton, offered to commute L�pez Rivera's sentence as well as the sentences of all but two of his co-defendants; and\n      Whereas, In explaining his decision to offer clemency, President Clinton noted that L�pez Rivera was never convicted of specific crimes that resulted in deaths or injuries nor was he ever convicted of any act of violence; and\n      Whereas, President Clinton also noted that \"our society believes that a punishment should fit the crime;\" and\n      Whereas, President Clinton concluded that the sentences received by L�pez Rivera and his co-defendants were \"out of proportion to their crimes\"; and\n      Whereas, Once again, L�pez Rivera refused to leave any member of his community behind and therefore declined the President's offer of clemency; and\n      Whereas, Had L�pez Rivera accepted President Clinton's clemency offer, he would have been released from prison in 2009; and      \n      Whereas, Oscar L�pez Rivera has now served over 33 years in prison; and\n      Whereas, L�pez Rivera has served more time in prison than Nelson Mandela; and \n      Whereas, Many prominent politicians and world leaders including Coretta Scott King, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, former President Jimmy Carter, many Nobel Peace Prize Laureates and others have called for L�pez Rivera to be released from prison; and\n      Whereas, The movement to release L�pez Rivera has become a unifying force, bringing together people of widely diverse backgrounds and political and social beliefs; and \n      Whereas, In 2013, Archbishop Desmond Tutu said of L�pez Rivera's continued imprisonment, \"In any case or interpretation, justice cannot be served by keeping Oscar L�pez Rivera in prison. Now is the time for his immediate and unconditional release;\" and\n      Whereas, The United Nations Decolonization Committee has passed a resolution every year since 2001 calling for L�pez Rivera's release; and   \n      Whereas, The Congressional Hispanic Caucus recently sent a letter to President Obama urging him to commute L�pez Rivera's sentence and \"grant his immediate release from prison\"; and\n      Whereas, In 2013, Alejandro Garc�a Padilla, Governor of Puerto Rico, called on President Obama to commute L�pez Rivera's prison sentence saying, \"We see Mr. L�pez Rivera's release as an issue that must rise above partisan affiliations and status preferences. It is an issue that touches basic issues of humanity, justice and compassion. It is an issue that relates to principles that you certainly share with us. Thirty-two years in prison for Mr. L�pez Rivera is just enough. I ask - Mr. President - that you exercise your constitutional power of pardon to commute his sentence and grant his release;\" and\n      Whereas, Religious leaders including Metropolitan Archbishop of San Juan, Puerto Rico, Roberto Gonz�lez Nieves,  and Reverend Geoffrey A. Black, General Minister and President, United Church of Christ have called for L�pez Rivera's release; and\n      Whereas, National labor organizations including the AFL-CIO, AFSCME and SEIU have called for L�pez Rivera to be released; and  \n      Whereas, Supporters have sent tens of thousands of letters to the President calling for L�pez Rivera's immediate release from prison; and \n      Whereas, New York City is the home of the largest Puerto Rican community outside of Puerto Rico; and\n      Whereas, There is overwhelming support in New York City's Puerto Rican community for L�pez Rivera's immediate release; and\n      Whereas, In January of this year, L�pez Rivera celebrated his 72 nd birthday; and\n      Whereas, L�pez Rivera's official release date is in 2023, when he will be 80 years old; and\n      Whereas, All of the other men and women sent to prison along with L�pez Rivera have since been released and are leading productive and responsible lives; and \n      Whereas, L�pez Rivera is a dedicated father, grandfather, friend, decorated war veteran and community activist; and\n      Whereas, Despite the length of time he has spent in prison and the over 12 years he spent in isolation, L�pez Rivera has not lost his spirit or his profound humanity; and\n      Whereas, It is time for L�pez Rivera to be set free; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council calls upon President Obama to grant clemency to Oscar L�pez Rivera so that he is immediately released from prison, as his continued incarceration is unjust and serves no legitimate purpose. \n\n\n\t\n\n1",
