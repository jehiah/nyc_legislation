In consideration of the New  Exemption, prior or simultaneous with repayment or refinancing of the HUD Mortgage, the Owner, for itself, its successors and assigns, shall (i) execute and record a Use Agreement, (ii) execute and record a Regulatory Agreement, and (iii) waive, for so long as the New Exemption shall remain in effect, the benefits of any additional or concurrent exemption from or abatement of real property taxation which may be authorized under any existing or future local, state or federal law, rule or regulation.\n\nOffice of the City Clerk,     }\t\t\t\nThe City of New York        } ss.:\n\nI hereby certify that the foregoing is a true copy of a Resolution passed by The Council of the City of New York on October 29, 2015, on file in this office.\n                                          \n                                          _______________________\n                                          City Clerk, Clerk of Council",
