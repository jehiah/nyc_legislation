Such vertical elevation may increase any existing #non-compliances# with respect to required #open space# and #yard# regulations to the extent that such #non-compliance# results from the elevation of the lowest floor to the #flood-resistant construction elevation#. All other provisions of Article V, Chapter 4 (Non-complying Buildings), shall apply without modification.\n\nThe level of the adjoining grade shall be the average elevation of the grade adjoining the building, before it is elevated, determined in the manner prescribed by the Building Code of the City of New York for adjoining grade elevation.\n\n\n\n64-A23\nSpecial Regulations for Existing Buildings Located Over Water\n\nFor a #building# that will be vertically elevated and is located either partially or entirely seaward of the #shoreline#, such #building# may be relocated landward of the #shoreline# on the same #zoning lot#.
