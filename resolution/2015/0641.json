  "Text": "Resolved, By the Council of the City of New York, pursuant to the provisions of section 243 of the New York City Charter, that the following amounts shall be submitted to the Mayor, for inclusion in the executive budget for the operating budget for the Council of the City of New York.\n           \nSummary:\n      \n      Under the City Charter, the City Council is authorized to structure its own budget.  This budget must be presented to the Mayor, for inclusion in the Executive Budget, after the Council approves it.\n      The Council's staff is described through divisions within three units of appropriation: Council Members and their aides, Committee Staffing, and Council Services.  These and the standing committees each have a U/A for PS.  OTPS is divided into two categories, one for members, one for central staff (see Appendix A) and one for each standing committee.   A separate resolution approving the central staff's lump sum unit of appropriation is attached for Council approval pursuant to Section 100 (c) of the Charter.  \n\tCouncil Member office budgets are funded in U/A 001 object 021 (PS) and U/A 100 objects 400 and 414 (OTPS).  Funds allocated for Member's budget total $384,000.\n      A new division created by this budget called \"Drafting Division\" provides a unit of staff who specialize in the drafting of legislation proposed by the Council Members which can be eventually offered for introduction to the full Council for consideration. The division will also work with the staff of Governmental Affairs, Human Services and Infrastructure divisions.\n      Staff from the Office of the General Counsel, Governmental Affairs, Finance, Land Use, Infrastructure, Human Services, and Policy & Investigations divisions are specifically assigned to each committee, subcommittee, select committee and task force.  These analysts and attorneys in turn are supported by the Administrative Services Division, which functions as the central administration.  (Please refer to the statements of programmatic objectives).\n      \n      Staff from the following Divisions are assigned to these Committees, Subcommittees and Select Committees:\n\n\nGeneral Counsel\nRules, Privileges and Elections\nStandards & Ethics\nState & Federal Legislation\n\nGovernmental Affairs\nCivil Rights\nConsumer Affairs\nContracts\nCourts and Legal Services\nFire & Criminal Justice Services\nGeneral Welfare\nGovernmental Operations\nImmigration\nJuvenile Justice\nOversight & Investigation\nPublic Safety\n\nFinance\n\nFinance\n\nHuman Services\nAging\nSenior Centers (Subcommittee)\nCivil Services and Labor\nCultural Affairs, Libraries &                       International Intergroup Relations\nLibraries (SubCommittee)\nEducation\nNon-Public Schools (Subcommittee)\nHealth\nHigher Education\nMental Health, Developmental Disability, Alcoholism, Substance Abuse & Disability Services\nSmall Business\nTransportation\nVeterans\nWomen's Issues\nYouth Services\n\n\n\nInfrastructure\nCommunity Development \nEconomic Development\nEnvironmental Protection\nHousing & Buildings\nParks & Recreation\nPublic Housing\nRecovery and Resiliency \nSanitation & Waste Management\nTechnology \nWaterfronts\n\nLand Use\nLand Use\nLandmarks, Public Siting & Maritime Uses (Subcommittee)\nPlanning, Dispositions & Concessions (Subcommittee)\nZoning & Franchises (Subcommittee)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCITY COUNCIL BUDGET\n\nFunction: \n      The New York City Council is the legislative branch of city government.  Council members are elected every four years and each represents a district of approximately 160,000 people.  \n\n      The Council is an equal partner with the Mayor in the governing of New York City.  The Council monitors the operation and performance of city agencies. It has sole responsibility for analyzing and approving the city's budget which sets spending priorities and has decision-making powers over major land use issues.  It is the city's lawmaking body.\n\n      The allocation of funds made through this Resolution are based on current projections and information available. Final allocations may vary from those anticipated in this Resolution, subject to the discretion of the Speaker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n600\tCommittee on the Aging - Responsible for considering and proposing to the full Council legislation and resolutions for adoption, preparing committee reports and conducting legislative oversight on matters in relation to the Department for the Aging and all federal, state and municipal programs pertinent to senior citizens.
