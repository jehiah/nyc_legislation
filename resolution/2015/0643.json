That the Board of Estimate, pursuant to subdivision 1 (a) of Section 422 of the RPTL and Section 577 of Article XI of the PHFL, does hereby approve an exemption from local and municipal taxes, other than assessments for local improvements, of all of the value of the property included in the Housing Project (excluding those portions, if any, devoted to business or commercial use), provided that the Housing Company make annual real estate tax payments commencing upon the Effective Date as hereinafter defined.

In any year in which a real estate tax payment must be made by the Housing Company, the total annual real estate tax payment in such year shall not exceed the lesser of either seventeen (17%) percent of contract rents, or the amount of real estate taxes that would otherwise be due in the absence of any form of tax exemption or abatement provided for by existing or future local law or state legislation for such year.\n\n10. \tThat the required partial real estate tax payment shall first become payable and effective upon the date of issuance ( \"Effective Date') of the Certificate of Occupancy, temporary or permanent, whichever occurs first, for the Housing Project, or, if the Housing Project is constructed in stages, the required partial  real estate tax payment applicable to each stage shall become payable and effective from the date of issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy, temporary or permanent, whichever first occurs, for each such stage.  Furthermore, (i) the tax exemption approved herein shall operate and continue for so long as the HUD mortgage is outstanding, but in no event for a period of more than forty (40) years, commencing upon the Effective Date (\"Expiration Date\") and (ii) nothing herein shall entitle the Housing Company to a refund of any real property taxes which accrued and were paid with respect to the Housing Project prior to January 1, 2016.\n\n \t\tExcept as specifically amended above, all other terms, conditions, provisions and requirements of the Prior Resolution remain in full force and effect.\n \n\nOffice of the City Clerk,     }\t\t\t\nThe City of New York        } ss.:\n\nI hereby certify that the foregoing is a true copy of a Resolution passed by The Council of the City of New York on March 31, 2015, on file in this office.\n                                          \n                                          \n                                          _______________________\n                                          City Clerk, Clerk of Council",
