  "Text": "By Council Members Miller, Mendez and Rose \n\tWhereas, Every day millions of people rely on New York's public transportation system, a system that is essential to the continued growth and vibrancy of the City and the entire metropolitan region; and\n\tWhereas, Recognizing the immense importance of a safe, reliable, and efficient public transportation system, over time New York State has implemented a series of taxes dedicated to funding mass transit; and\n\tWhereas, In addition to fares and tolls, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (\"MTA\") relies on these dedicated revenue streams to provide subway and bus service throughout the City; and\n\tWhereas, During challenging economic times, State government has a history of diverting funds raised through taxes dedicated to the MTA to other areas of the State budget, including the diversion of more than $260 million between 2009 and 2013; and\n\tWhereas, In 2013, the State Legislature unanimously passed, but the Governor vetoed, A.5084, introduced by Assembly Member James F. Brennan, and companion bill S.3837, introduced by State Senator Martin J. Golden, known as the transit lockbox bill, which would have prevented the diversion of dedicated transit funds except by legislation and would have required the State to specifically disclose any such diversion, including specifically disclosing the expected impact of the diversion on mass transit services; and\n\tWhereas, In light of the importance of sustained, reliable funding streams to maintaining the City's essential public transportation system, similar legislation should be reintroduced and enacted; now, therefore, be it\n\tResolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, legislation preventing the diversion of funds raised to support the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.\nLS# 5812\n8/6/2015\nJM",
