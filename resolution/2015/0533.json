Gillibrand and Charles Schumer will be reintroducing legislation, which would reauthorize the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act (the \"Zadroga Act\"); and \n      Whereas, Unless Congress acts to reauthorize the Zadroga Act thousands of injured and ill 9/11 responders and survivors are at risk of losing crucial health care; now, therefore, be it\n\tResolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the United States Congress to pass, and the President to sign the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Reauthorization Act.\nLS# 2703, 2706, 2875\nMarch 30, 2015\nGZ",
