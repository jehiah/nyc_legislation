Du Bois became the editor of the magazine The Crisis in 1910 in New York City, aimed at exposing the widespread prejudice against persons of color, and which became a major publication critiquing segregation and advocating for civil rights, women's rights and labor rights; and\n\tWhereas, New York City native and famed artist of Haitian descent, Jean-Michel Basquiat was a leader of the neo-expressionist movement in New York City, working with other major artists including Andy Warhol, with major exhibits at the Whitney Museum of American Art; and\n      Whereas, Brooklyn born architects of Haitian descent,  Nicole Hollant-Denis and Rodney Leon, have designed several buildings in New York City, including significant sites such as the African Burial Ground Memorial in lower Manhattan and Leon's \"Arc of Return,\" a permanent memorial at the United Nations dedicated to the victims of slavery and the Transatlantic Slave Trade; and\n\tWhereas, According to the 2009 United States Census, there are over 140,000 persons of Haitian descent living in the City of New York today; now, therefore, be it \n\tResolved, That the Council of the City of New York establishes October 9th annually as New York City Haitian Day, in recognition of the historic contributions of Haitians to the City of New York.\nRM/ACK\nLS#4692\n5/11/2016",
