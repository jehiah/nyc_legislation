  "Text": "By Council Members King and Chin \n      \n      Whereas, Blood-forming stem cell transplants are used to restore the stem cells when the bone marrow has been destroyed by disease, chemotherapy, or radiation; and \n      Whereas, Blood-forming cells can come from bone marrow, peripheral (circulating) blood, and the blood in the umbilical cord and placenta after a baby's birth; and\n      Whereas, These transplants are potentially life-saving treatments for people with leukemia, lymphoma or a genetic metabolic or immune system disorder; and \n      Whereas, According to the United States (U.S.) Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), each year more than 20,000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with life-threatening illnesses where bone marrow or umbilical cord blood transplantation from a donor is their best treatment option; and \n      Whereas, Only 30 percent of patients will have a relative who matches and is able to participate in a transplant and the other 70 percent must rely on donors; and\n      Whereas, The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society (LLS) estimated that 156,420 people were diagnosed with leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma in 2014, nearly 10 percent of all cancer diagnoses; and \n      Whereas, Every ten minutes a person dies of blood cancer, and it is estimated that leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma accounted for over 55,000 deaths in the United States in 2014, according to LLS; and\n      Whereas, According to HHS, there are more than 24.5 million potential marrow donors and 622,000 cord blood units available worldwide, however, it is more difficult for patients of racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds to find a match; and\n      Whereas, This was true for Jaden Hilton, as he lost his battle with leukemia at the age of three; and\n      Whereas, Jaden was unable to find a bone marrow match, none of his family members were suitable matches and there was not an adequate match on the National Marrow Donor Program registry; and\n      Whereas, Be the Match reports that the likelihood of finding a match is 66 percent for African American or Black patients and 72 percent for Latino or Hispanic patients versus 93 percent for White patients; and \n      Whereas, To increase the number of minority donors and raise awareness about the importance of bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cell donation, New York State Assembly Member Keith Wright and Senator Diane J. Savino sponsored Jaden's Law (A.4171-B/S.5917); and\n      Whereas, Jaden's Law would require the Commissioner of the New York State Department of Health (DOH) to prepare a brochure for physicians to share with their patients; and\n      Whereas, The brochure would inform patients about their option to become a bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell donor, as well as provide other important information about the procedure and the benefits of donation; and\n      Whereas, The legislation would also require DOH to establish a Bone Marrow and Peripheral Blood Stem Cell (PBSC) Donation Registry; and\n      Whereas, The registry would accept registration by potential donors through mail and online applications and the legislation requires the creation of an outreach and marketing plan for the registry; and\n      Whereas, The bill seeks to make enrolling in the PBSC Donation Registry easy by including this option on both voter registration cards and driver license applications; and\n      Whereas, A version of Jaden's Law has already been enacted in New Jersey; and\n      Whereas, These efforts would increase awareness about the need for bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cell donors and encourage countless individuals to register; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the New York State Legislature to pass and the Governor to sign Jaden's Law, which would provide for the creation a bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cell donation registry, as well as education and outreach to potential donors.\n      \nCP\nLS 5608\n6/19/15",
