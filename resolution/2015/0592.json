State of New York was a landmark case in which the court established the State's constitutional obligation to provide essential resources to all public school children; and\n      Whereas, In order to comply with Court of Appeals CFE ruling, the State Education Budget and Reform Act of 2007 (Education Act) was enacted; and\n      Whereas, The Education Act provided for an increase of over $7 billion in State education aid to be phased-in over four years, by 2011, and the majority, $5.5 billion, to be allocated to school districts based on student need through a new Foundation Formula; and \n      Whereas, The State's funding increase for New York City was set at $3.2 billion; and \n      Whereas, In the first two years, the State provided the required installments of the Foundation Aid Formula totaling $2.3 billion statewide; and  \n      Whereas, However, due to an economic downturn, the State budget enacted for 2009-10 froze the CFE funding increase for two years; and  \n      Whereas, Further, State education aid was cut by a total of $2.7 billion in 2010 and 2011 through a mechanism called the Gap Elimination Adjustment, which seeks to balance the State's overall budget by reducing state school aid; and  \n      Whereas, Despite modest increases in State education funding in the past 3 years, the increases have barely covered prior cuts, leaving a huge gap in terms of what was required under the 2007 Education Act to comply with the CFE ruling; and\n      Whereas, According to an August 2014 report by the Alliance for Quality Education and other advocates, New York State owes its public schools $5.9 billion in Foundation Aid and Gap Elimination Adjustment funding; and\n      Whereas, New York City is currently owed more than $2.5 billion, according to that same report; and\n      Whereas, The State has not yet fully implemented the funding increases that the Legislature committed to in settlement of CFE v. State of New York which required that the State meet its constitutional obligation to provide essential resources to all public school children to give them the opportunity for a sound basic education; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the New York State Legislature to fully implement the education funding requirements for New York City resulting from the Campaign for Fiscal Equity v State of New York case.\nLS# 2692\nJA\n2/24/15\n\n\n\n1",
