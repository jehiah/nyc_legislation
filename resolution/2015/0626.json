For the purposes hereof, the following terms shall have the following meanings:\n\n(a)\t\"Company\" shall mean Schervier Apartments, LLC.\n\n(b)\t\"Effective Date\" shall mean the later of (i) the date of conveyance of the Exemption Area to the HDFC, and (ii) the date that HPD and the Owner enter into the Regulatory Agreement.\n\n(c)\t\"Exemption Area\" shall mean the real property located in the Borough of Bronx, City and State of New York, identified as Block 5750, Lot 500 on the Tax Map of the City of New York.\n\n(d) \"Expiration Date\" shall mean the earlier to occur of (i) a date which is thirty-five (35) years from the Effective Date, (ii) the date of the expiration or termination of the Regulatory Agreement, or (iii) the date upon which the Exemption Area ceases to be owned by either a housing development fund company or an entity wholly controlled by a housing development fund company.\n\n(e)\t\"HDFC\" shall mean Bon Secours New York Housing Development Fund Corporation.\n\n(f)\t\"HPD\" shall mean the Department of Housing Preservation and Development of the City of New York.\n\n(g)\t\"New Exemption\" shall mean the exemption from real property taxation provided hereunder with respect to the Exemption Area.\n\n(h)\t\"Owner\" shall mean, collectively, the HDFC and the Company.\n\n(i)\t\"Prior Exemption\" shall mean the exemption from real property taxation for the Exemption Area approved by the Board of Estimate on April 28, 1983 (Cal. No. 300).\n\n(j)\t\"Regulatory Agreement\" shall mean the regulatory agreement between HPD and the Owner establishing certain controls upon the operation of the Exemption Area during the term of the New Exemption.\n\n(k)\t\"Shelter Rent\" shall mean the total rents received from the commercial and rental occupants of the Exemption Area, including any federal subsidy (including, but not limited to, Section 8, rent supplements, and rental assistance), less the cost of providing to such occupants electricity, gas, heat and other utilities.\n\n (l)\t\"Shelter Rent Tax\" shall mean $250,000 plus (ii) an additional amount equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the amount by which the total contract rents applicable to the housing project for that year (as adjusted and established pursuant to Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended), exceed the total contract rents which are authorized as of six (6) months from the Effective Date. \n\n2.\tThe Prior Exemption shall terminate upon the Effective Date.\n\n3.\tAll of the value of the property, including both the land and the improvements (excluding those portions, if any, devoted to business or commercial use), shall be exempt from real property taxation, other than assessments for local improvements, for a period commencing upon the Effective Date and terminating upon the Expiration Date.\n\n4.\tCommencing upon the Effective Date and during each year thereafter until the Expiration Date, the Owner shall make annual real property tax payments in the sum of the Shelter Rent Tax.
