No. 2044 of 2001, to extend the tax exemption for properties owned and operated by Mutual Redevelopment Houses, Inc.

No. 813 of 2011); and \n      \n\tWHEREAS, In Section 1 of such Sixth Amendatory Agreement, the City and the Housing Company agreed to amend Paragraph 105 of that certain Agreement, dated as of July 1, 1987, between the Housing Company and the City, as amended by an Amendatory Agreement dated as of November, 1990, and further amended by a Second Amendatory Agreement dated as of July 1, 1995, and by a Third Amendatory Agreement dated as of August 22, 2001, and by a Fourth Amendatory Agreement dated as of October 6, 2005, and by a Fifth Amendatory Agreement dated as of January 17, 2006 (collectively, including the Sixth Amendatory Agreement,  \"City Agreement\"), to add a new subparagraph (B) to Paragraph 105 of the City Agreement, to provide, among other things, that, subject to the enactment of the Article V Mutual Authorizing Legislation and the enactment of a resolution by the City Council:\n\n\t\t\"... the City agrees to and hereby does grant an additional exemption and exempts from local and municipal taxes, all of the value of the portion of the Redevelopment Project owned by the Housing Company  which is taxed as residential pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, for the period commencing with the City's tax year July 1, 2022 through June 30, 2023, and continuing through the City's tax year July 1, 2029 through June 30, 2030, provided that the amount of taxes to be paid by the Housing Company during each such tax year shall be an amount equal to the greater of (i) ten per centum of the annual rent or carrying charges of the Housing Company minus utilities for the residential portion of the Redevelopment Project or (ii) the taxes paid by the Housing Company for the residential portion of the Redevelopment Project in the City's tax year July 1, 2000 through June 30, 2001, in the total amount of $3,477,099.00 (the 'Additional Exemption') ...\" ;  \nand  \n      \n      WHEREAS, The Article V Mutual Authorizing Legislation has been enacted by the State Legislature; and\n      \n      WHEREAS, The Council of the City of New York has determined that, given the tremendous growth in real property values in the Exemption Area, which has caused real property taxes to increase beyond the means of the primarily low- and moderate-income tenants who reside therein, it is in the interest of the City to assist the Housing Company in maintaining affordable rents and carrying charges by granting an additional exemption as authorized by Section 125(1)(a-4) of the Private Housing Finance Law; and\n \n      WHEREAS, The Council of the City of New York has considered the financial implications relating to the extended partial exemption from real property taxes; and \n      \n      WHEREAS, The Fifth Amendatory Agreement to the City Agreement established guidelines, set forth in Section 209, subsection (a)(iii)(B), that, among other things, provided in subsection (a)(iii)(B)(4) of such Section 209, that certain loans made by lenders to cooperators of the Housing Company to finance their purchases of their apartments \"... shall not exceed one-half (1/2) of the [purchase] price being paid by such tenant/cooperator[s] ...\" for their apartments; and\n\n      WHEREAS, Due to increases in those purchase prices resulting from such factors as increases in amortization paid to outgoing cooperators of  the Housing Company and equity assessments required to be paid by the Housing Company's cooperators, it has become more difficult for some purchasers to assemble the funds needed to purchase their apartments; and \n      \n      WHEREAS, Such purchases by  purchasers can be facilitated by increasing the allowed amount of loans to such  purchasers from the currently allowed one-half (1/2) of the purchase price to up to three-quarters (3/4) of the purchase price; and\n      \n      WHEREAS, Subsection (a)(iii)(C) of such Section 209 as amended by the Fifth Amendatory Agreement also provided that the  guidelines could be modified from time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors of the Housing Company, subject to the written approval of HPD and the approval of the City Council; and\n      \n      WHEREAS, By a resolution adopted March 17, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Housing Company approved the modification to the guidelines  authorizing the increase in the allowed amount of loans to purchasers; and\n      \n      WHEREAS, HPD has indicated it also will approve such increase in the allowed amount of such loans by executing the Seventh Amendatory Agreement once it is approved by the City Council; and\n      \n      WHEREAS, The Seventh Amendatory Agreement revises Section 209, subsection (a)(iii)(B)(4) of the  City Agreement to permit financing of up to three-quarters (3/4) of the purchase price; now, therefore, be it\n      \n      RESOLVED:\n \n           The Council of the City of New York hereby: \n\n1.
