For the purposes hereof, the following terms shall have the following meanings:\n\n(1) \"Company\"\" shall mean PRC Andrews Avenue LLC.\n\n(2) \"Current Owner\" shall mean Esperanza Village Associates L.P. and Maria Estela Houses II Associates L.P.\n\n(3) \"Effective Date\" shall mean the later of (i) the date of conveyance of the Exemption Area to the HDFC, or (ii) the date that HPD and the New Owner enter into the HPD Regulatory Agreement.\n\n(4) \"Exemption Area\" shall mean the real property located in the Borough of Bronx, City and State of New York, identified as Block 2713, Lot 2, and Block 2878, Lots 170 and 178 on the Tax Map of the City of New York.\n\n(5) \"Expiration Date\" shall mean the earlier to occur of (i) a date which is thirty-five (35) years from the Effective Date, (ii) the date of the expiration or termination of the HPD Regulatory Agreement, or (iii) the date upon which the Exemption Area ceases to be owned by either a housing development fund company or an entity wholly controlled by a housing development fund company.\n\n(6) \"HDFC\" shall mean Andrews/Kelly Housing Development Fund Corporation.\n\n(7) \"HPD\" shall mean the Department of Housing Preservation and Development of the City of New York.\n\n(8) \"HPD Regulatory Agreement\" shall mean the regulatory agreement between HPD and the New Owner establishing certain controls upon the operation of the Exemption Area during the term of the New Exemption.\n\n(9) \"New Exemption\" shall mean the exemption from real property taxation provided hereunder with respect to the Exemption Area.\n\n(10) \"New Owner\" shall mean, collectively, the HDFC and the Company.\n\n(11) \"PHFL\" shall mean the Private Housing Finance Law.\n\n(12) \"Prior Exemption\" shall mean the exemptions from real property taxation for the Exemption Area approved by the Board of Estimate on July 17, 1980 (Cal.

If the noncompliance specified in such notice is not cured within the time period specified therein, the New Exemption shall prospectively terminate.\n\n(2)\tThe New Exemption shall apply to all land in the Exemption Area, but shall only apply to buildings in the Exemption Area that exist on the Effective Date.\n\n(3)\tNothing herein shall entitle the HDFC to a refund of any real property taxes which accrued and were paid with respect to the Exemption Area prior to the Effective Date.\n\ne.\tIn consideration of the New Exemption, the owner of the Exemption Area shall, for so long as the New Exemption shall remain in effect, waive the benefits of any additional or concurrent exemption from or abatement of real property taxation which may be authorized under any existing or future local, state or federal law, rule or regulation.\n\n      The Council approves, pursuant to Section 125 of the PHFL, the Termination of the Prior Exemption, which termination shall become effective one day preceding the conveyance of the Exemption Area from the Current Owner to the New Owner.\n\n      The Council consents, pursuant to Section 123(4) of the PHFL, to the voluntary Dissolution of the Current Owner.\n\n      If (i) the conveyance of the Exemption Area from the Current Owner to the New Owner does not occur within one day following the termination of the Prior Exemption, or (ii) the conveyance of the Exemption Area from the Current Owner to the New Owner does not occur on the same day as the voluntary dissolution of the Current Owner, then all of the approvals and consents set forth above shall be null and void and both the obligations of the Current Owner to remain an Article V redevelopment company and the Prior Exemption shall be reinstated as though they had never been terminated or interrupted.\n\nAdopted.\n\n   \tOffice of the City Clerk, }\n   \tThe City of New York,  } ss.:\n\n  \t  \tI hereby certify that the foregoing is a true copy of a Resolution passed by The Council of The City of New York on May 27, 2015, on file in this office.\n\n\n\n\n.................................................\n  \t   \t       \t       \t       \t     \t\t\tCity Clerk, Clerk of The Council\n\nPage 2 of 2\n20155570 HAX\nRes.
