All of the value of the buildings, structures, and other improvements situated on the Exemption Area shall be exempt from local and municipal real property taxation, other than assessments for local improvements and land value, for a period of twenty years, during the last ten years of which such exemption shall decrease in equal annual decrements.  Such exemption shall commence on the January 1st or July 1st (whichever shall first occur) after rehabilitation of the building on the Exemption Area has been substantially completed and a temporary or permanent Certificate of Occupancy for such building, if required, has been issued by the Department of Buildings.\n\nb. The tax exemption granted hereunder shall terminate with respect to all or any portion of the Exemption Area if HPD determines that such real property has not been, or is not being, developed, used, and/or operated in compliance with the requirements of all applicable agreements made by the Sponsor or the owner of such real property with, or for the benefit of, the City of New York or HUD.  HPD shall deliver written notice of any such determination of noncompliance to the owner of such real property and all mortgagees of record, which notice shall provide for an opportunity to cure of not less than ninety (90) days.  If the noncompliance specified in such notice is not cured within the time period specified therein, the partial tax exemption granted hereunder shall prospectively terminate with respect to the real property specified therein.\n\nAdopted.\n\n\n      \tOffice of the City Clerk, }\n      \tThe City of New York,  } ss.:\n\n      \t   \tI hereby certify that the foregoing is a true copy of a Resolution passed by The Council of The City of New York on June 10, 2015, on file in this office.\n\n\n\n\n      \t       \t       \t       \t      \t\t\t\t\t................................................\n      \t City Clerk, Clerk of The Council\n\nPage 2 of 2\n20155685 HAR\nRes.
