Braunstein, currently pending in the New York State Assembly, would establish a new property tax classification, Class 2, consisting solely of properties held in cooperative or condominium form; and\n      Whereas, Specifically, the legislation would amend the current property tax Class 2 to consist of only cooperatives or condominiums and add a new property tax Class 5 to consist of all residential property that is not classified as Class 1 or Class 2; and\n      Whereas, Further, the legislation would extend the assessment caps of 8% in any one year and 30% in any five years to all Class 2 properties, including cooperatives and condominiums with 11 units or more; and\n      Whereas, The legislation would ensure that all cooperatives and condominiums are treated equally for property tax purposes and that larger cooperatives and condominiums do not see dramatic increases in their property taxes in any given year; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign  S.4371/A.608, legislation which would establish a new property tax classification for properties held in condominium and cooperative form.\n      \nGP\nLS# 3423\n03/18/2015\n       \n      \n\n1",
