For the purposes hereof, the following terms shall have the following meanings:\n\n(a)\t\"Effective Date\" shall mean the date of repayment or refinancing of the HUD Mortgage.\n\n(b)\t\"Exemption Area\" shall mean the real property located in the Borough of Brooklyn, City and State of New York, identified as Block 2365, Lot 19, and Block 2360, Lots 1, 4, and 6 on the Tax Map of the City of New York.\n\n(c)\t\"Expiration Date\" shall mean the earlier to occur of (i) a date which is thirty-five (35) years from the Effective Date, (ii) the date of the expiration or termination of the Regulatory Agreement, or (iii) the date upon which the Exemption Area ceases to be owned by either a housing development fund company or an entity wholly controlled by a housing development fund company.\n\n(d)\t\"HDFC\" shall mean Monsignor Alexius Jarka Hall Development Fund Company, Inc.\n\n(e)\t\"HPD\" shall mean the Department of Housing Preservation and Development of the City of New York.\n\n(f)\t\"HUD\" shall mean the Department of Housing and Urban Development of the United States of America. \n\n(g)\t\"HUD Mortgage\" shall mean the original loan made by HUD to the HDFC in connection with the Section 202 Supportive Housing Program for the Elderly, which loan was secured by a mortgage on the Exemption Area.\n\n(h)\t\"New Exemption\" shall mean the exemption from real property taxation provided hereunder with respect to the Exemption Area.\n\n(i)\t\"Owner\" shall mean, collectively, the HDFC and the Partnership.\n\n(j)\t\"Partnership\" shall mean Jarka Hall, L.P.\n\n(k)\t\"Prior Exemption\" shall mean the exemption from real property taxation for the Exemption Area approved by the Council of The City of New York on August 22, 2007 (Res. No. 1009).\n\n(l)\t\"Regulatory Agreement\" shall mean a regulatory agreement between HPD and the Owner establishing certain controls upon the operation of the Exemption Area during the term of the New Exemption.\n\n(m)\t\"Use Agreement\" shall mean the use agreement by and between the Owner and HUD which commences on or before the Effective Date, runs with the land, binds all subsequent owners and creditors of the Exemption Area, and requires that the   Exemption Area continue to operate on terms at least as advantageous to existing and future tenants as the terms required by the original Section 202 loan agreement or any Section 8 rental assistance payments contract or any other rental housing assistance contract and all applicable federal regulations.\n\n2. The Prior Exemption shall terminate upon the Effective Date.\n\n3. All of the value of the property in the Exemption Area, including both the land and any improvements (excluding those portions, if any, devoted to business or commercial use), shall be exempt from real property taxation, other than assessments for local improvements, for a period commencing upon the Effective Date and terminating upon the Expiration Date.\n\n4. Commencing upon the Effective Date, and during each year thereafter until the Expiration Date, the Owner shall make real property tax payments in the sum of (i) $138,527, plus (ii) an additional amount equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the amount by which the total contract rents applicable to the housing project for that year (as adjusted and established pursuant to Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended) exceed the total contract rents which are authorized as of the Effective Date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the total annual real property tax payment by the Owner shall not at any time exceed the amount of real property taxes that would otherwise be due in the absence of any form of exemption from or abatement of real property taxation provided by an existing or future local, state, or federal law, rule, or regulation.\n\n5.

If the noncompliance specified in such notice is not cured within the time period specified therein, the New Exemption shall prospectively terminate.\n\n(b)\tThe New Exemption shall apply to all land in the Exemption Area, but shall only apply to a building in the Exemption Area that exists on the Effective Date.\n\n(c)\tNothing herein shall entitle the HDFC to a refund of any real property taxes which accrued and were paid with respect to the Exemption Area prior to the Effective Date.\n\n(d)\tAll previous resolutions, if any, providing an exemption from or abatement of real property taxation with respect to the Exemption Area are hereby revoked.\n\n6. In consideration of the New Exemption, prior to or simultaneous with repayment or refinancing of the HUD Mortgage, the Owner, for itself, its successors and assigns, shall (i) execute and record a Use Agreement, (ii) execute and record a Regulatory Agreement, and (iii) waive, for so long as the New Exemption shall remain in effect,  the benefits of any additional or concurrent exemption from or abatement of real property taxation which may be authorized under any existing or future local, state or federal law, rule or regulation. \n\nOffice of the City Clerk,     }\t\t\t\nThe City of New York        } ss.:\n\nI hereby certify that the foregoing is a true copy of a Resolution passed by The Council of the City of New York on December 16, 2015, on file in this office.\n                                          _______________________\n                                          City Clerk, Clerk of Council",
