  "Text": "By Council Members Ulrich, Chin, Koslowitz, Mendez, Gentile and Rosenthal \n\n\tWhereas, The Servicemember Assistance for Lawful Understanding, Treatment and Education (SALUTE) Act would authorize the United States Attorney General to award grants for developing, implementing, or enhancing Veterans Treatment Courts or expanding operational mental health or drug courts to serve veterans to ensure that such courts effectively integrate substance abuse treatment, mental health treatment for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and other conditions, sanctions and incentives, and transitional services; and\n      Whereas, According to the United States Veterans Administration (VA), there are more than 200,000 veterans living in New York City; and\n      Whereas, According to studies by the Rand Institute, at least 20% of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans suffer from PTSD and/or depression; and\n      Whereas, According to the Rand Institute, 50% of those with PTSD do not seek treatment and only half of those get adequate treatment; and\n      Whereas, According to testimony before the New York City Council by the Office of the Queens County District Attorney, Veterans Treatment Courts are highly successful but would benefit greatly from the funding of paid mentors, rather than the volunteers currently utilized; and\n      Whereas, According to this testimony before the New York City Council by the Office of the Queens County District Attorney, funding for paid personnel to identify eligible candidates, conduct screening and perform clinical assessments would allow the court to expand its scope and help more veterans; and\n      Whereas, Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens Counties currently have established Veterans Treatment Courts and Richmond County is building a new courthouse to include one in the near future; and \n\tWhereas, According to testimony before the New York City Council by Public Advocate Letitia James, funding is the major obstacle to establishing a Veterans Treatment Court in New York County;  now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on Congress to pass and the President to sign the Servicemember Assistance for Lawful Understanding, Treatment and Education (SALUTE) Act of 2015.\n      \n\n\nKJR\nLS 4433\n4/8/15",
