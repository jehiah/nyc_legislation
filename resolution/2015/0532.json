  "Text": "By The Speaker (Council Member Mark-Viverito) and Council Members Cumbo, Johnson, Chin, Constantinides, Dickens, Eugene, Gentile, Gibson, Koo, Lander, Levine, Mendez, Richards, Rose, Crowley, Kallos, Cohen, Rodriguez, Cornegy and Williams\n\n      Whereas, According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), HPV is so common that nearly all sexually active men and women contract it at some point in their lives; and\n\tWhereas, According to the CDC, roughly 79 million Americans are currently infected with human papillomavirus; and \n      Whereas, According to the National Cancer Institute (NCI), HPV infections account for approximately five percent of all cancers worldwide; and\n\tWhereas, According to NCI, HPV infections can cause genital warts, cervical cancer, anal cancer, vaginal cancer, vulvar cancer, penile cancer, and oropharyngeal cancer; and\n\tWhereas, The American Cancer Society (ACS) estimates that HPV infections are responsible for nearly all cervical cancers and anal cancers, about seventy percent of all vaginal cancers and vulvar cancers, roughly sixty percent of all penile cancers, and over seventy percent of all oropharyngeal cancers; and\n\tWhereas, The CDC estimates that about 10,000 women in the United States are diagnosed with cervical cancer annually; and\n      Whereas, According to CDC, approximately 4,000 women in the United States die each year as a result of contracting cervical cancer; and\n      Whereas, HPV-related anal and oropharyngeal cancers rates are rising; and,\n      Whereas, The CDC estimates that about 21,000 HPV-related cancers could be prevented each year by getting vaccinated for HPV; and\n      Whereas, Two vaccines, Gardasil and Cervarix, are available to the public and protect against the most common types of HPV; and\n      Whereas, Cervarix prevents the two HPV types which cause 70 percent of cervical cancers; and \n      Whereas, Gardasil prevents four types of HPV and has been shown to protect against genital warts and cancers of the anus, vagina and vulva, in addition to cervical cancer; and\n      Whereas, Gardasil 9 is a new vaccine that will be distributed beginning February 2015; it prevents nine types of HPV and has the potential to prevent up to 90 percent of cervical, vulvar, vaginal and anal cancers, as well as genital warts; and  \n      Whereas, The vaccines are administered in three doses over a period of six months; and\n\tWhereas, The CDC recommends that all boys and girls ages 11 and 12 receive the vaccines, and that young women and men can be vaccinated up to the age of 26; and\n      Whereas, The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and CDC recommend administering the vaccines at a young age when immune response is highest and before sexual activity and possible exposure to HPV;
