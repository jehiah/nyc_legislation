Circaseptan (Weekly) Rhythms in Healthy Considerations,\" American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2014), have demonstrated that people are more likely to try to quit smoking, begin a diet or exercise regimen, schedule a doctors' appointment, or adopt other health behaviors on Monday than any other day; and\n      Whereas, According to the Johns Hopkins' website, \"In 2000, the Surgeon General released the Healthy People 2010 report outlining health objectives for the nation to serve as goals for the next decade. Healthy People 2010 specifically called for a 15% reduction in saturated fat in the American diet.
