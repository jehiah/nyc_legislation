  "Text": "Whereas, In December 2025, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) launched \"Operation Metro Surge\" which saw the deployment of over 3,000 masked and armed federal agents in the Twin Cities; and\n      Whereas, In a statement to Newsmax on January 6, 2026, the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Todd Lyons said that federal immigration authorities were carrying out \"the largest operation ever\" in Minnesota; and\n      Whereas, The operation has been destabilizing and traumatizing to the community and residents have increasingly exercised their First Amendment right to protest and observe the actions of the federal government; and\n      Whereas, On January 7, 2026, one day after ICE Acting Director Lyons called the actions in Minnesota \"the largest operation ever\", an ICE agent reportedly shot and killed Ren�e Nicole Good, a 37-year-old United States citizen; and\n      Whereas, Reports indicate the White House and DHS responded to the shooting with claims that the agent acted in self-defense and Good was a domestic terrorist; and\n      Whereas, However, video evidence from the shooting and subsequent reporting have disputed the claims of the federal government and instead show Good trying to follow the mixed instructions from ICE agents and drive away from the scene only to be shot and killed; and\n      Whereas, In an article from The Guardian, it was reported that state officials have been denied access to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) inquiry into the shooting and the federal officials are instead focusing their investigation on the widow of Good and the democratic leaders in Minnesota; and\n      Whereas, The Department of Justice (DOJ) also stated evidence clears the officer of wrongdoing; and\n      Whereas, After the DOJ pushed for an investigation of the widow of Good, a wave of federal prosecutors in Minnesota resigned, and shortly after that a supervisor in the FBI's Minneapolis field office resigned after being unable to investigate the ICE agent reportedly responsible for the shooting; and\n      Whereas, Less than three weeks after the murder of Good, on January 24, 2026, federal immigration authorities shot and killed 37-year old intensive care nurse and United States citizen Alex Jeffrey Pretti.; and\n      Whereas, Reports indicate DHS Secretary Kristi Noem immediately attempted to paint Pretti as a domestic terrorist saying he approached the authorities with a \"semi-automatic handgun\" and \"reacted violently\"; and\n      Whereas, However, video evidence and subsequent reporting once again proved that DHS and the White House were lying at worst and mistaken at best; and\n      Whereas, While protesting the actions of federal immigration authorities, Pretti had his phone raised to record the multiple officers' actions; and\n      Whereas, Pretti was then pepper sprayed by officers, pinned to the street, and shot 10 times in seconds; and\n      Whereas, It is unclear what, if any, investigations are taking place, although two officers that fired their guns during the fatal shooting have been placed on administrative leave; and\n      Whereas, Operation Metro Surge has allegedly led to two deaths at the hands of immigration authorities, and as indicated in a lawsuit brought by Minnesota and Illinois against the Trump Administration has also resulted in the arrests of peaceful bystanders, detaining of United States citizens, launching chemical irritants at protestors, and racial profiling of residents; and\n      Whereas, Despite the assertions of DHS and the White House, the operation has not made the community safer and according to the Minneapolis Chief of Police has complicated local policing; and\n      Whereas, The unsubstantiated claims made by DHS about Pretti and Good are disturbing but unsurprising when considering how the federal government perceives observers and protestors; and\n      Whereas, In a December 2025 report from the Cato Institute it was noted that DOJ and the federal government have been unconstitutionally labeling ICE observers as domestic terrorists; and\n      Whereas, DHS Secretary Noem has publicly referred to the filming of officers as \"assault\" and has stated that federal immigration officers need to remain anonymous to protect themselves; and\n      Whereas, However, in a January 2026 report from the Cato Institute, the author reports that 2025 was the 2nd safest year for Border Patrol and ICE agents; and\n      Whereas, The fabrications being made by the federal government in response to the killings of Minnesota residents by federal immigration agents are unbelievably disturbing; and\n      Whereas, Video evidence is available that fully discounts the claims of the federal government and yet the Trump Administration and its followers perpetuate their belief that the federal immigration agents in Minnesota acted appropriately; and\n      Whereas, The killings of Good and Pretti are part of a horrifying trend of federal immigration authorities' violence; and\n      Whereas, In 2026 alone, six immigrants have died in ICE custody, including, Luis Gustavo N��ez C�ceres, Geraldo Lunas Campos, V�ctor Manuel D�az, Parady La, Luis Beltr�n Y��ez-Cruz, Heber S�nchez Dom�nguez; and\n      Whereas, On December 31, 2025, Keith Porter Jr., a United States citizen, was fatally shot by an off-duty ICE officer outside Porter Jr.'s apartment complex during a New Year's Eve celebration; and\n      Whereas, These examples only further exemplify the irreparable harm and pervasive violence caused by federal immigration actions; and\n      Whereas, Neighborhoods across New York City have already reported increased presence and aggression of federal immigration authorities since the beginning of the second Trump Administration; and\n      Whereas, The Trump Administration continues to threaten New York City with a flood of federal immigrations authorities, but the operations occurring in Minnesota are unwelcome anywhere in the United States, including New York City; and\n      Whereas, Federal agents have acted with impunity and the lack of accountability after people have been killed at the hands of federal immigration agents is disgusting and shameful, and the people of Minnesota who continue to protest in freezing temperatures deserve better; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York condemns the fatal shootings of Ren�e Nicole Good and Alex Jeffrey Pretti by federal immigration authorities. \n\n\nLS #21408/21415/21671\n1/28/2026\nRLB",
