  "Text": "Whereas, COVID-19 is still a threat to New York City (NYC), with the New York State Department of Health (DOH) finding that there were 178 positive COVID-19 tests on January 28, 2026 in NYC, and that at its 2025 peak on March 20, there were 657 positive tests and a concurrent seven-day average cases per 100,000 rate of 8.0 in NYC; and\n\tWhereas, According to the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), influenza, or the flu, kills 1,500 to 2,000 NYC residents each year; and\n\tWhereas, According to DOHMH, the human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States, with over 40 million people currently infected; and\n\tWhereas, According to DOHMH, before the HPV vaccine became available, 80% to 90% of people were infected with HPV at some point in their lives, increasing their risk of various cancers including; (1) cervical; (2) anal; (3) vaginal: (4) oropharyngeal; (5) vulvar; and (6) penile; and\n\tWhereas, According to an article published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, childhood vaccination rates are still below pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels; and\n\tWhereas, In NYC, for example, according to DOHMH, influenza vaccination rates for children aged six months to 17 years have fallen from 51% at the end of 2020-2021 flu season to just 43% at the end of the 2024-2025 flu season; and\n\tWhereas, This decline is particularly concerning given that NYC is seeing a record-breaking flu season according to DOHMH, and that last flu season was the deadliest for children on record, with 289 dying from the virus nationwide, 89% of whom were unvaccinated; and\n\tWhereas, According to an article published in the Journal of the American Dental Association (JADA), prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, four states authorized dentists to administer influenza vaccines including: (1) Illinois; (2) Louisiana; (3) Minnesota; and (4) Oregon; and\n\tWhereas, During the COVID-19 pandemic, all 50 states authorized dentists to administer the COVID-19 vaccine to patients due to urgent need and high demand, and while the end of the public health emergency meant that these special provisions were lifted, several states, including New Jersey, passed legislation which authorized dentists to administer vaccines even outside of a health emergency; and\n\tWhereas, While the vaccines dentists are authorized to administer vary by state, with some allowing dentists to administer any vaccine and others only allowing for the administration of specific vaccines, such as the COVID-19, HPV, or influenza vaccines, it is expected that more states will follow suit and authorize dentists to administer at least some vaccines; and\n\tWhereas, According to the New York State Education Department (NYSED), the educational requirements for licensure as a dentist in New York State (NYS) include 60 semester hours of preprofessional education and a program of professional education of at least four academic years, or the equivalent thereof, in a program registered by NYSED as licensure qualifying, accredited by an organization acceptable to NYSED, or recognized by the appropriate civil authorities of the country in which the school is located; and\n\tWhereas, This is roughly equivalent to the educational requirements for licensure as a pharmacist in NYC, which, according to NYSED, require one to complete a program in pharmacy leading to a bachelor's degree or higher from a pharmacy program accredited by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education or the appropriate civil authority of the jurisdiction in which the school is located; and\n\tWhereas, NYS education laws permit licensed pharmacists who obtain an additional certification to administer influenza vaccines to anyone aged two years or older and HPV and COVID-19 vaccines to anyone aged 18 years or older; and\n\tWhereas, According to ABC News, despite assurances from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. about COVID-19 vaccine access, confusion as to current regulations left some pharmacies reticent and selective in their provision of vaccines, threatening access and highlighting the need for more points of access; and\n\tWhereas, In order to provide more points of access to vaccinations, State Senator Toby Anne Stavisky and Assemblymember David I. Weprin introduced two bills in the New York State Senate and Assembly respectively; and\n\tWhereas, The first bill, S.4548/A.3892, would authorize dentists to administer vaccinations preventing HPV; and\n\tWhereas, The second bill, S.6744A/A.3894A, would authorize dentists to administer influenza vaccines, COVID-19 vaccines, and any vaccination related to a declared public health emergency; and\n\tWhereas, Both bills, which had passed the Senate but were returned after lapsing in the Assembly, would expand access to vaccines, which are crucial to the protection of NYC and its residents' health and wellness; now, therefore, be it\n\tResolved, that the Council of the City of New York calls on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.4548/A.3892 and S.6744A/A.3894A, legislation authorizing dentists to administer influenza vaccines, COVID-19 vaccines, human papillomavirus vaccines, or a vaccine related to a public health emergency.\nJN\nLS 20718\n2/3/2026",
