  "Text": "Whereas, New York City relies on a complex and rapidly evolving technology ecosystem to support its operations, including digital service delivery, cybersecurity, data management, software development, network infrastructure, and emerging technologies that sustain essential public programs and public-facing services; and\n      Whereas, The City's ability to attract, develop, and retain a highly skilled technology workforce is essential to ensuring effective government operations, protecting sensitive data, and meeting the expectations of residents; and\n      Whereas, New York City employs thousands of civil servants across technology-related titles, including, but not limited to, Computer Specialist, Systems Administrator, Information Technology (IT) Service Management titles, City Research Scientist, Cybersecurity Analyst, and various titles involving data analytics, application development, and digital product management; and\n      Whereas, The Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) is responsible for developing, maintaining, and updating job specifications and minimum qualification requirements for civil service titles, and plays a critical role in shaping the City's long-term workforce; and\n      Whereas, Rigid, degree-centric minimum qualifications in civil service job specifications can act as a barrier to entry for candidates who have acquired strong, industry-aligned skills and relevant experience through innovative pathways; and\n      Whereas, These barriers can limit the City's ability to build a robust and diverse talent pipeline for technology roles and hinder agencies' ability to fill critical vacancies; and\n      Whereas, Minimum qualification requirements for many civil service technology titles may no longer fully reflect the competencies, learning pathways, or industry standards that characterize the modern tech workforce; and\n      Whereas, Technology career pathways have grown increasingly diverse, with many highly qualified candidates gaining experience not through traditional four-year or advanced degrees, but through non-traditional and skills-based approaches such as apprenticeships, technical fellowships, employer-based training programs, technology bootcamps, stackable credential programs, military training, and community-based workforce development initiatives; and\n      Whereas, Many of these non-traditional pathways are particularly crucial for expanding access to well-paid technology jobs to communities historically underrepresented in the tech sector, including low-income New Yorkers, immigrants, individuals without college degrees, and those seeking second-chance opportunities; and\n      Whereas, Other jurisdictions have revised minimum qualification standards, including the federal government; and\n      Whereas, In 2024, the federal Office of Personnel Management announced it would revise qualification, classification, and assessment standards for the federal IT workforce to better emphasize skills and reduce reliance on traditional degree requirements; and\n      Whereas, Modernizing minimum qualifications to better recognize hands-on, experience-based training would expand access to civil service opportunities, improve hiring equity, strengthen the City's competitiveness in recruiting tech talent, and more accurately reflect the ways in which New Yorkers acquire skills in today's labor market; now, therefore, be it,\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) to review and modernize minimum qualification requirements for technology-based civil service titles to better recognize experience gained through fellowships, apprenticeships, and other non-traditional pathways.\n\nEA\nLS #20355\nRes. #1189-2025\n1/6/2026 1:44 PM\n2",
