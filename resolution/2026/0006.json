  "Text": "By The Speaker (Council Member Menin) and Council Members Marte, Louis and Morano\n      Whereas, On September 11, 2001, the deadliest terror attacks ever launched against our nation struck the World Trade Center in New York City (NYC), along with the Pentagon in our nation's capital and an open field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, which became the crash site of hijacked United Airlines Flight 93; and\n      Whereas, September 11, 2026, marks the solemn 25th anniversary of those attacks; and\n      Whereas, In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, the people of the United States (U.S.) united to support the grieving families of the victims, and soon over 250,000 Americans joined the U.S. military to fight ongoing perceived threats and to remind the world of our strength of character; and \n      Whereas, NYC residents will always have a lasting special connection to that never-to-be-forgotten day, whether as private citizens who observed the collapse of the Twin Towers, as heroic first responders who rushed to the site without regard for their own safety, or as family members and friends of those who perished there; and\n      Whereas, Even today, many NYC residents continue to suffer from the physical and emotional effects of that day, including those first responders whose health was heartbreakingly damaged beyond repair; and\n      Whereas, A generation of Americans is now too young to remember the events of September 11 firsthand, though it continues to shape their lives in so many ways, and thousands of NYC children and youth are part of the generation born into families of September 11 victims, but never knew their family members taken so senselessly; and \n      Whereas, Opened on the 10th anniversary of the attacks, Manhattan's 9/11 Memorial, which occupies about eight acres of the former World Trade Center complex, features twin waterfall pools, which rest in the footprints of the former North and South Towers and are surrounded by bronze parapets listing the 2,983 names of the 9/11 victims from all three crash sites that day as well as the victims of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; and\n      Whereas, Around the pools at the Memorial grow about 400 swamp white oak trees, which are native to the areas of all three 9/11 crash sites; and\n      Whereas, Annually on September 11, family members still gather at the Memorial to read aloud the names, one by one, of those who died that day and who are still missed; and \n      Whereas, Opened on the 17th anniversary of the attacks, the Memorial Glade of stone monoliths honors all who have become sick or have died from exposure to toxins as a result of the 9/11 attacks, including first responders, recovery and relief workers, volunteers, and lower Manhattan residents, students, and workers, including those who cleaned buildings near Ground Zero; and\n      Whereas, September 11 was established as Patriot Day in a joint resolution of the U.S. Congress (H.J. Res. 71) on December 18, 2001, which calls on the President to issue a yearly proclamation, including the observance of a moment of silence and the flying of flags at half-staff; and \n      Whereas, In Public Law No. 111-13 (April 21, 2019), the U.S. Congress called for September 11 be recognized each year as a National Day of Service and Remembrance to demonstrate the compassion and selflessness of the American people as they serve others in need; and \n      Whereas, In 2019, the New York State Senate and Assembly passed S.4166A/A.1801B, which established September 11th Remembrance Day and allowed for a moment of silence in public schools to commemorate the terrorist attacks and encourage classroom discussion; and \n      Whereas, During 2026, the NYC Fire Department (FDNY) will be honoring the 343 FDNY members who lost their lives on September 11 as well as the 400 who have succumbed to illnesses related to World Trade Center exposure since then; and\n      Whereas, On September 11, 2026, all New Yorkers will want to pause to pay tribute both to those who tragically lost their lives that day and to the resilience of the communities they left behind; now, therefore, be it\n\tResolved, That the Council of the City of New York commemorates the 25th anniversary of the September 11 attacks.\n\n\n\n\nLS #21298\n1/21/2026\nRHP\n\n2",
