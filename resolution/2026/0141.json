  "Text": "Whereas, In New York City (NYC), the Department of Transportation (DOT) maintains and installs NYC's parking regulation signs, posting thousands of parking regulations signs throughout the five boroughs; and \n      Whereas, These parking regulation signs indicate whether and when a vehicle may park, stop, or stand in a particular location; and  \n      Whereas, According to the NYC Department of Finance's Fiscal Year 2024 (FY24) Annual Report of NYC Parking Tickets and Camera Violations, there were 16,092,421 parking tickets and camera violations issued in FY24, resulting in $1,087,813,644 in issued violations; and \n      Whereas, Among the top 10 issued violation codes in FY24, there were millions of violations related to parking, including: 1.9 million violations (12.01% of all FY24 violations) issued for no parking for street cleaning violations; 1.2 million violations (7.37% of all FY24 violations) issued for failure to display a receipt in a parking meter space; 807,000 violations (5.01% of all FY24 violations) issued for no standing violations; and 626,000 violations (3.89% of all FY24 violations) issued for no parking violations; and \n      Whereas, This amounts to over 4.53 million violations (~28% of all FY24 violations) issued just from the top 10 issued violation codes in FY24 that are related to parking, with additional violations related to parking issued outside of the top 10 issued violation codes; and  \n      Whereas, Although millions of violations are issued each year related to parking, NYC may benefit from additional enforcement tools, such as automated camera enforcement systems, to improve the City's capacity to adequately enforce parking violations, and reduce the number of illegally parked cars that create hazardous street safety conditions for all road users; and  \n      Whereas, A.5440, sponsored by New York State Assemblymember Steven Raga, would authorize NYC to establish a new camera enforcement demonstration program that holds vehicle owners financially responsible when a car they own is photographed by cameras that are either mounted on City vehicles or along streets violating posted traffic control rules related to parking; and \n      Whereas, A.5440 would require that, if a vehicle is caught violating posted parking rules, the owner of the vehicle would receive a fine of at least $50 for the first offense to up to $250 for repeated violations in a 12-month period with the possibility of an additional $25 penalty if the owner does not respond to the ticket on time; and \n      Whereas, A.5440 would allow for NYC DOT to administer this program over six years as a pilot, after which it would expire unless renewed, and would require DOT to publish a report after two years, showing the location of the devices, number of tickets issued, revenue collected, system costs, and effectiveness of the program; and\n      Whereas, A.5440 would ultimately work to improve enforcement of posted parking violations, making streets less congested and safer for all road users; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the New York State Legislature to pass, and the New York State Governor to sign, A.5440, which imposes owner liability for failure of an operator to comply with traffic control indicators within the city of New York. \n\nKK\nLS #20108\nRes. #1024-2025\n1/6/2026 1:02 PM\n\n\n2",
