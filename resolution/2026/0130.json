  "Summary": "Calling on the developers of mobile navigation applications, including Google Maps, Apple Maps, and Waze, to incorporate a dedicated commercial vehicle option that integrates the Department of Transportation Truck Routes Map",
  "TextID": 81685,
  "Text": "Whereas, The trucking industry is a vital component of New York City's economy, employing over 8,000 New Yorkers and transporting close to 90% of goods that move into and throughout the City; and\n      Whereas, Congestion significantly impacts the trucking industry, resulting in the loss of 60.7 million hours of productivity in 2015, at an estimated cost of nearly $3.9 billion in New York City alone; and\n      Whereas, Mobile navigation applications have integrated real-time traffic data to help drivers avoid congested areas, enhancing route efficiency; and\n      Whereas, Due to these and other advancements in mobile technology, as of 2012, over half of truck drivers use their mobile phones' GPS functionality at a rate equal to or greater than traditional GPS devices; and\n      Whereas, Despite widespread adoption by truck drivers, many mobile navigation applications, including the three largest applications Google Maps, Apple Maps, and Waze, lack a dedicated feature for commercial vehicles, leaving drivers without optimal tools for avoiding restricted streets and other areas unsuitable for truck traffic; and\n      Whereas, The New York City Department of Transportation (DOT) publishes a comprehensive Truck Routes Map, which outlines the City's designated truck routes, including signage, weight limits, dimensions, permitting requirements, and truck-related violations; and\n      Whereas, While the DOT Truck Routes Map provides essential guidance for commercial drivers, it is difficult for drivers to use while operating their vehicle, and it does not feature real-time traffic data, limiting its effectiveness in mitigating congestion; and\n      Whereas, In 2024, New York City recorded over 3,500 noise complaints related to trucks reported to NYC311, including reports of loud music and engine noise, along with over 3,400 NYC311 complaints concerning trucks operating on unauthorized streets reported to NYC311, and between 2013 and 2018, there were over 400 incidents of bridge strikes, all contributing to safety hazards and neighborhood disruptions; and\n      Whereas, Integrating the DOT Truck Routes Map into mobile navigation applications with a dedicated commercial vehicle option would enable drivers to more easily avoid residential areas and restricted streets, thereby reducing noise complaints, truck route violations, traffic congestion, and bridge strikes, thereby enhancing quality of life, safety, and efficiency for all road users and residents; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the developers of mobile navigation applications, including Google Maps, Apple Maps, and Waze, to incorporate a dedicated commercial vehicle option that integrates the Department of Transportation Truck Routes Map. \n\n\nEB\nLS #17397\nRes. #0932-2025\n1/6/2026 9:32 AM\n\n\n\n2",
