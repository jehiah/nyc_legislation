  "Text": "Whereas, Under New York State Civil Service Law Section 85-B, the children and siblings of firefighters and police officers killed in the line of duty are allowed to receive ten additional points in a competitive examination for an original appointment in the same municipality in which his or her parent or sibling has served; and\n\tWhereas, Under New York State Civil Service Law Section 85-C, the children and siblings of emergency medical technicians and paramedics killed in the line of duty are also eligible for ten additional points in a competitive examination for an original appointment in the same municipality in which his or her parent or sibling has served; and\n\tWhereas, These provisions of State Law define \"killed in the line of duty\" as having died in the performance of duty as the natural and proximate result of the World Trade Center Attack on September 11, 2001 or as the natural and proximate result of participation in the rescue effort that was conducted in response to the attack; and\n\tWhereas, While these provisions honor the memory of many of the first responders who lost their lives as a result of the World Trade Center Attack, whether it be during the attacks or afterwards due to illness caused by debris, the law does not recognize the contributions and sacrifices made by sanitation members as first responders; and\n\tWhereas, According to DSNY Remembers, at least 117 former New York City Department of Sanitation (DSNY) members have died due to illness resulting from exposure to debris during and in the aftermath of the World Trade Center Attack; and\n\tWhereas, According to DSNY Remembers, 1,500 DSNY workers were dispatched to assist with debris removal and cleaning in the aftermath of the World Trade Center Attack; and\n\tWhereas, According to the 9/11 Memorial and Museum, sanitation members like Joseph D'Aleo, a DSNY supervisor, immediately responded to the attack by traveling to Ground Zero and distributing dust masks to first responders, and continuing to work at the sight daily for 12 months overseeing the disposal of appliances containing Freon and chlorofluorocarbon gas, recycling procedures, and refuse hauling; and\n\tWhereas, Like many, Joseph D'Aleo developed an illness due to his exposure to toxins at Ground Zero; and\n\tWhereas, While this illness has not killed Joseph D'Aleo, his story highlights the sacrifices and risks DSNY members took in the immediate aftermath of the World Trade Center Attack; and\n\tWhereas, According to DSNY Remembers, New York City's sanitation workers removed over 1.6 million tons of debris from Ground Zero; and\n\tWhereas, According to DSNY Remembers, 1.4 million tons of material were removed to Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island, where DSNY hosted an operation in conjunction with the New York City Police Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation that searched and screened said material, recovering more than 54,000 personal items; 1,358 vehicles; $78,318.47 in domestic and foreign currency; and 4,257 human remains, resulting in the identification of over 300 victims; and\n\tWhereas, According to DSNY Remembers, cleaning operations in Manhattan lasted for nine months and the Fresh Kills recovery operation lasted nearly ten months; and\n\tWhereas, DSNY members played a crucial role in New York City's recovery from the World Trade Center Attack and their sacrifices should be recognized alongside the sacrifices of all other first responders; now, therefore, be it\n\tResolved, that the Council of the City of New York calls on the New York State Legislature to introduce and pass, and the Governor to sign, legislation that would include the children and siblings of sanitation members killed as a result of the World Trade Center Attack among those who can receive additional credit on competitive examinations for an original appointment.\nJN\nLS #17933\nRes. #0739-2025\n1/5/2026 3:25 PM\n2",
