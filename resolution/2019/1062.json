Daneek Miller have publicly called for higher wages and increased benefits for our City's Best; and\n      Whereas, According to the FDNY, EMS Emergency Medical Technicians (\"EMT\") receive a starting salary of $35,254, which increases to only $50,604 after 5 years; and\n      Whereas, Additionally, EMS Paramedics receive a starting salary $48,237, which increases to only $65,226 after five years; and\n      Whereas, Starting salaries of the City's police officers and firefighters are nearly $8,000 more than that of EMS; and \n      Whereas, After five years of service, FDNY firefighters make approximately $110,000 including fringe benefits; and\n      Whereas, It is long overdue for the City to ensure that EMTs, Paramedics and EMS Officers are compensated fairly and offered substantial wage increases to ensure they are paid similar to other first responders; and\n      Whereas, Remedying this long-standing pay disparity would help provide equality among EMS and other emergency medical personnel in the New York City as well as boost moral for our City's Best; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls for the salaries of New York City emergency medical service personnel to be comparable to New York City's firefighters and police officers.\n\nWJH\n5/27/20\nLS 11553",
