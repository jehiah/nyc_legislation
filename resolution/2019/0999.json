Delays, problems with access and higher prices are all resulting from how PBMs are operating. They are pushing drug prices higher and placing extreme pressure on pharmacies because they want to steer that business toward themselves\"; and\n\tWhereas, The problems identified with PBM operations is a driving force behind the Prescription Pricing for the People Act of 2019; and\n\tWhereas, Introduced by Congressmen Doug Collins (R-GA) and Jerry Nadler (D-NY), this bill requires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to examine whether the actions of pharmacy benefit managers amounts to anti-competitive behavior; and  \n\tWhereas, Given that New Yorkers already pay the highest amount for their prescription drugs, it is vital that Congress act to drive prices down; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the U.S. Congress passes, and the President signs S.1227/H.R.2376, the Prescription Pricing for the People Act of 2019. \n      \n\n\nLS #10924\n6/12/19\nLMS",
