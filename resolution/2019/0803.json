  "Text": "By Council Members Treyger, Rosenthal, Chin and the Public Advocate (Mr. Williams)\n\n      Whereas, Climate change is occurring at an unprecedented rate, and the current trend of warming within Earth's climate system over the last several decades is clear-the atmosphere and ocean have warmed, sea level has risen, and snow and ice levels have decreased; and\n      Whereas, In December 2015, world leaders came together and agreed on a landmark international accord-the Paris Climate Agreement-to combat climate change and to fast-track and strengthen actions towards a low greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions future; and\n      Whereas, Through the Paris Climate Agreement, almost every country in the world committed to work to curb GHG emissions in order to limit the increase in the global average temperature to below 2�C above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5�C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change; and\n      Whereas, In October 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (\"IPCC\") released a special report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5�C above preindustrial levels; and \n      Whereas, The IPCC report found that human activities have already caused an increase in global warming with a likely range of 0.8�C to 1.2�C, and that global warming is likely to reach 1.5�C between 2030 and 2052; and\n       Whereas, According to the IPCC report, if peak temperature globally reaches 2�C some impacts may be long-lasting and irreversible; and\n      Whereas, In November 2018, the United States Fourth National Climate Assessment (\"NCA4\") stressed that the Earth's climate is changing at an alarmingly faster rate than at any time in modern history and this climate change is caused by human activity; and \n      Whereas, The NCA4 projects that the United States will face increased climate instability, annual average temperatures, sea level rise, wild fires, drought, flooding, severe coral bleaching and disruption of ecosystem services, varying across our nations' regions; and \n      Whereas, The NCA4 concurs with the IPCC report that the need for action is urgent; and \n      Whereas, On February 7, 2019, S.Res. 59/H.Res. 109 (\"Resolution\") was introduced, a federal resolution calling for the creation of a Green New Deal (\"GND\"); and\n      Whereas, Among the goals of the GND Resolution is to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and establishing millions of high-wage jobs and ensuring economic security for all; and \n      Whereas, The GND Resolution calls for a 10-year mobilization (\"the mobilization\") that will achieve the GND goals and involve numerous projects; and\n      Whereas, The mobilization would include meeting 100 percent of power demands in the United States through clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy sources; and\n      Whereas, The mobilization would also include transportation investment in zero-emission vehicle infrastructure and manufacturing; clean, affordable, and accessible public transit; and high-speed rail; and\n      Whereas, The mobilization would further include upgrading all existing buildings in the United States and building new buildings to achieve maximum energy efficiency, water efficiency, safety, affordability, comfort, and durability, including through electrification; and\n      Whereas, Additionally, the mobilization would include building or upgrading to energy-efficient, distributed, and \"smart\" power grids, and ensure affordable access to electricity; and \n      Whereas, Moreover, the mobilization would include building resiliency against climate change related disasters through the leverage of funding and provision of investments in community defined adaptation projects and strategies; and \n      Whereas, Achieving the goals and projects proposed in the GND Resolution would help to ensure that the United States is doing the necessary work to mitigate climate change and its impacts on current and future generations; now, therefore, be it\n\tResolved, That the Council of the City of New York supports S.Res. 59/H.Res. 109, a federal resolution calling for the creation a Green New Deal.\n\nNPJ\nLS# 9011\n03/13/2019",
