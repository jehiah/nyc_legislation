  "Text": "By Council Members Salamanca, Brannan and Holden\n      Whereas, Domestic violence (DV) is a pattern of offenses committed by and against members of the same family or household, and individuals who are or have been in an intimate relationship, where the abuser exerts power and control over the victim; and\n      Whereas, Intimate partner violence (IPV), a subset of DV, refers to a pattern of abusive behavior involving victims and offenders who are married, formerly married, have a child in common, or are involved in an intimate relationship to gain or maintain power and control; and\n      Whereas, DV and IPV, which includes economic, emotional, physical and sexual abuse and controlling behaviors, occurs in all settings and among all cultural, religious and socioeconomic groups but primarily affects women and racial and ethnic minorities; and\n      Whereas, DV is a crime in the state of New York, and while overall crime rates have fallen in New York City (NYC) over the past decade, the number of DV homicides has remained steady and DV has assumed a larger percentage of overall crime; and\n      Whereas, Annually, more than 80,000 phone calls are placed to the NYC Domestic Violence Hotline, 1-800-621-HOPE, and the New York Police Department (NYPD) responds to approximately 230,000 DV incidents; and \n      Whereas, NYC Family Justice Centers (FJCs), co-located multidisciplinary service centers operated by the Mayor's Office to End Domestic and Gender-based Violence (ENDGBV), exist in each borough to assist DV survivors with securing emergency shelter and permanent housing, orders of protection, financial aid, health care and filing police reports, as well as to connect them with organizations that provide case management, economic empowerment, counseling, civil legal and criminal legal assistance; and\n      Whereas, Although FJCs provide free and confidential services to all survivors of domestic and gender-based violence and their children regardless of age, sexual orientation, gender identity, language spoken, immigration status, or income, many are either unaware of available support or have concerns that discourage them from accessing services; and\n      Whereas, Decades of research shows that most women experiencing abuse never call the police or go to a shelter, and are more likely to disclose to someone they trust; and\n      Whereas, In 2017, the state of Illinois passed a law to require Barber, Cosmetology, Esthetics, Hair Braiding and Nail Technology licensees to complete one hour of DV and sexual assault awareness education; and\n      Whereas, According to WYCA Evanston/North Shore, the largest provider of comprehensive DV services serving north suburban Cook County in Illinois, salon professionals are in a unique position to recognize the signs and symptoms of DV in their clients and co-workers and directly refer them to supportive services; and\n      Whereas, S.96, sponsored by State Senator Todd Kaminsky, would amend the general business law in relation to ensuring the availability of training for all nail specialty, waxing, natural hair styling, esthetics and cosmetology licensees and those applying for license renewal, as well as a 10 percent reduction in licensing and renewal fees for any applicant who has completed such training; and\n      Whereas, According to the justification for S.96, \"[salon professionals] frequently have a good rapport with their customers, a basis of trust has often been established, and the salon itself can be viewed a safe haven for many victims,\" and \"[t]he regular patronization of salon services is a common denominator among the vast majority of [DV victims]; and\n      Whereas, A.57, sponsored by State Assembly Member Linda Rosenthal, would require DV and sexual assault awareness education for individuals engaged in the practice of nail specialty, waxing, natural hair styling, esthetics and cosmetology and establishes such education programs; and\n      Whereas, Since 2017, after Illinois became the first state to require salon professionals to complete a one-hour awareness and training course about domestic violence and sexual assault in order to renew their two-year license, 14 other states have introduced or passed similar pieces of legislation; and\n      Whereas, Mandatory DV and sexual assault training for salon professionals would expand awareness in the state of New York, as well as add a new opportunity for DV survivors to be connected to counseling services, safe housing and, where warranted, access to protections and criminal justice services; and\n      Whereas, According to the Division of Licensing Services at the Department of State, the majority of fees for initial application and renewal fees for salon professionals is $40, meaning the reduction prescribed by S.96 would only be $4, while a 25 percent, or $10, reduction in licensing and renewal fees for license renewal would encourage more individuals to undergo such education; now, therefore be it\n\tResolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the New York State Legislature to pass and the Governor to sign legislation to requiring domestic violence and sexual assault awareness education for persons engaged in the practice of nail specialty, waxing, natural hair styling, esthetics and cosmetology, and providing a meaningful discount for salon professionals renewing their licenses..\n\n\n\n\n\nLS #9800\n02/15/2019\nCGR\n1",
