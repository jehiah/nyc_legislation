  "Text": "By Council Member Torres \n\n\tWhereas, Born on November 11, 2002, Lesandro Guzman-Feliz was a 15-year-old teenager from the Bronx with a dream of one day becoming a New York City Police Department (NYPD) detective; and \n\tWhereas, The New York City teen, also known as \"Junior\" by friends and family, was a sophomore attending Dr. Richard Izquierdo Health & Science Charter School when he was fatally stabbed multiple times outside of a bodega on East 183rd Street in Belmont in the Bronx on June 20, 2018; and \n\tWhereas, According to prosecutors, the case was one of mistaken identity, as Junior was savagely attacked and stabbed by members the Trinitarios gang because the gang members believed the teen was a member of a rival gang; and  \n\tWhereas, Although mistakenly identified as part of a gang, Junior was far from it, having been a member of the NYPD's Explorers program, a program that provides New York City teens and young adults with an introduction to a career in law enforcement or a related field, and teaches youth the importance of higher education, self-discipline and respect through training and community service projects; and \n      Whereas, In addition, Junior was described by his high school in a statement released, as \"a kind, sweet, respectful young man, always smiling, who had so much potential;\" and \n\tWhereas, The NYPD arrested 14 suspects in relation to Junior's murder, five of whom have been charged with first-degree murder, and nine of whom are accused of taking part in the assault, and whose trials are currently ongoing; and \n\tWhereas, As Junior leaves behind a large number of family and friends, including his mother, Leandra Feliz, and father, Lisandro Guzman, it is important to remember and celebrate his life; and  \n\tWhereas, Thus, in February 2019, a Bronx street located at 183rd Street and Bathgate Avenue in Belmont was renamed to \"Lesandro Junior Guzman-Feliz Way\" in honor of Junior; and\n\tWhereas, A scholarship fund has also been established by the NYPD in memory of Junior to grant two NYPD Explorers with a monetary award to be used for tuition and/or school expenses at an accredited college or academic institution; and  \n\tWhereas, In addition to honoring this young man, it is important to emphasize public policy decisions that help reduce gang violence within the City, as crime, and the social and economic costs it engenders, seriously damage the quality of life in New York City, according to the Citizens Crime Commission of New York City; and  \n\tWhereas, Dedicating a day to remember Junior's life, his innocence, and his dedication to becoming successful and helping others, as well as ensuring that gang violence prevention is emphasized in public policy decisions, would honor his memory and provide his family and friends with relief during this difficult time, as the trials for his murder are ongoing, while also ensuring that incidents like this do not happen again; now, therefore be it  \n\tResolved, That the Council of the City of New York recognizes June 20, 2019 as Lesandro \"Junior\" Guzman-Feliz Day, in an effort to honor his life and encourage gang violence prevention efforts within New York City. \nKK \nLS #11023\n6/5/19",
