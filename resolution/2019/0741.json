Cuomo and the New York State Legislature enacted the Compassionate Care Act legalizing the cultivation, production, distribution, sale, and possession of marijuana for medical use in New York; and\n\tWhereas, In December of 2018, Governor Cuomo announced his full support of statewide legalization of recreational marijuana, making it an administration priority for early 2019; and \n\tWhereas, Ten states, including New York's neighbor Massachusetts, and the District of Columbia have legalized adult use of recreational marijuana; and \n      Whereas, Given the likelihood of New York State legalizing the recreational use of marijuana in the near future, the state should promote equitable ownership and participation in commercial marijuana activity; and \n      Whereas, One way of ensuring such equity would be to give priority to  those with prior marijuana convictions when issuing licenses or permits to engage in the production, sale and distribution of marijuana; and\n      Whereas, Creating such priority system would ensure that ownership and entrepreneurial opportunities are first given to those populations negatively impacted by the decades-old war on drugs, such as low income communities and communities of color; and \n\tWhereas, Additionally, those who receive licenses to sell recreational marijuana should be encouraged to hire individuals who were arrested for and/or convicted of marijuana related offenses, with a particular focus on formerly incarcerated individuals who served time based on marijuana violations, as well as hire locally and provide living wages for individuals employed by marijuana businesses; and \n\tWhereas, In recent years numerous states and municipalities around the country have sought to not only legalize the recreational use of marijuana but also correct the collateral consequences of marijuana-related convictions; now, therefore, be it \n\tResolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the New York State Legislature to introduce and pass and for the Governor to sign legislation that prioritizes individuals with prior marijuana convictions in issuing licenses to sell recreational marijuana and requires other applicants for marijuana licenses to support the hiring of such individuals.\n\n\n\nWJH\n9328 & 9329\n2/1/19",
