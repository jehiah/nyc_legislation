For the purposes hereof, the following terms shall have the following meanings:\n\n(1) \"Company\" shall mean Harlen Housing Preservation LLC or any other entity that acquires the beneficial interest in the Exemption Area with the prior written consent of HPD. \n\n(2) \"Contract Rent Deadline\" shall mean three hundred and sixty-five (365) days from the date of the HPD letter requesting the information that HPD needs to calculate the Contract Rent Differential Tax for the applicable tax year. \n\n(3) \"Contract Rent Differential\" shall mean the amount by which the total contract rents applicable to the Exemption Area for such tax year (as adjusted and established pursuant to Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended) exceed the total contract rents which are authorized as of the Effective Date. \n\n(4) \"Contract Rent Differential Tax\" shall mean the sum of (i) $657,204, plus (ii) twenty-five percent (25%) of the Contract Rent Differential; provided, however, that if the New Owner fails to provide the contract rents on or before the Contract Rent Deadline, Contract Rent Differential Tax shall mean an amount equal to real property taxes that would otherwise be due in such tax year in the absence of any form of exemption from or abatement of real property taxation.\n\n(5) \"Current Owner\" shall mean Harlen Housing Associates, L.P. \n\n(6) \"Effective Date\" shall mean the later of (i) the date of conveyance of the Exemption Area to the HDFC, or (ii) the date that HPD and the New Owner enter into the Regulatory Agreement.\n\n(7) \"Exemption Area\" shall mean the real property located in the Borough of Manhattan, City and State of New York, identified as Block 1736, Lots 1 and 60 on the Tax Map of the City of New York.\n\n(8) \"Expiration Date\" shall mean the earlier to occur of (i) a date which is forty (40) years from the Effective Date, (ii) the date of the expiration or termination of the Regulatory Agreement, or (iii) the date upon which the Exemption Area ceases to be owned by either a housing development fund company or an entity wholly controlled by a housing development fund company.\n\n(9) \"HDFC\" shall mean Harlen Housing Development Fund Corporation or a housing development fund company that acquires the Exemption Area with the prior written consent of HPD.\n\n(10) \"HPD\" shall mean the Department of Housing Preservation and Development of the City of New York.\n\n(11) \"New Exemption\" shall mean the exemption from real property taxation provided hereunder with respect to the Exemption Area.\n\n(12) \"New Owner\" shall mean, collectively, the HDFC and the Company.\n\n(13) \"PHFL\" shall mean the Private Housing Finance Law.\n\n(14) \"Prior Exemption\" shall mean any exemption from real property taxation for the Exemption Area pursuant to Section 125 of the PHFL approved by the Board of Estimate on October 9, 1980 (Cal.

If the noncompliance specified in such notice is not cured within the time period specified therein, the New Exemption shall prospectively terminate.\n\n(2) The New Exemption shall apply to all land in the Exemption Area, but shall only apply to buildings on the Exemption Area that exist on the Effective Date. \n\n(3) Nothing herein shall entitle the HDFC, the New Owner, or any other person or entity to a refund of any real property taxes which accrued and were paid with respect to the Exemption Area prior to the Effective Date.\n\ne.
