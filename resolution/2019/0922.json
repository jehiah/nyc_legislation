Kennedy, in relation to the rate paid by the State to a city for maintenance and repair of highways; and \n      Whereas, A.5990-A/S.4048-A would raise the reimbursement rate for municipalities to $1.87 per square yard of the pavement or road area that is included in the state highway system; and \n      Whereas, A.5990-A/S.4048-A would also raise the payment rate for work pavement areas that are located on elevated bridges from 10 cents to 20 cents per square yard of such pavement area; and \n      Whereas, If A.5990-/S.4048-A were to be enacted, New York City's reimbursement for these maintenance and repair efforts would increase by several million dollars; now, therefore, be it \n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, A.5990-A/S.4048-A, an act to amend the highway law, in relation to the rate paid by the state to a city for maintenance and repair of highways.\n\nLS 10,773\nRA\n5/21/2019\n2",
