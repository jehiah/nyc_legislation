Roger F. Wicker, (R-MS) and H.R.3595, sponsored by Rep. Tim Ryan (D-OH), is bipartisan legislation introduced in both the House and Senate that would require all new passenger vehicles to be equipped with a system to detect the presence of an occupant in a rear seat and engage an auditory and visual warning system after the vehicle engine is deactivated; now, therefore, be it  \n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon Congress to pass, and the President to sign, The Hot Cars Act of 2019 (H.R.3593/S.1601).\nCD\nLS 11,841\n9/9/19",
