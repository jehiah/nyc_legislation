No. 550), a zoning map amendment to eliminate from an R5 district a C1-2 district, change an R5 district to a C4-4 district, and change a C8-1 district to a C4-3A district; C 190366 ZSQ (L.U. No. 552), a special permit to provide relief from regulations governing yard requirements, street wall location, maximum base height, maximum building height and number of stories; C 190375 ZSQ (L.U. No. 553), a special permit to modify surface area requirements for signage; and C 190251 MMQ (L.U. No. 554), a city map amendment to re-establish a portion of former Beach 52nd Street to connect from Rockaway Beach Boulevard to Shore Front Parkway\n      WHEREAS, the Decision is subject to review and action by the Council pursuant to Section 197-d of the City Charter;\n      WHEREAS, upon due notice, the Council held a public hearing on the Decision and Application on October 3, 2019;\n      WHEREAS, the Council has considered the land use implications and other policy issues relating to the Decision and Application; and\n      WHEREAS, the Council has considered the relevant environmental issues, including the positive declaration, issued on March 16, 2018 (CEQR No. 18DCP124Q) and a Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for which a Notice of Completion was issued on September 13, 2019 which identified significant adverse impacts with respect to community facilities (public schools and childcare), active open space, transportation (traffic, transit bus and pedestrians), mobile air quality, and construction activities related to noise and traffic and potential significant adverse impacts related to hazardous materials, stationary air quality and noise would be avoided through the placement of (E) designations (E-532) on the project site .
