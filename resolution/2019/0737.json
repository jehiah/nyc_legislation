  "Text": "By Council Members Cumbo, Ampry-Samuel, Lander, Kallos, Rivera and Ayala\n\n\t Whereas, Legalizing the marketplace for the general adult (non-medical) use of cannabis is a major priority for the New York State legislature; and, \n\tWhereas, The New York City Council supports this policy change particularly because the City's black and brown communities have been disproportionately harmed by the effects of cannabis criminalization; and, \n\tWhereas, Establishing state-wide regulations to ensure consistency with regard to age restrictions, potency levels, and other health and safety concerns is paramount; and, \n\tWhereas, However, New York City should also be empowered to make local licensing laws regarding the adult-use cannabis market, in parallel with the City's current authority over business licensing; and, \n\t Whereas, The City's sheer population size, in addition to the 60 million or so tourists that visit each year, means that the New York City market for the general, non-medical use of cannabis could potentially be the biggest in the State; and, \n\tWhereas, While this presents an enormous business opportunity, the City will want to protect against unintended consequences; and, \n\tWhereas, For example, when ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft came to New York City, they greatly increased travel options for the City's residents; and, \n\tWhereas, While this was a welcomed development for consumers, the services also had negative consequences as the sudden expansion of for-hire vehicles and the increased competition for taxi companies quickly impacted the value of taxi medallions and take-home pay for drivers; and, \n\tWhereas, One of the measures enacted by the City Council in order to mitigate these adverse effects is a cap on the number of licenses for ride-hailing services; and, \n      Whereas, The City has implemented similar restrictions on street vendors, to protect sidewalks from becoming overly congested; and, \n      Whereas, To prevent the concentration of tobacco retailers in particular neighborhoods, the City has also capped the number of tobacco and electronic cigarette retailer licenses according to each community district;

and, \\par\n\\tab Whereas, The New York City Council supports this policy change particularly because the City\\rquote s black and brown communities have been disproportionately harmed by the effects of cannabis criminalization; and, \\par\n\\tab Whereas, Establishing state-wide regulations to ensure consistency with regard to age restrictions, potency levels, and other health and safety concerns is paramount; and, \\par\n\\tab Whereas, However, New York City should also be empowered to make local licensing laws regarding the adult-use cannabis market, in parallel with the City\\rquote s current authority over business licensing; and, \\par\n\\tab  Whereas, The City\\rquote s sheer population size, in addition to the 60 million or so tourists that visit each year, means that the New York City market for the general, non-medical use of cannabis could potentially be the biggest in the State; and, \\par\n\\tab Whereas, While this presents an enormous business opportunity, the City will want to protect against unintended consequences; and, \\par\n\\tab Whereas, For example, when ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft came to New York City, they greatly increased travel options for the City\\rquote s residents; and, \\par\n\\tab Whereas, While this was a welcomed development for consumers, the services also had negative consequences as the sudden expansion of for-hire vehicles and the increased competition for taxi companies quickly impacted the value of taxi medallions and take-home pay for drivers; and, \\par\n\\tab Whereas, One of the measures enacted by the City Council in order to mitigate these adverse effects is a cap on the number of licenses for ride-hailing services; and, \\par\n\\pard\\ltrpar\\fi720\\sl480\\slmult1\\qj Whereas, The City has implemented similar restrictions on street vendors, to protect sidewalks from becoming overly congested;
