Onofre that such laws were unconstitutional; and \n      Whereas, In 1923 the State enacted laws criminalizing loitering with the intent to solicit another man for sex; and \n      Whereas, Despite a successful lawsuit brought against the State in 1983 in which the loitering law was declared unconstitutional, the State continued to enforce it though 2010; and  \n      Whereas, In 1937 Mayor Fiorella H. LaGuardia instituted a policy that required persons convicted of sex crimes - including \"deviate sexual intercourse\" - be under medical observation and committed to Bellevue Hospital if they were found to be insane; and\n      Whereas, Until 2011 New York enforced laws criminalizing a person's dressing \"in a manner to conceal his being identified\" against men and women who wore clothes purportedly designed for the opposite sex; and\n      Whereas, Law enforcement officers carried out such statutes by forcibly investigating individuals' biological sex and mandating that they wear at least three articles of clothing that conformed with said sex; and\n      Whereas, Authorities have used many other laws throughout New York's history directly and indirectly to prosecute and persecute the LGBT community; and\n      Whereas, Arrests and convictions disrupted the lives of LGBT individuals, leading to loss of jobs and careers, ostracization from family and neighbors, and harm to mental health, sadly leading to suicide in some cases; and \n      Whereas, Other countries have rejected their past discrimination against the LGBT community and taken affirmative steps to remedy those injustices; and\n      Whereas, In 2016, for example, Germany pardoned LGBT persons who suffered under Section 175, which criminalized homosexual acts, and, the following year, made reparations to individuals convicted and incarcerated under the law; and\n      Whereas, In 2017 the United Kingdom reckoned with its own history by posthumously offering a royal pardon to men in England and Wales who had been convicted under legislation that outlawed homosexual acts; and\n      Whereas, The United Kingdom issued a specific pardon to Alan Turing, one of the founders of computer science and a hero of World War II, who was arrested for \"gross indecency\" and chemically castrated when it was discovered that Turing was in a same-sex relationship; and\n      Whereas, In 2018 Scotland, following the lead of England, passed similar laws, which pardoned those convicted under prior anti-homosexuality laws and posthumously pardoned those convicted but who have since died; \n      Whereas, In 2018 Canada expunged the records of those criminalized under anti-LGBT laws; and\n      Whereas, New York may only reconcile its relationship with its LGBT populations by acknowledging its past wrongs and offering a legally substantive resolution; now, therefore be it\n      Resolved, That the New York Governor pardon lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals convicted under historical, discriminatory laws.",
