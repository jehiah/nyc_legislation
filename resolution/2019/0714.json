  "Text": "By Council Members Chin, Rosenthal, Vallone, Lander, Eugene, Rose, R. Diaz, Ayala, Rivera and Levin\n\tWhereas, The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), enforced by the United States (U.S.) Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), protects individuals aged 40 and older from age discrimination in the workforce, including discrimination involving promotion, hiring, compensation, discharge, and privileges of employment; and\n\tWhereas, Advocates argue that protections put forth by ADEA were weakened by the 2009 U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc., which requires that plaintiffs seeking to prove age discrimination in the workforce prove that age was the only motivating factor for the employer's action; and\n      Whereas, In 2019, U.S. Senator Robert P. Casey Jr. and Congressman Robert C. Scott introduced S.485 and H.R. 1230, respectively, also known as the Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act (POWADA); and\n      Whereas, POWADA would reverse the Supreme Court's decision in Gross v.
