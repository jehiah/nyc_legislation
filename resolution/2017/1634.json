This action, in conjunction with the related actions would facilitate a new mixed use development on an entire city block with residential, commercial and community facility uses in the East Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan (ULURP No. C 170228 ZSM), Community District 11, Borough of Manhattan (the \"Application\");\n\n      WHEREAS, the Application is related applications C 170226 ZMM (L.U. No. 700), a zoning map amendment to change existing R7-2 and R10A Districts to a C2-8 and an R10 District;  N 170227 ZRM (L.U. No. 701), a zoning text amendment to modify lot coverage requirements and to designate a Mandatory Inclusionary Housing (MIH) area; and C 170229 ZSM (L.U.
