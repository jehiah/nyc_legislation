Zalaquett, Ph.D. and Seria Shia J. Chatters, Ph.D., \"Cyberbullying in College: Frequency, Characteristics, and Practical Implications,\" one in five college students becomes a victim of cyberbullying and harassment; and \n      Whereas, According to a 2012 report by the Human Rights Campaign, lesbian, gay, bi-sexual and transgender students are nearly twice as likely as their peers to experience harassment based on their sexual orientation or gender identity; and \n      Whereas, There is currently no federal requirement that U.S. colleges and universities have policies in place protecting students and employees from cyberbullying or from other forms of harassment based on sexual orientation, or gender identity; and \n      Whereas, H.R. 2151/S.954, known as the Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act (the \"Tyler Clementi Act\"), was reintroduced by U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) and U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (D-WI) to recognize cyberbullying and other forms of harassment via electronic communications as serious issues among college students; and \n      Whereas, The Tyler Clementi Act would require institutions of higher education that receive federal funding to establish policies prohibiting harassment in all forms, including via electronic communications, based on sexual orientation and gender identity as well as religion, race, color, national origin, sex, and disability; and\n      Whereas, These policies would promote campus anti-harassment education, counseling and other resources that could lead to a decrease in cyberbullying and harassment in college communities and possibly save many potential victims' lives; and \n      Whereas, New York City is home to dozens of colleges, universities and institutions of higher learning that would benefit from the mandated policies and heightened awareness about harassment promoted under the Tyler Clementi Act; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the United States Congress to pass and the President to sign H.R. 2151/S.954, the Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act, which would recognize cyberbullying as a form of harassment and require higher education institutions to enact anti-harassment policies protecting students based on sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, race, color, national origin, sex, and disability.\n\n\nLS #9371\n7/12/17\nPLS\n\n      2\n      \n      \n      1",
