The requirements pertain to a number of elements which are interrelated and complement one another but are set forth in different sections because they can be treated separately. Sections 81-42 (Retail Continuity along Designated Streets), 81-43 (Street Wall Continuity along Along Designated Streets) and 81-44 (Curb Cut Restrictions) are a group of sections with closely related purposes concerned with amenity and the well-being and safety of pedestrians. Sections 81-45 to 81-48, inclusive, are all concerned primarily with pedestrian traffic circulation. Major #building# entrances are focal points of heavy pedestrian traffic, so that controls on the locations of these entrances, as set forth in Section 81-48, are closely related to the pedestrian circulation space requirements.\n\nSpecial district plan requirements for the Penn Center Subdistrict are set forth in Section 81-50 (SPECIAL REGULATIONS FOR THE PENN CENTER SUBDISTRICT), for the Grand Central East Midtown Subdistrict are set forth in Section 81-60 (SPECIAL REGULATIONS FOR THE GRAND CENTRAL EAST MIDTOWN SUBDISTRICT), for the Theater Subdistrict are set forth in Section 81-70 (SPECIAL REGULATIONS FOR THEATER SUBDISTRICT), for the Fifth Avenue Subdistrict are set forth in Section 81-80 (SPECIAL REGULATIONS FOR FIFTH AVENUE SUBDISTRICT) and for the Preservation Subdistrict are set forth in Section 81-90 (SPECIAL REGULATIONS FOR PRESERVATION SUBDISTRICT). \n\n*     *     *\n\n81-412\nDirections Directional signs\n\n*     *     *\n\n81-42\nRetail Continuity along Along Designated Streets\n\nFor #buildings developed# or #enlarged# after May 13, 1982, where the ground floor level of such #development# or #enlarged# portion of the #building# fronts upon a designated retail #street# (see Appendix A, Map 2), #uses# within #stories# on the ground floor or with a floor level within five feet of #curb level# shall be limited to retail, personal service or amusement #uses# permitted by the underlying zoning district regulations but not including #uses# in Use Groups 6B, 6E, 7C, 7D, 8C, 8D, 9B, 10B, 11 and 12D or automobile showrooms or plumbing, heating or ventilating equipment showrooms.

The Fund shall be utilized, at the discretion of the #Public Realm Improvement Fund Governing Group#, to provide funding to implement improvements to the East Midtown Subdistrict, and its immediate vicinity, in the Borough of Manhattan. Upon receipt of any contribution, the #Public Realm Improvement Fund Governing Group# or the Department of City Planning shall notify the Comptroller and the Speaker and promptly deposit it into the Fund.\n\n\nPublic Realm Improvement Fund Development Rights Valuation \n\nFor the purposes of Section 81-60, inclusive, the \"Public Realm Improvement Fund Development Rights Valuation\" (\"Development Rights Valuation\") shall be a value per square foot of transferable development rights in the East Midtown Subdistrict, which shall provide a basis for establishing a minimum contribution to the #Public Realm Improvement Fund#.

allow enlargements on qualifying sites\n\nIn conjunction with any application that would allow additional #floor area# permitted beyond the basic maximum #floor area# for a #qualifying site# set forth in Section 81-64 (Special Floor Area Provisions for Qualifying Sites), the City Planning Commission may authorize modifications to the requirement in the definition of #qualifying site# in Section 81-613 that the additional #floor area# permitted through the provisions of Section 81-64 be achieved exclusively through a #development#, and may to allow #enlargements# on #qualifying sites# to an existing #building# with a frontage along a #wide street#. The Commission may also waive the requirement that such #qualifying site# provide publicly accessible space in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b) of Section 81-681 (Mandatory requirements for qualifying sites). In order to permit such modifications, provided that the Commission shall finds that such #enlargement# includes significant renovations to the existing #building# that will bring it up to contemporary space standards.\n\nWhere the existing #building# includes #non-complying floor area#, a contribution shall be deposited by the applicant into the #Public Realm Improvement Fund#. Such contribution shall be an amount equal to 20 percent of the #Public Realm Improvement Fund Development Rights Valuation# multiplied by the amount of such pre-existing #non-complying floor area#. For the purposes of such calculation, the amount of existing #non-complying floor area# shall not include any bonus #floor area# associated with a #publicly accessible open area# to remain on the #zoning lot#. The payment of the non-refundable contribution to the #Public Realm Improvement Fund#, shall be a precondition to the issuance of any foundation permit or new building permit by the Department of Buildings allowing the #enlargement# on a #qualifying site#.  \n\nFor such #enlargements# to #buildings# with #non-complying floor area#, the proposed #floor area# beyond the amount contained in the pre-existing #non-complying building# shall be obtained by utilizing the applicable provisions of Section 81-64 (Special Floor Area Provisions for Qualifying Sites). For the purposes of applying the provisions of such Section, the reconstructed #floor area ratio# shall be considered the basic maximum #floor area ratio#. However, the maximum #floor area ratios# of Row E and Row H shall continue to apply. \n\nHowever, an alternation of an existing #building# resulting in both the removal of more than 75 percent of the #floor area# and more than 25 percent of the perimeter walls of such existing #building#, and the replacement of any amount of #floor area#, shall be considered a #development#.\n\nApplications for authorizations shall be referred to the affected Community Board for a period of at least 30 days for comment. The City Planning Commission shall grant in whole or in part or deny the application within 60 days of the completion of the Community Board review period.\n\nThe Commission may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards to minimize adverse effects on the character of the surrounding area.\n\n(b) Authorization for a qualifying site providing publicly accessible space\n\nIn conjunction with any application that would allow additional #floor area# permitted beyond the basic maximum #floor area# on a #qualifying site# set forth in Section 81-64 (Special Floor Area Provisions for Qualifying Sites) and providing publicly accessible space, open or enclosed, pursuant to paragraph (b) of Section 81-681 (Mandatory requirements for qualifying sites), the City Planning Commission may authorize the waiver of the #street wall# regulations of Sections 81-43 (Street Wall Continuity Along Designated Retail Streets) and 81-671 (Special street wall requirements), requirements of Sections 81-42 (Retail Continuity Along Designated Streets) and 81-674 (Ground floor use provisions), the curb cut location restriction of paragraph (b) of Section 81-675 (Curb cut restrictions and loading berth requirements), and the design requirements for publicly accessible space, open or enclosed, set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of Section 81-681.\n\nIn order to grant such authorization, the Commission shall find that such proposed waivers will result in a superior urban design relationship with surrounding #streets#, #buildings#, and other open areas, and;\n\n(1) for waiver of #street wall# regulations:\n\n(i) such waiver is necessary due to constraints or conditions of the configuration of the site; and\n\n(ii) such waiver will not unduly obstruct the access to light and air of surrounding #buildings# and open spaces; \n\n(2) for waivers of retail continuity and ground floor #use# provisions, such waivers are minimized by a site plan that requires pedestrian-oriented #uses# along the boundaries of any publicly accessible space, open or enclosed;\n\n(3) for waiver of  the curb cut location restriction of paragraph (b) of Section 81-675, for a #qualifying site# on 47th Street between Park Avenue and Vanderbilt Avenue, that the proposed curb cut location will not unduly interrupt the flow of pedestrian traffic or result in any undue conflict between pedestrian and vehicular movement; and  \n\n(4) for modifications of the design requirements for a publicly accessible space, open or enclosed:\n\n(i) the publicly accessible space and proposed # building# on the #qualifying site# are designed in a manner that results in a cohesive and harmonious site plan, \n\n(ii) the publicly accessible space is superior in design and quality of amenities;\n\n(iii) the publicly accessible space provides connections to pedestrian circulation spaces in the immediate vicinity; \n\n(iv) the pedestrian network of the surrounding area is enhanced by the publicly accessible space; and\n\n(v) such waiver is the minimum waiver necessary to afford relief. \n\nNo modifications to the required amount of publicly accessible space set forth in paragraph (b) of Section 81-681 shall be permitted. \n\nAll applications pursuant to this Section shall be referred to the affected Community Board, the local Council Member, and the Borough President of Manhattan. No authorization shall be granted prior to sixty days after such referral.\n\nThe Commission may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards to minimize adverse effects on the character of the surrounding area.\n\n\n81-685\nSpecial permit to modify qualifying site provisions\n\nIn conjunction with any application that would allow additional #floor area# permitted beyond the basic maximum #floor area# for a #qualifying site# set forth in Section 81-64 (Special Floor Area Provisions for Qualifying Sites), the City Planning Commission may permit modifications to certain #qualifying site# criteria, as well as height and setback regulations and mandatory plan elements, as set forth in paragraph (a) of this Section, provided that the Commission determines that the application requirements set forth in paragraph (b) and the findings set forth in paragraph (c) of this Section are met.\n\n(a) The Commission may modify the following, whether singly or in any combination:\n\n(1) the following #qualifying site# criteria:\n\n(i) the requirement for minimum #wide street# frontage, including the requirement that no existing #buildings# will remain on such #wide street# frontage, set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of the definition of a #qualifying site# in Section 81-613 (Definitions);\n\n(ii) the #building# performance and publicly accessible space requirements in the paragraph (f) of the definition of a #qualifying site# and Section 81-681 (Building energy design  requirements for qualifying sites)(Mandatory requirements for qualifying sites); or\n\n(iii) the requirement that the additional #floor area# permitted through the provisions of Section 81-64 be achieved exclusively through a #development#;\n\n(2) the provisions for #zoning lots# divided by district boundaries set forth in Sections 77-02 (Zoning Lots no Existing Prior to Effective Date or Amendment of Resolution), 77-21 (General Provisions) or 77-22 (Floor Area Ratio), and the provisions of Section 81-612 (Applicability along district boundaries) requiring that #zoning lots# divided by Subarea boundaries utilize the provisions of Article VII, Chapter 7;\n\n(3) the #street wall# regulations of Sections 81-43 (Street Wall Continuity Along Designated Streets) or 81-671 (Special street wall requirements), inclusive; \n\n(4) the height and setback regulations of Sections 81-26 (Height and Setback Regulations - Daylight Compensation), inclusive, 81-27 (Alternate Height and Setback Regulations -Daylight Evaluation), inclusive, or 81-66 (Special Height and Setback Requirements); or\n\n(5) the mandatory district plan elements of Sections 81-42 (Retail Continuity Along Designated Streets), 81-44 (Curb Cut Restrictions), 81-45 (Pedestrian Circulation Space), 81-46 (Off-street Relocation or Renovation of a Subway Stair), 81-47 (Major Building Entrances), 81-48 (Off-street Improvement of Access to Rail Mass Transit Facility), 81-674 (Ground floor use provisions), 81-675  (Curb cut restrictions and loading berth requirements), 81-676 (Pedestrian circulation space requirements) or 37-50 (REQUIREMENTS FOR PEDESTRIAN CIRCULATION SPACE), inclusive, except that no modifications to the required amount of pedestrian circulation space set forth in Section 37-51 shall be permitted.\n\n(b) Application requirements\n\nApplications for a special permit for modifications pursuant to this Section shall contain materials, of sufficient scope and detail, to enable the Commission to determine the extent of the proposed modifications. In addition, where modifications to #street wall# or height and setback regulations are proposed, any application shall contain the following materials, at a minimum:\n\n(1) drawings, including but not limited to, plan views and axonometric views, that illustrate how the proposed #building# will not comply with the #street wall# regulations of Section 81-43 (Street Wall Continuity Along Designated Streets), or as such provisions are modified pursuant to Section 81-671 (Special street wall requirements), as applicable, and that illustrate how the proposed #building# will not comply with the height and setback regulations of Sections 81-26 (Height and Setback Regulations - Daylight Compensation) or 81-27 (Alternate Height and Setback Regulations - Daylight Evaluation), or as such provisions are modified pursuant to Section 81-66 (Special Height and Setback Requirements), as applicable;\n\n(2) where applicable, formulas showing the degree to which such proposed #building# will not comply with the length and height rules of Section 81-26, or as such provisions are modified pursuant to Section 81-66; and\n\n(3) where applicable, #daylight evaluation charts# and the resulting daylight evaluation score showing the degree to which such proposed #building# will not comply with the provisions of Section 81-27 or as such provisions are modified pursuant to Section 81-66.\n\n(c) Findings\n\n       The Commission shall find that such proposed modifications:\n\n(1) to the definition of #qualifying site# are the minimum extent necessary, and are harmonious with the Subdistrict objective to protect and strengthen the economic vitality and competitiveness of East Midtown by facilitating the development of exceptional modern and sustainable office towers;\n\n(2) to the requirement for #wide street# frontage in the definition of #qualifying sites# will not unduly concentrate #bulk# towards the middle of the #block# to the detriment of the surrounding area;
