  "Text": "By The Speaker (Council Member Mark-Viverito) and Council Members Gibson, Menchaca, Kallos and Williams\n\n      Whereas, A permit to carry a concealed handgun allows an individual to carry his or her handgun outside of his or her home or place of business; and\n      Whereas, Both New York State and New York City have instituted stringent procedures governing the lawful possession and carrying of a handgun; and \n      Whereas, In New York State, in order to purchase a handgun an individual must first obtain a license to carry or possess a handgun; and\n      Whereas, The application process entails meeting strict eligibility requirements and a finding of there being no good cause to deny the license, including: (i) the person is of good moral character, (ii) older than 21 years old, (iii) never convicted of a felony, or serious offense, (iv) not a fugitive from justice, (v) not an unlawful or addicted user of any controlled substance, (vi) not an undocumented immigrant or admitted under a nonimmigrant visa, (vii) has not been dishonorably discharged from the Armed Forces, (viii) has not renounced his or her United States citizenship, (ix) stating if he or she has ever suffered any mental illness or been  confined  to any hospital or institution, public or private, for mental illness, and (x) having had a license revoked, suspended, or declared ineligible under state law, (xi) had a legal guardian appointed due to mental incapacity or lacks the mental capacity to manage his or her own affairs; and\n      Whereas, New York State has given the New York City Police Commissioner the authority to grant and issue licenses to carry firearms in New York City; and\n      Whereas, The Licensing Division of the New York City Police Department (\"NYPD\") rigorously screens each applicant prior to granting a license; and\n      Whereas, The NYPD's Licensing Division requires an in-person interview, tax returns, and performs a thorough background check which includes the inspection of sealed criminal records; and\n      Whereas, Applicants can be denied because they have a history of driving under the influence of alcohol, have unpaid traffic tickets, or simply because they were uncooperative during the application process; and \n      Whereas, New York City does not recognize out-of-city permits; and\n      Whereas, A New York State permit is valid throughout the State except in New York City where such individual needs to obtain a special permit to validate such permit from the NYPD; and\n      Whereas, Although New York State and City possess these safeguards, there is a bill pending in Congress that would undermine New York's efforts; and\n                     Whereas, Representative Richard Hudson introduced H.R.38, known as the \"Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017\"; and \n      Whereas, Senator John Cornyn introduced S.446, known as the \"Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017\"; and\n      Whereas, H.R.38/S.446 would amend the United States Code to authorize an individual who is not prohibited from possessing, transporting, shipping, or receiving a firearm under federal law, who is carrying a valid identification document containing a photograph of the person, and who is carrying a valid license or permit which is issued pursuant to the law of the State and which permits the person to carry a concealed firearm or is entitled to carry a concealed firearm in the State in which the person resides, to possess or carry a concealed handgun in any State and be exempt from the federal prohibition on possessing a firearm in a school zone, and to carry or possess a concealed handgun on federally owned lands that are open to the public; and \n      Whereas, H.R.38/S.446 would permit an individual to carry and conceal a handgun in New York State even if the license he or she holds is from another state with less stringent licensing standards;
