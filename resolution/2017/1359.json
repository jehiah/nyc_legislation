  "Text": "By Council Member Ferreras-Copeland\n\n       WHEREAS, The New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development (\"HPD\") submitted to the Council of the City of New York its request dated January 26, 2017 that the Council of the City of New York approve an additional exemption from real property taxes for the properties located at 212-226 9th Avenue (Block 747, Lot 1), 311-351 West 24th Street (Block 748, Lot 1), 250-268 9th Avenue (Block 749, Lot 1), 313 8th Avenue (Block 749, Lot 24), 270-296 9th Avenue (Block 751, Lot 1) and 305 9th Avenue (Block 752, Lot 1) in Manhattan (\"Exemption Area\"), pursuant to Section 125(1)(a-4) of the Private Housing Finance Law; and\n      \n      WHEREAS, The State Legislature, by enactment of Chapter 531 of the Laws of 2014, which added Section 125(1)(a-4) of the Private Housing Finance Law (\"Article V Mutual Authorizing Legislation\"), has authorized the local legislative body in a city having a population of one million or more to grant an additional tax exemption for a period of up to fifty years to a mutual redevelopment company for which the local legislative body has previously acted to extend the tax exemption for the maximum period provided  for Section 125(1)(a-2) of the Private Housing Finance Law; and \n      \n      WHEREAS, Such Article V Mutual Authorizing Legislation also provides that such grant of an additional tax exemption period shall take effect upon the expiration of the maximum period provided for in Section 125(1)(a-2) of the Private Housing Finance Law; and \n      \n      WHEREAS, Such Article V Mutual Authorizing Legislation also provides  that the amount of taxes to be paid by such mutual redevelopment company during any such period of tax exemption shall be not less than an amount equal to the greater of (i) ten per centum of the annual rent or carrying charges of the project minus utilities for the residential portion of the project, or (ii) the taxes payable by such company for the residential portion of the project during the tax year commencing July 1, 2000 and ending on June 30, 2001; and\n      \n      WHEREAS, the Council of the City of New York, the local legislative body of the City of New York, has previously acted, pursuant to Res. No. 2044 of 2001, to extend the tax exemption for properties owned and operated by Mutual Redevelopment Houses, Inc. (\"Housing Company\") and located in the Exemption Area, pursuant to Section 125(1)(a-2) of the Private Housing Finance Law,  for the maximum period provided in Section 125(1)(a-2) of the Private Housing Finance Law; and\n      \n      WHEREAS, Such tax exemption pursuant to Section 125(1)(a-2) of the Private Housing Finance Law shall expire on June 30, 2022; and\n      \n      WHEREAS, The City of New York, acting through the HPD Commissioner, (\"City\") entered into an agreement with the Housing Company, dated as of June 24, 2011 (\"Sixth Amendatory Agreement\"), which Sixth Amendatory Agreement was approved by the City Council on May 6, 2011 (Res. No. 813 of 2011); and \n      \n\tWHEREAS, In Section 1 of such Sixth Amendatory Agreement, the City and the Housing Company agreed to amend Paragraph 105 of that certain Agreement, dated as of July 1, 1987, between the Housing Company and the City, as amended by an Amendatory Agreement dated as of November, 1990, and further amended by a Second Amendatory Agreement dated as of July 1, 1995, and by a Third Amendatory Agreement dated as of August 22, 2001, and by a Fourth Amendatory Agreement dated as of October 6, 2005, and by a Fifth Amendatory Agreement dated as of January 17, 2006 (collectively, including the Sixth Amendatory Agreement,  \"City Agreement\"), to add a new subparagraph (B) to Paragraph 105 of the City Agreement, to provide, among other things, that, subject to the enactment of the Article V Mutual Authorizing Legislation and the enactment of a resolution by the City Council:\n\n\t\t\"... the City agrees to and hereby does grant an additional exemption and exempts from local and municipal taxes, all of the value of the portion of the Redevelopment Project owned by the Housing Company  which is taxed as residential pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, for the period commencing with the City's tax year July 1, 2022 through June 30, 2023, and continuing through the City's tax year July 1, 2029 through June 30, 2030, provided that the amount of taxes to be paid by the Housing Company during each such tax year shall be an amount equal to the greater of (i) ten per centum of the annual rent or carrying charges of the Housing Company minus utilities for the residential portion of the Redevelopment Project or (ii) the taxes paid by the Housing Company for the residential portion of the Redevelopment Project in the City's tax year July 1, 2000 through June 30, 2001, in the total amount of $3,477,099.00 (the 'Additional Exemption') ...\" ;  \nand  \n      \n      WHEREAS, The Article V Mutual Authorizing Legislation has been enacted by the State Legislature; and\n      \n      WHEREAS, The Council of the City of New York has determined that, given the tremendous growth in real property values in the Exemption Area, which has caused real property taxes to increase beyond the means of the primarily low- and moderate-income tenants who reside therein, it is in the interest of the City to assist the Housing Company in maintaining affordable rents and carrying charges by granting an additional exemption as authorized by Section 125(1)(a-4) of the Private Housing Finance Law; and\n \n      WHEREAS, The Council of the City of New York has considered the financial implications relating to the extended partial exemption from real property taxes; and \n      \n      WHEREAS, The Council, acted, pursuant to Res. No. 658 of 2015, to approve a Seventh Amendatory Agreement between the Housing Company and the City, executed by the parties on May 8, 2015, which in part provided,  \"... pursuant to Private Housing Finance Law �125(1)(a-4), [of] an additional exemption from real property taxes, other than assessments for local improvements, of all of the residential portion of the Exemption Area for a period commencing with the City's tax year July 1, 2022 through June 30, 2023 and continuing through the City's tax year July 1, 2029 through June 30, 2030, provided, however, that the amount of taxes to be paid during such period of tax exemption shall not be less than an amount equal to the greater of (i) ten per centum of the annual rent or carrying charges of the project minus the utilities for the residential portion of the project, or (ii) $3,477,099.00, the taxes payable by the Housing Company for the residential portion of the project during the tax year commencing July 1, 2000 and ending on June 30, 2001.\"; and\n\n      WHEREAS, While Chapter 531 of the Laws of 2015 authorized an additional tax exemption for a total of fifty years, the Housing Company only sought and received from the Council in 2015 an extension of eight years, to June 30, 2030.  However, the Housing Company is now eligible for a 35-year loan of approximately $190,000,000 (the \"Loan\") to be insured by the Federal Housing Administration of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Renewal (\"HUD\").  The Loan, which is expected to close in 2017, will enable Penn South to remain affordable throughout its 35-year term; and \n      \n      WHEREAS, As conditions for providing the Loan, HUD will require the Housing Company to secure another extension of its tax exemption for an additional 22 years until June 30, 2052.  HUD also will require the Housing Company to secure the authority to impose, at its discretion and without any further City Council approvals, carrying charge increases at the rate of one (1%) percent per year throughout the term of the Loan until 2052 (\"1% Carrying Charge Increases\").  These 1% Carrying Charge Increases would be in addition to any other increases previously or hereafter authorized by the Council.  Finally, HUD will require the discretionary authority to mandate from time to time and without any further City Council approvals, that the Housing Company increase its carrying charges if necessary for purposes of paying expenses.  All of these requirements also will necessitate amendments to the City Agreement; and\n      \n      WHEREAS, Pursuant to Paragraph 206 of the City Agreement, the Housing Company currently shares with the City a portion of the surcharges collected from certain tenant-cooperators pursuant to Paragraphs 204 and 205 of the City Agreement.  The Housing Company is also requesting an amendment to the City Agreement that will authorize its retention of the entire amount of such surcharges, commencing with those surcharges due from tenant cooperators based on their incomes for calendar year 2017. The Housing Company will use such funds to support its operations, maintenance and/or reserves for future capital projects in order to maintain the livable and affordable nature of the housing development; and\n      \n      WHEREAS, HPD, which supervises the Housing Company, recognizes the importance of the preservation of the Exemption Area as an affordable housing development and the tax relief necessary for such preservation. HPD also supports the proposed Eighth Amendatory Agreement; now, therefore, be it\n      \n      RESOLVED:\n \n           The Council of the City of New York hereby: \n\n1. Approves, pursuant to PHFL � 125(1)(a-4), an additional exemption from real property taxes, other than assessments for local improvements, of all of the residential portion of the Exemption Area for the period commencing with the City's tax year July 1, 2030 through June 30, 2031 and continuing through the City's tax year July 1, 2051 through June 30, 2052, provided, however, that the amount of taxes to be paid during such period of tax exemption shall not be less than an amount equal to the greater of (i) ten per centum of the annual rent or carrying charges of the project minus the utilities for the residential portion of the project, or (ii) $3,477,099.00, the taxes payable by the Housing Company for the residential portion of the project during the tax year commencing July 1, 2000 and ending on June 30, 2001.\n\n2.

Paragraph 206 of the City Agreement is hereby amended as follows: \n         a.  \tParagraph 206 is renumbered as \"Paragraph 206A\", and the following is inserted as the introductory text to subparagraph (a) of such renumbered paragraph:\n\t\"The provisions of this Paragraph 206A apply during the term of the Agreement solely to surcharges due and payable by tenant cooperators to the Housing Company before July 1, 2018.\"\n         b.

However, the Housing Company is now eligible for a 35-year loan of approximately $190,000,000 (the \\ldblquote Loan\\rdblquote ) to be insured by the Federal Housing Administration of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Renewal (\\ldblquote HUD\\rdblquote ).  The Loan, which is expected to close in 2017, will enable Penn South to remain affordable throughout its 35-year term; and \\par\n\\par\n\\b WHEREAS\\b0 , As conditions for providing the Loan, HUD will require the Housing Company to secure another extension of its tax exemption for an additional 22 years until June 30, 2052.

These 1% Carrying Charge Increases would be in addition to any other increases previously or hereafter authorized by the Council.  Finally, HUD will require the discretionary authority to mandate from time to time and without any further City Council approvals, that the Housing Company increase its carrying charges if necessary for purposes of paying expenses.  All of these requirements also will necessitate amendments to the City Agreement; and\\par\n\\par\n\\b WHEREAS\\b0 , Pursuant to Paragraph 206 of the City Agreement, the Housing Company currently shares with the City a portion of the surcharges collected from certain tenant-cooperators pursuant to Paragraphs 204 and 205 of the City Agreement.  The Housing Company is also requesting an amendment to the City Agreement that will authorize its retention of the entire amount of such surcharges, commencing with those surcharges due from tenant cooperators based on their incomes for calendar year 2017. The Housing Company will use such funds to support its operations, maintenance and/or reserves for future capital projects in order to maintain the livable and affordable nature of the housing development; and\\par\n\\par\n\\b WHEREAS, \\b0 HPD, which supervises the Housing Company, recognizes the importance of the preservation of the Exemption Area as an affordable housing development and the tax relief necessary for such preservation.
