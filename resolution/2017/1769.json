Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary:\na) The New Exemption shall terminate if HPD determines at any time that (i) the Exemption Area is not being operated in accordance with the requirements of Article XI of the Private Housing Finance Law, (ii) the Exemption Area is not being operated in accordance with the requirements of the Regulatory Agreement, (iii) the Exemption Area is not being operated in accordance with the requirements of any other agreement with, or for the benefit of, the City of New York, (iv) any interest in the Exemption Area is conveyed or transferred to a new owner without the prior written approval of HPD, or (v) the construction or  demolition of any private or multiple dwelling on the Exemption Area has commenced without the prior written consent of HPD.  HPD shall deliver written notice of any such determination to the New Owner and all mortgagees of record, which notice shall provide for an opportunity to cure of not less than sixty (60) days.  If the noncompliance specified in such notice is not cured within the time period specified therein, the New Exemption shall prospectively terminate.\nb) The New Exemption shall apply to all land in the Exemption Area, but shall only apply to a building on the Exemption Area that exists on the Effective Date.\nc) Nothing herein shall entitle the HDFC, the New Owner or any past owner to a refund of any real property taxes which accrued and were paid with respect to the Exemption Area prior to the Effective Date.\nd) All previous resolutions, if any, providing an exemption from or abatement of real property taxation with respect to the Exemption Area are hereby revoked as of the Effective Date.\n6. In consideration of the New Exemption, the owner of the Exemption Area shall, for so long as the New Exemption shall remain in effect, waive the benefits of any additional or concurrent real property tax abatement and/or tax exemption which may be authorized under any existing or future local, state or federal law, rule or regulation.\nAdopted.\n\n   \tOffice of the City Clerk, }\n   \tThe City of New York,  } ss.:\n\n  \t  \tI hereby certify that the foregoing is a true copy of a Resolution passed by The Council of The City of New York on December 19, 2017, on file in this office.\n\n\n  \t   \t\n\t\t\t\t       \t       ........................................\n  \t   \t       \t       \t       \t     \t\t\tCity Clerk, Clerk of The Council\n\n\nPage 4 of 4\n20185129 HAX\nRes.
