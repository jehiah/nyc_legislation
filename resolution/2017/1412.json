Bill of Rights, which provided returning soldiers with benefits such as college scholarships and zero down payments for home loans; and \n\tWhereas, More than 2.5 million veterans served in Iraq and Afghanistan, and many of them saw multiple deployments; and \n\tWhereas, As these individuals come home and reintegrate into civilian life, it is incumbent upon our elected civilian leaders to honor and pay tribute to these individuals whenever and wherever possible; and\n\tWhereas, As a city that nearly 200,000 veterans call home, and a place of unique cultural, economic, and symbolic importance, New York City strives to acknowledge the contributions of our nation's veterans; now, therefore, be it \n\t Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York declares June 22nd New York City Veterans Tribute and Advocacy Day \n\nLS#10306 \n3/10/2017\nMK",
