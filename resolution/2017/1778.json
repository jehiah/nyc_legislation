  "Text": "By Council Member Cabrera\n \n\tWhereas, In wake of violent incidents, such as shootings and stabbings, security at airports has become a growing national concern; and \n\tWhereas, According to various reports, on January 7, 2017 a man went on a shooting rampage with a handgun he packed in a checked bag at Fort Lauderdale International Airport, killing five people and injuring six; and \n\tWhereas, In response to a violent machete attack at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport in 2015, where a Transit Security Administration (TSA) agent was injured, the American Federation of Government Employees called for the creation of a force within the TSA that would be armed and authorized to use deadly force at airports across the nation; and \n\tWhereas, While TSA agents are on the frontlines of airport security, they are currently banned from carrying weapons; and \n\tWhereas, According to J. David Cox, the president of the union that represents TSA employees, airports around the nation rely too heavily on local police departments to react to, detain, and arrest suspects; and \n\t Whereas, TSA employees are often the first  enforcement officials passengers come into contact with at airports, making them especially vulnerable; and \n\tWhereas, According to various reports, in November of 2013, a TSA officer was shot and killed by an armed suspect who ran through a security checkpoint in Los Angeles and terrorized passengers before being arrested and charged by the Los Angeles Airport Police; and \n\tWhereas, Experts have warned that areas of the airport that are open to the general public are potential targets, since there are no obvious security barriers; and\n\tWhereas, In August 2016 thousands of uniformed commuters in two terminals hid behind pillars and under seats after someone reported hearing gun shots at John F. Kennedy Airport; and \n\tWhereas, Although there was not a gunman, the Port Authority Police Department found that the airport lacked communication with the public, and lacked resources and officers to handle the situation if there was an active shooter involved; and\n\tWhereas, While airport security after the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks have primarily focused on preventing airborne attacks, maintaining the safety of passengers and the public, as well as airport staff, is vital; and \n\tWhereas, Developing a special armed unit within the TSA, trained to handle volatile situations, could streamline security and make for a more efficient response to violent incidents; now, therefore, be it \n\tResolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the federal government to create a division of the Transit Security Administration authorized to carry firearms\n\n\nLS #10034/10020\n4/7/17\nCMA",
