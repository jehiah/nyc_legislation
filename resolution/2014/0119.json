Rosenthal and Senator Kenneth P. LaValle, would address this public concern by requiring genetically modified foods and foods made using genetically modified materials to be labeled as such; and\n\tWhereas, Under A.3525-A/S.3835-A, processed food containing less than nine-tenths of one percent of genetically modified materials would not need to provide such labeling, nor would the law apply to animals that ingest any genetically modified food or drugs, prepared food intended for immediate consumption, alcoholic beverages, medical food, food lawfully certified as \"organic,\" processed food produced with the genetically engineered processing aids and enzymes, and food unintentionally produced with genetically modified material materials; and\n\tWhereas, Failure to comply with the labeling requirements mandated by A.3525-A/S.3835-A could result in a misdemeanor charge; and\n\tWhereas, Greater disclosure is a necessary ingredient for effective consumer protection; now, therefore, be it\n\tResolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the New York State legislature to pass and the Governor to sign A.3525-A/S.3835-A, which would require the labeling of food or food products that contain genetically modified material or were produced using genetically modified material.\n\nDMB/CP\nLS# 355\n2/10/14",
