Klein announced \"Affordable New York\" (a/k/a Affordable NY), the New York State Senate Independent Democratic Conference's 2014 legislative agenda; and\n      Whereas, Affordable NY seeks to make New York more affordable for working families in New York City and across the State of New York by increasing access to vital services and lowering the cost of living; and\n      Whereas, As part of the Affordable NY legislative agenda, Senator Klein has proposed that New York workers be guaranteed six weeks of paid maternity and family leave, allowing workers to care for newborn children or sick relatives; and\n      Whereas, States such as New Jersey and California currently guarantee their workers similar allotments of paid family leave, while New York State offers unpaid leave and Temporary Disability Insurance, which guarantees workers only $170 per week; and\n      Whereas, Affordable NY calls for paid maternity and family leave benefits to be expanded to $450 per week immediately, and to increase to a maximum of $700 per week in 2015; and\n      Whereas, Extending paid maternity and family benefits would allow workers to care for newborn children or ailing loved ones, without the threat of losing their jobs or experiencing significant financial hardship; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York supports State Senator Jeffrey Klein's \"Affordable New York\" plan and its provisions to require that workers be allotted six weeks of paid maternity and family leave.\n\nLS #5261/session 9\nPD\n1-9-14",
