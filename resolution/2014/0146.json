  "Text": "By Council Members Vallone and Koo\n\n      Whereas, There has been a longstanding debate between Japan and Korea regarding the name of the body of water located between the Japanese archipelago and the Korean peninsula; and\n      Whereas, Japan refers to that body of water as the \"Sea of Japan,\" while Korea recognizes it as the \"East Sea\"; and\n      Whereas, Whereas, According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan, the name Sea of Japan had been geographically and historically established since the late 18th  to early 19th century and is currently used in most countries all over the world; and\n      Whereas, The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan also stated that more than 97% of maps used throughout the world display the name Sea of Japan; and \n      Whereas, Korean advocates argue that the name Sea of Japan was standardized worldwide while Korea was under Japanese colonial rule, after the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) published its definitive \"Limits of the Oceans and the Seas\" in 1929, according to Reuters; and\n      Whereas, In response to the name dispute, the National Geographic Society in Washington, DC, began including the term East Sea in parentheses following any reference to the Sea of Japan in its maps in 1999; and\n      Whereas, On February 6, 2014, the Virginia State Legislature passed a bill that requires all new textbooks to also refer to the Sea of Japan as the East Sea, which is  expected to be signed into law by Governor Terry McAuliffe; and\n      Whereas, Similar legislation is currently being considered in the states of New Jersey and New York; and\n      Whereas, According to U.S. News and World Report, a bill was recently  introduced in New Jersey that would require the body of water to be called the East Sea for all governmental purposes, although it does not require the term to be used in school textbooks; and\n      Whereas, In New York, S.6570, sponsored by State Senator Stavisky, and A.8742, sponsored by Assembly Member Braunstein, would amend the Education Law, requiring all textbooks in the State to reference the Sea of Japan as also the East Sea; and\n      Whereas, This bill would align New York's textbooks with a growing, international movement to recognize both names as acceptable; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the New York State Legislature to pass and the Governor to sign S.6570/A.8742, requiring all textbooks to also refer to the Sea of Japan as the East Sea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLS 669 & 750\n3/13/14\n2:00 p.m.\nTC\n2",
