Johnson's \"Great Society\" package of reforms; and\n      Whereas, The goal of the Older Americans Act is to provide funding and resources for nutrition, housing and community services for America's senior citizen population; and\n\tWhereas, According to the United States Administration on Aging, the Older Americans Act \"is considered to be the major vehicle for the organization and delivery of social and nutrition services\" for older Americans; and\n\tWhereas, Since its initial passage in 1965, the Older Americans Act has historically been reauthorized by Congress each time it has been set to expire; and\n\tWhereas, However, after the last reauthorizing Act in 2006, which extended the law for five years, Congress failed to reauthorize in 2011, allowing the Older Americans Act to expire; and\n      Whereas, While Congress has continued to fund certain Older Americans Act programs through other appropriations on a yearly basis since 2011, senior advocates claim that failing to reauthorize the Act threatens the future of programs which provide vital resources such as Meals on Wheels, senior centers and senior job training; and\n\tWhereas, Without these services, many seniors in New York City and across the country will likely struggle to maintain their previous quality of life, and may face increased health, economic and social challenges; and\n\tWhereas, The Older Americans Act Reauthorization of 2014, H.R. 3850 and S. 1562, sponsored by Representative Christopher Gibson and Senator Bernie Sanders, respectively, would amend the Older Americans Act to authorize appropriations from 2014 through 2018; and\n\tWhereas, H.R. 3850 and S. 1562 would ensure funding for many vital programs and services for senior citizens through 2018; now, therefore, be it\n\tResolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the United States Congress to pass, and the President to sign, a reauthorization of the Older Americans Act, ensuring the continuation of vital services for seniors.\nPD\nLS#488\n1/29/14",
