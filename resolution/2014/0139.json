Golden, and A.1533, sponsored by Assembly Member Steven Cymbrowitz, would increase all penalties for leaving the scene of an incident without reporting; and \n\tWhereas, Specifically, the legislation would result in a first-time hit-and-run offender who causes personal injury to face a charge of a class E felony, which would be commensurate with the charge faced by a drunk driver who causes serious physical injury and remains at the scene; and\n\tWhereas, Penalties should not be less severe for a driver who injures others and leaves the scene than for a drunk driver who causes serious physical injury and remains at the scene; and\n\tWhereas, Increasing the penalties for leaving the scene will deter drivers from leaving injured victims on the road, facilitate police investigation, and permit chemical testing of drivers by the police in cases where such testing is warranted; now, therefore, be it\n\tResolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.2503/A.1533, legislation which would increase the penalties for leaving the scene of a motor vehicle incident without reporting.\n\nLS# 1008\n3/18/2014\nJM",
