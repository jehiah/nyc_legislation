Consider switching to water;\" \"Drinking too many sugary drinks can promote diabetes and heart disease;\" and \"For better health, the U.S. government recommends that you limit your consumption of sugary drinks;\" and \n      Whereas, CSPI believes that warning labels will raise public awareness about the possible health concerns associated with consuming sugar sweetened beverages; and\n      Whereas, Government must take an increased role in combating the obesity epidemic; and\n      Whereas, Providing warning labels on sugar sweetened beverages is one method to educate the public about the serious health consequences associated with these products; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the United States Food and Drug Administration to require warning labels on sugar sweetened beverages.\n\n\n\nCP\nRes 1264/2012\nLS 445/2014",
