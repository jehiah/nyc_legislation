Aubry and currently pending in the New York State Assembly, and companion bill S.6466, sponsored by State Senator Bill Perkins and currently pending in the New York State Senate, seek to amend the New York State Correction Law by restricting the use of segregated confinement and creating alternative therapeutic and rehabilitative confinement options; and\n      Whereas, A.8588/S.6466 is also known as the Humane Alternatives to Long-Term Solitary Confinement Act or \"HALT Act\"; and\n      Whereas, The HALT Act would amend the New York State Correction Law by limiting the time an inmate spends in segregated confinement to a maximum of 15 consecutive days and a total of 20 days during a 60-day period; and\n      Whereas, The HALT Act would end the segregated confinement of vulnerable people, including, but not limited to, individuals with physical or mental disabilities; and\n      Whereas, Furthermore, the HALT Act would create alternatives to isolated confinement by providing a new Residential Rehabilitation Unit for meaningful human contact and therapeutic services and rehabilitative programs aimed at addressing underlying causes of behavior; and\n      Whereas, New York State should establish parameters on who can and cannot be placed in solitary confinement and provide appropriate therapeutic services to individuals who are in need; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the New York State Legislature to pass and the Governor to sign the Humane Alternatives to Long-Term Solitary Confinement Act.\nWJH\nLS 490\n2/12/14",
