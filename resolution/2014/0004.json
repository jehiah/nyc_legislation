  "Text": "By Council Members Cabrera, Chin, Constantinides, Levin, Palma, Williams and Cohen\n\n      Whereas, The New York City Housing Authority (\"NYCHA\") is a public housing authority with 334 developments, 2,596 buildings, and 178,914 public housing units, making it the largest public housing provider in North America; and\n      Whereas, Federal funding, which comprises the bulk of NYCHA's capital and operating budgets, has declined substantially over the past several years; and\n      Whereas, Since 2001, NYCHA's federal capital grants have fallen from $420 million annually to $270 million annually; and\n      Whereas, As the capital needs of NYCHA's aging infrastructure grow, operating expenses, such as maintenance and repair costs increase; and\n      Whereas, In addition to maintenance and repair costs, NYCHA's Operating Fund is used for a vast array of day-to-day operations including utilities; and\n      Whereas, According to NYCHA's most recent Five Year Operating Plan, utility expenditures, which make up a significant portion of NYCHA's operating budget, are expected to increase from $544 million in 2013 to $623 million in 2017; and\n      Whereas, NYCHA's operating budget is funded by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\"); and\n      Whereas, NYCHA's funding is based on the subsidy eligibility of all public housing authorities in the nation and HUD's annual federal appropriation; and\n      Whereas, If the national eligibility exceeds the federal appropriation, HUD must prorate the allocation of subsidy; and\n      Whereas, Since 2001, proration has resulted in a cumulative operating subsidy loss of over $750 million for NYCHA; and\n      Whereas, In 2007, the City released a long-term sustainability plan, PlaNYC 2030, which emphasized the critical importance of improving energy planning, reducing the City's energy consumption, modernizing electricity delivery infrastructure and expanding the City's clean power supply; and\n      Whereas, One example of such clean power supply can be found in the utilization of cogeneration, which simultaneously produces electricity and heat which may be harvested to heat buildings or provide hot water; and\n      Whereas, Cogeneration has significant environmental benefits, reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions; and\n      Whereas, Cogeneration is currently used in some buildings in New York City and may offer a significant reduction in such buildings' energy costs; and\n      Whereas, During this time of chronic underfunding, NYCHA should look at methods to reduce its utility and thereby operating expenses, while also helping to reduce the City's carbon footprint; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the New York City Housing Authority to assess the feasibility of utilizing cogeneration to increase energy efficiency in its developments.\n\nGP\nRes 899/2011\nLS 386/2014",
