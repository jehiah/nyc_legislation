Bill Tuition Fairness Act of 2014, H.R. 357 and S. 257, would allow expanded educational opportunities for veterans, by allowing them to attend the state-run higher-education institution of their choice at the in-state rate; and\n\tWhereas, H.R. 357 and S. 257, were introduced by House Representative Jeffrey Miller and Senator John Boozman, respectively; and\n\tWhereas, Under current law, the Post 9/11 G.I. Bill covers tuition and fees only at the in-state rate of public colleges and universities; and\n\tWhereas, According to the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), due to the wide variance in state residency laws, veterans often have a difficult task in establishing legal residency where they live; and\n\tWhereas, The legislation would require public colleges and universities to charge in-state tuition rates to all veterans in order for the school to be eligible to receive G.I. Bill educational payments; and\n\tWhereas, According to a College Board study of the 2012-2013 academic year, the average non-resident rate at public 4-year schools is $21,706, while resident rates average $8,655; and\n\tWhereas, H.R. 357 and S. 257 would ensure that veterans can attend an institution of higher learning that meets their specific needs without the burden of worrying about the significantly higher costs out-of-state residents must pay; and\n\tWhereas, The Act would provide a simple solution to the difficulties veterans often face in establishing permanent residency; and\n\tWhereas, According to the VFW, \"[o]ver the last couple of years, the VFW has heard from countless veterans driven into more expensive college programs because public schools offered no flexibility in residency requirements, prohibiting veterans from attending at the in-state rate\"; and\n\tWhereas, The Student Veterans of America has said that the proposed legislation \"addresses the issue of inequality within the Post 9/11 G.I. Bill and will do a great deal to support veterans' success in higher education\"; and\n\tWhereas, According to the bill's sponsor and House Veterans Committee Chairperson Miller, \"[t]he men and women who served this nation did not just defend the citizens of their home states, but the citizens of all 50 states\"; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the City of New York calls upon Congress to pass and the President to sign HR 357 and S 257, which legislation would expand educational opportunities for veterans. \n      \n      \nLS 1109\nMB\n4.2.14\n2",
