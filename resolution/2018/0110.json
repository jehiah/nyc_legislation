  "Text": "By Council Members Rosenthal, Brannan, Maisel and Rivera\n\n      Whereas, The United States Department of Justice stated in 2016 that the United States Constitution prohibits \"bail or bond practices that cause indigent defendants to remain incarcerated solely because they cannot afford to pay for their release;\" and\n      Whereas, The American Bar Association has promulgated national standards for pretrial detention that eliminate the use of commercial bail bonds, create a presumption of release on personal recognizance, encourage the use of \"non-financial conditions of release,\" and permit \"release on financial conditions only when no other conditions will ensure appearance;\" and\n      Whereas, The National Association of Pretrial Service Agencies has also called for the abolition of commercial bail bonds, a presumption of release on personal recognizance, and the use of financial conditions \"only when no other conditions will reasonably assure the defendant's appearance;\" and\n      Whereas, Both the New York City Criminal Justice Agency and the New York City Bar Association have called for the abolition of commercial bail bonds; and\n      Whereas, Extensive studies of the use of bail have found little to no meaningful distinction in return rates between those released with bail and those released on personal recognizance, and no meaningful distinction in return rates between varying amounts of bail; and\n      Whereas, Jurisdictions such as Washington D.C., etc. have successfully abolished the use of any form of monetary bail; and\n      Whereas, New York City has instituted a program that replaces monetary bail with a supervised release program based on a scientifically validated risk assessment tool, which has diverted thousands of criminal defendants from pretrial detention while simultaneously demonstrating a higher rate of return to court than those released without this form of release, and without any meaningful impact on public safety; and\n      Whereas, However, New York state's bail statutes continue to permit the use of commercial bail bondsmen and the use of cash bail, and contain no presumption of release on personal recognizance; and\n      Whereas, Furthermore, the judiciary in New York City continues to rely almost exclusively on commercial bail bonds and cash bail; and\n      Whereas, Based on these laws and practices, New York's current bail system unjustly and unconstitutionally incarcerates criminal defendants, who are entitled to a presumption of innocence, solely because they are too poor to afford monetary bail; and\n      Whereas, To address these fundamental statutory issues, A.5033/S.3579 proposes to abolish the use of monetary bail, and instead utilize a robust system of pretrial services to replace cash bail and commercial bail bonds; and\n      Whereas, Consistently with the recommendations of the American Bar Association and the National Association of Pretrial Service Agencies, A.5033/S.3579 would also create a presumption of release on recognize; and\n      Whereas, For those cases in which no method of release would be sufficient to ensure a defendant's appearance in court, A.5033/S.3579 would permit judges to remand defendants; and\n      Whereas, A.5033/S.3579 would bring New York State's bail statutes in line with constitutional standards and national best practices; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the State Legislature to pass and the Governor to sign A.5033/S.3579, in relation to reforming the State's bail system.\n\nLS 3711/Res. 1486/2017\nLS 32\nBC\n12/8/17",
