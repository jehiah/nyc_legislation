Klein and New York State Assembly Member Michael Cusick have introduced S.2722 and A.2970A, respectively, which would incorporate the Federal Analogue Act into New York law and ban chemicals substantially similar to those already scheduled as controlled substances; and\n\tWhereas, Support for the bill's passage is strong in the State Senate, which passed the bill in 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016; and\n\tWhereas, Passing this legislation would equip law enforcement with an important tool to fight against the use of synthetic cannabinoids and the resulting adverse effects; now, therefore, be it\n\tResolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.2722/A.2970A, which would ban chemicals substantially similar to those already designated as controlled substances. \n\nLS# 2791\n01/10/18\nLW/CA",
