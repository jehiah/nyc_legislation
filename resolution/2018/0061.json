  "Text": "By Council Members Levin and Brannan\n \n      Whereas, Bullying, name-calling and harassment are serious issues in schools and impact millions of students nationwide; and\n      Whereas, The National Center for Education Statistics reported that 13 million students are impacted by bullying each year, and according to the New York City Department of Education (DOE) 2016-17 School Survey, 43% of DOE students reported that students harass, bully or intimidate other students at their school some or most of the time; and\n      Whereas, Being a victim of bullying can hinder a student's academic achievement, and according to the National Voices for Education and Enlightenment approximately 160,000 children do not go to school every day because of bullying; and\n      Whereas, A National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) study of private, public, and parochial school students in grades 6 through 10 found that almost a third of these students, 5.7 million children nationwide, have experienced some sort of bullying; and\n      Whereas, Numerous researchers have indicated that victims of bullying have an increased risk of experiencing difficulties with depression, anxiety and sleep; and\n      Whereas, In addition, students who bully others are more likely to drink alcohol, smoke and carry a weapon; and\n      Whereas, While any student can be victimized by bullying and name-calling, students of marginalized groups are disproportionally victimized; and\n      Whereas, A parent survey by the Interactive Autism Network found that 63 percent of 1,167 children with autism spectrum disorder, aged 6 to 15, had been bullied; and\n      Whereas, Research published by the Journal of Developmental and Physical Disabilities discovered that students with disabilities worried about their safety in schools more often than their peers; and\n      Whereas, Additionally, there has been a recent increase of reported bullying and name-calling directed toward Muslim students in the United States; and\n      Whereas, According to the California chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, 55 percent of Muslim students were victimized by at least one form of religious-based bullying, which is double the national average of students who report bullying; and\n      Whereas, Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) students are also disproportionately victims of bullying; and\n      Whereas, According to a national report released by the Gay Lesbian Straight Education Network (GLSEN), 70.8 percent of LGBTQ students reported that they were verbally harassed at school because of their sexual orientation and 54.5 percent reported being verbally harassed because of their gender expression; and\n      Whereas, In 2015, 27 percent of LGBTQ students reported being physically harassed because of their sexual orientation and 20.3 percent reported being physically harassed because of their gender expression; and\n      Whereas, Bullying and name-calling disrupts tolerance, inclusion and respect, which are important values stressed by the DOE; and\n      Whereas, School is supposed to be a safe place, and no student should be subjected to bullying and name-calling while trying to pursue an education; and\n      Whereas, GLSEN's No Name-Calling Week, scheduled for January 15-19, 2018, is an important project that many coalitions of education and youth services organizations that work to end bullying in schools participate in; and\n      Whereas, No Name-Calling Week is a week in which thousands of schools celebrate kindness and help counteract bullying; and                     \n      Whereas, It is imperative that schools continue to promote kindness throughout the school year given the high prevalence of bullying and name-calling in schools and the negative impact such actions have on students; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York acknowledges January 15-19 as No Name-Calling Week in New York City schools.  \n \nLS #9944/Res. 1354-2017\nLS 782\nJP/KJ\n12/26/17",
