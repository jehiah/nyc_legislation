Casey Foundation \"often the loss of a license is caused more by poverty . . . than it is by a willful disregard for the law\"; and\n      Whereas, Although the suspension of a driver's license may serve as an effective enforcement method for some individuals, it is illogical to revoke the license of an individual who relies on a driver's license to generate income; and\n      Whereas, There are many other enforcement methods to collect child support arrears other than the suspension of a driver's license, which prohibits individuals such as taxicab drivers and deliverymen, whose ability to drive a vehicle is essential to their capacity to earn a living, from paying their child support; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New calls on the New York State Legislature to pass and the Governor to sign, legislation to amend the Domestic Relations Law and the Family Court Act to prevent the Division of Child Support Enforcement from suspending driving privileges for individuals who need a functioning New York State driver's license in order to earn a living. \nAV/JJ\nLS # 1387/Res. 0276-2014\nLS #718 12/19/2017 10:41AM\n      2\n      \n      \n      1",
