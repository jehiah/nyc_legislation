  "Text": "By Council Members Dromm, Ampry-Samuel, Van Bramer, Miller, Levine, Rivera, Richards, Constantinides, Ayala, Cumbo, Adams, Eugene, Rosenthal, Rodriguez, Grodenchik, Lander, Lancman, Powers, Holden, Maisel, Cornegy, Moya, Koslowitz, Menchaca, Rose, Salamanca, Gibson, Cabrera, Koo, Perkins, Brannan, Vallone, Levin, Torres, Barron, Reynoso, Kallos, Louis, Chin, Deutsch, Ulrich and the Public Advocate (Mr. Williams)\n \n      Whereas, Sickle cell disease (SCD) affects approximately 100,000 Americans and is most common in those with African, Hispanic, Mediterranean and Middle Eastern ancestry; and\n      Whereas, Nationally, SCD occurs in approximately 1:365 Black or African American births, 1:16,300 Hispanic births and 1:80,000 White births, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); and\n      Whereas, In New York State (NYS) SCD occurs in 1:230 live births to non-Hispanic Black mothers, 1:2,320 births to Hispanic mothers and 1:41,647 to non-Hispanic White mothers; and\n      Whereas, In NYS, 1:1,146 live births have SCD, with 86% of NYS sickle cell disease births among babies with Black mothers and 12% with Hispanic mothers; and\n      Whereas, Higher birth rates for SCD occur in mothers who were born outside of the US; and\n      Whereas, In NYS, approximately 70% of all newborns with SCD were born in the NYC area; and\n      Whereas, Persons with sickle cell trait (SCT) are carriers of the sickle cell gene who have inherited the normal hemoglobin gene from one parent and the sickle cell gene from the other parent; and\n      Whereas, Approximately 3 million Americans have SCT; and\n      Whereas, When both parents have SCT there is a 1 in 4 chance with each pregnancy that the child will be born with SCD; and\n      Whereas, Most people with SCT do not have any symptoms of SCD, however, in rare cases, people with SCT might experience complications of SCD; and\n      Whereas, The CDC states that SCD is a major public health concern; and\n      Whereas, Those with SCD may exhibit complications in all parts of the body; and\n      Whereas, This includes, but is not limited to, severe pain episodes, entrapment of blood within the spleen, severe anemia, acute lung complications (acute chest syndrome), stroke, priapism in males and other life-threatening conditions; and\n      Whereas, These life-threatening complications can develop rapidly, especially stroke and infections of the blood and brain; and\n      Whereas, Stroke can be either silent (no overt symptoms) or clinical (with symptoms); and\n      Whereas, Silent strokes occur in up to 35% of children with sickle cell anemia and clinically overt strokes occur in approximately 10% of children with sickle cell anemia, often causing cognitive impairments; and\n      Whereas, SCD is a cumulative disease with worsening complications and damage of organs, including lungs, heart and kidneys, as patients get older; and\n      Whereas, In addition, with the toll of the disease on patients, particularly to their brain, mental health issues can significantly impact the SCD patient and family; and\n      Whereas, As a complex disease with multisystem manifestations, SCD requires specialized, comprehensive and continuous care to achieve the best possible outcomes; and\n      Whereas, Newborn screening, genetic counseling and education of patients, family members, schools and health care providers are critical preventative measures; and\n      Whereas, Early detection can decrease morbidity, and holistic care reduces emergency room visits and in-patient hospital stays, decreasing overall costs of care; and\n      Whereas, Community-based organizations provide a valuable service in educating their communities about sickle cell disease and trait and, because they act as a bridge between the treatment centers and the community, should be included in any program to improve care to the community; and\n      Whereas, While SCD patients receiving regular care have improved clinical outcomes, many young adults transitioning out of pediatrics struggle to maintain their care; and\n      Whereas, A.6493/S.2281, sponsored by Senator James Sanders Jr. and Assembly Member Alicia Hyndman, would create eight regional prevention  and  treatment of SCD demonstration programs throughout NYS; and\n      Whereas, Over five years, the demonstration programs would coordinate service delivery, provide genetic counseling, conduct community outreach, promote mental health services and train health professionals; and\n      Whereas, A.6493/S.2281 would also create one statewide coordinating center to provide education and assistance to each program, establish statewide goals for standards of care, collect data and monitor progress; and\n      Whereas, A.6493/S.2281 would improve the quality of care for SCD patients, increase the average life expectancy for SCD patients, decrease the cost of care of sickle cell disease patients and educate communities about SCT and SCD; now, therefore, be it \n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the New York State Legislature to pass and fully fund, and the Governor to sign, A.6493/S.2281, legislation that would establish eight demonstration programs throughout New York State and one coordinating center to improve the care of sickle cell disease patients and educate about sickle cell trait. \n      \nCP\nLS 5512\n2/26/20",
