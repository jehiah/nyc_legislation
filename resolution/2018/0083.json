Klein, citing his frustration that federal legislation is stalled in Congress, introduced S.6279, the Deny Firearms to Dangerous Terrorists Act, which would prohibit individuals on the federal Watchlist from obtaining a firearm license in New York State; and \n                     Whereas, The act would also grant the Division of State Police the authority to revoke existing licenses of gun owners if they appear on the Watchlist; and\n                     Whereas, In addition, the act would mandate a review of the Watchlist at least once a year by the state police, who must remove all firearms from a suspected terrorist if one is found to have been issued a license; and\n                     Whereas, These measures are important steps in preventing known and suspected terrorists from obtaining guns and committing violence; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.6279, the Deny Firearms to Dangerous Terrorists Act, which would prohibit individuals on the federal Terrorist Watchlist from obtaining and possessing firearms.\nLS# 7122/Res. 1136\nLS # 1213\n01/04/18\nLW/CMA",
