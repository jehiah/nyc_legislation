Global Youth Day proves it.\", and\n                     Whereas, According to the Archdiocese of New York's Office of Youth Ministry (ANY), New York Catholic Youth Day is their annual Catholic youth celebration, a day filled with prayer, music, fun, games, and powerful speakers and conversations; and\n                     Whereas, A YD in New York City could be used to draw attention to the need for more youth programs within the city, and to underline the important need for such programs to be available for young New Yorkers from all walks of life; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York hereby declares Youth Day in New York City, to be held annually each year on August 12th, coinciding with International Youth Day.\n \nLS# 2774/ 501-2014\nLS# 721\n12/28/2017\nMB/ KK",
