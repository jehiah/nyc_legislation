EPA (2007) that greenhouse gases are \"air pollutants\" as defined by the Clean Air Act and that, therefore, the Environmental Protection Agency has authority to regulate them; and\n      Whereas, Using authorities embodied in Section 111 of the Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency can develop regulations to reduce greenhouse gas pollution from new and existing power plants; and\n      Whereas, The City of New York prides itself on being a leader in the fight against climate change and for clean air; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the Environmental Protection Agency and President Trump to fully enforce the Clean Air Act by regulating greenhouse gases in order to avert the potentially catastrophic effects of climate change.\n       \nDAA/NPJ\nLS 1650-2013/Res 14-2014 \nLS 772 \n1/3/18 3:43PM",
