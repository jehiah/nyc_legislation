Hardwick, Lawrence v. Texas, \"Don't Ask Don't Tell\" and the struggle for the recognition of LGBT families are all important and should be included in American history; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the New York City Department of Education to implement a curriculum and to acquire textbooks and trade books that include key moments in LGBT history and accurately portray the contributions of LGBT individuals in the history of the United States.   \n\nLS 1957/Res 0758-2011\nLS 889/Res 0564-2015\nNEW LS # 1122\nJP (2014)/MMB (2018)\n11/5/18; 12:42 p.m.",
