All of the value of the property in the Disposition Area, including both the land and any improvements (excluding those portions, if any, devoted to business or commercial use other than the Community Facility Space), shall be exempt from real property taxation, other than assessments for local improvements, for a period commencing upon the later of (i) the date of conveyance of the Disposition Area to the Sponsor, or (ii) the date that HPD and the Sponsor enter into a regulatory agreement governing the operation of the Disposition Area (\"Effective Date\") and terminating upon the earlier to occur of (i) a date which is forty (40) years from the Effective Date, (ii) the date of the expiration or termination of the regulatory agreement between HPD and the Sponsor, or (iii) the date upon which the Disposition Area ceases to be owned by either a housing development fund company or an entity wholly controlled by a housing development fund company (\"Expiration Date\"). \"Community Facility Space\" shall mean those portions of the Disposition Area which the Regulatory Agreement requires to be devoted solely to community facility uses.\n\nb.
