If the noncompliance specified in such notice is not cured within the time period specified therein, the New Exemption shall prospectively terminate.\n\nb. The New Exemption shall apply to all land in the Exemption Area, but shall only apply to buildings on the Exemption Area that exist on the Effective Date.\n\nc. Nothing herein shall entitle the HDFC, the Owner, or any other person of entity to a refund of any real property taxes which accrued and were paid with respect to the Exemption Area prior to the Effective Date.\n\n6. \tIn consideration of the New Exemption, the owner of the Exemption Area, for so long as the New Exemption shall remain in effect, shall waive the benefits of any additional or concurrent exemption  from or abatement of real property taxation which may be authorized  under any existing or future local, state, or federal law, rule, or regulation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the J-51 Benefits shall remain in effect, but (i) the New Exemption shall be reduced by the amount of such J-51 Benefits, and (ii) the Gross Rent Tax shall be reduced by such J-51 Benefits.\n\n\nAdopted.\n\n   \tOffice of the City Clerk, }\n   \tThe City of New York,  } ss.:\n\n  \t  \tI hereby certify that the foregoing is a true copy of a Resolution passed by The Council of The City of New York on September 12, 2018, on file in this office.\n\n\n  \t   \t\n\t\t\t\t       \t       ........................................\n  \t   \t       \t       \t       \t     \t\t\tCity Clerk, Clerk of The Council\n\n\nPage 2 of 4\n20195011 HAM\nRes.
