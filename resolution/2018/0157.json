No. 1650, which prohibited any person from charging consumers for services intended to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity; and\n      Whereas, California became the first state in the nation to enact legislation that would prohibit dangerous and discredited efforts by licensed mental health providers to change the sexual orientation of minor patients; and \n      Whereas, This ban was upheld by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2013 and again in 2016 with the U.S. Supreme Court declining to hear both cases; and\n      Whereas, The law provides that any sexual orientation change efforts attempted on a patient under 18 years of age by a mental health professional shall be considered unprofessional conduct and shall subject the provider to discipline by the provider's licensing entity; and\n      Whereas, Penalties for misconduct could range from temporary censorship and reprimand to the revoking of a license, up to $10,000 in fines and community service; and\n      Whereas, New York State should not permit licensed mental health professionals to practice therapies that have been proven harmful and should take action to prohibit these harmful and discriminatory practices; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the New York State Legislature to pass and the Governor to sign legislation which designates as professional misconduct, engaging in sexual orientation change efforts by mental health care professionals upon patients under 18 years of age.\n \n \nCP\nLS 897/Res. 130/2014\nLS 1118\n12/27/2017",
