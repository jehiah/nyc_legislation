Thompson, announced a policy which reflects changing attitudes toward prosecuting marihuana possession cases and indicated that his office would stop prosecuting most low-level marihuana cases; and\n      Whereas, The policy change applies to limiting prosecutions for (i) possession of marihuana in the fifth degree for either holding or burning marihuana in public view, or (ii) possessing more than 25 grams of marihuana, and (iii) unlawful possession of marihuana; and \n      Whereas, District Attorney Thompson should be applauded for his recognition that young people of color are disproportionately arrested and stigmatized for low-level marihuana possession and for making a policy change to evaluate whether or not to prosecute these cases; and\n      Whereas, However, this new policy is only in place in Brooklyn and only takes effect after someone has already been arrested; and \n      Whereas, While it would be beneficial for this policy to be implemented citywide, the NYPD should stop regularly arresting New Yorkers for low-level marihuana offenses; and \n      Whereas, The mayor should act expeditiously and issue an executive order to make it clear to New Yorkers and to the police that possession of small amounts of marihuana is not a significant public safety issue and that arresting New Yorkers on a routine basis is not in the public interest, now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the Mayor to issue an executive order directing the New York City Police Department to make marihuana-related misdemeanors and violations the lowest level enforcement priority for police arrests.\nSA/WJH\nLS #1491\n1/10/18",
