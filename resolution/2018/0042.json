Bloomberg in 2005, but its first director departed in 2007 and, according to Crain's New York Business, was never replaced; and\n      Whereas, Services that could be assigned to MOIMB include management of the IBZs and Industrial Business Solutions Providers (IBSPs), who provide technical assistance to manufacturing firms; and\n      Whereas, An expanded MOIMB could also oversee industrial-focused workforce and community development initiatives; and\n      Whereas, In expanding MOIMB, the City would grant the manufacturing sector a strong voice in City government, ensuring that land zoned for manufacturing is used as such, that technical assistance initiatives are sufficiently funded, and that technical assistance programs are designed to meet the unique needs of this vital sector; and\n      Whereas, In so doing, the City could encourage the development of innovative small industrial businesses, the growth of well-paying middle class jobs, and the progress of economic and community development; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the Mayor to revitalize the Mayor's Office of Industrial and Manufacturing Business and to expand the technical assistance the Office would offer manufacturing and industrial businesses in the City.\n \nPD/SSY\nLS #749/ Res.
