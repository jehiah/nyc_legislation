Peoples-Stokes and pending in the New York State Assembly, and companion bill S.3040-C, introduced by New York State Senator Liz Krueger and pending in the New York State Senate, seek to legalize, regulate, and tax the sale of marijuana in New York State; and\n                     Whereas, A.3506-C/S.3040-C is also known as the \"Marihuana Regulation and Taxation Act\"; and\n      Whereas, The Marihuana Regulation and Taxation Act would amend several statutes pertaining to the sale, enforcement, and taxation of marijuana including, but not limited to: (i) removing penalties for possession of certain amounts of marijuana; (ii) establishing 21 as the minimum legal age for marijuana possession and consumption; (iii) allowing for home cultivation of up to 6 marijuana plants; (iv) empowering the New York State Liquor Authority to grant licenses for marijuana production, transport, and retail sale; (v) prohibiting the sale of marijuana to individuals under 21 years-of-age; (vi) establishing a tax of marijuana and authorizing localities to charge a sales tax on retail sales; and (vii) directing a portion of the state tax revenue collected to be directed to re-entry programs, substance abuse programs, and job training programs in low-income, high-unemployment communities; and\n                     Whereas, The Marihuana Regulation and Taxation Act would help generate much needed state tax revenue, help to greatly reduce the racially disparate marijuana related arrests, and providing funding for community programs to better assist New York State residents; now therefore, be it\n                     Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the New York State Legislature to pass the Marihuana Regulation and Taxation Act and the Governor to sign such legislation into law, which would legalize, regulate, and tax the sale of marijuana in New York State.\nWJH\nLS 4813/ Res.
