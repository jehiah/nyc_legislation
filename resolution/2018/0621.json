The authorization to grant a non-exclusive franchise pursuant to this Resolution shall expire on the fifth anniversary of the date on which this Resolution is adopted by the City Council (Expiration Date).  No franchise shall be granted pursuant to this Resolution by DOT, nor approved by the FCRC or the Mayor, after the Expiration Date;\n \nAND BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, \n \nFIRST, that there shall be one uniform maximum fare for the Bus Service.  The appropriate maximum fare shall be included in the solicitation and the franchise agreement.  With regard to the uniform maximum fare, DOT may request from the FCRC a modification to any franchise agreement authorized by this Resolution changing the uniform maximum fare.  Any franchise agreement for Bus Service shall specify that upon the approval of the FCRC of any such proposed change, the franchise agreement shall be deemed to be modified to provide for the revised maximum fare;  \n \nSECOND, that prior to the granting of any such non-exclusive franchise, one or more Requests For Proposal (\"RFP\") shall be issued by DOT for each route or group of routes.

Such compensation shall not be considered in any manner to be in the nature of a tax, but such payments shall be made in addition to any and all taxes of whatsoever kind or description which are now or may at any time hereafter be required to be paid pursuant to any local law of the City or any law of the State of New York; or any law of the federal government;\n(3) the maximum fare shall be the uniform maximum fare for such service set by DOT, as such may be from time to time amended by DOT upon request to and approval by the FCRC;\n(4) the franchisee may be required to maintain integrated or reduced fare programs, the requirements for which shall be contained in the appropriate solicitation documents and franchise agreement; \n(5) the franchise may be terminated or canceled by the Commissioner in the event of the franchisee's failure to comply with the material terms and conditions of the agreement;\n(6) there shall be remedies, including liquidated damages, to protect the City's interests in the event of the franchisee's failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the agreement;\n(7) a security fund or other appropriate method shall be established to insure the performance of the franchisee's obligations under the agreement;\n(8) the franchise may permit or require advertising in the interior and/or exterior of buses; provided however, that advertising which is false or misleading, which promotes unlawful or illegal goods, services or activities, or which is otherwise unlawful, including but not limited to advertising that constitutes the public display of offensive sexual material in violation of Penal Law Section 245.11, shall be prohibited.  In addition, advertising related to tobacco products and electronic  cigarettes shall also be prohibited; \n(9) there shall be provisions regulating the technical specifications of bus equipment used to provide authorized Bus Service;\n(10) there shall be provisions to ensure adequate oversight and regulation of the franchisee by the City, including adherence to standards of performance and guidelines for service;\n(11) the City shall have the right at all times to inspect the facilities, service and equipment used by the franchisee and to order compliance with operational requirements and performance standards set forth in the agreement;\n(12) there shall be adequate insurance and indemnification requirements to protect the interests of the public and the City;\n(13) the franchisee shall be required to maintain complete and accurate books of account and records in compliance with any and all specific requirements for recordkeeping as shall be established by DOT.

Any changes in the number of weekly scheduled vehicle revenue miles on any route that exceed twenty-five percent (25%) or changes in the span of service of greater than four hours of any given route, either cumulatively within a three year period or singly, must receive the prior written approval of the Commissioner, a copy of which shall be sent to the FCRC;\n(23) there may be provisions for free reciprocal transfer privileges between routes operated by the franchisee and intersecting surface routes of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority New York City Transit (\"MTA NYCT\"), the Manhattan and Bronx Surface Transit Operating Authority (\"MABSTOA\"), and the MTA Bus Company (together \"the Operators\"), and in addition with the franchisee's own intersecting routes .  To the extent that such reciprocal transfer privileges require the agreement of the Operators, the franchisee shall take all reasonable steps to obtain such agreement and DOT shall assist the franchisee in obtaining such agreement.\n \nSEVENTH, the streets comprising the route over which franchised Bus Service will be provided shall be described in the RFP and included in the franchise agreement.   All changes to the routes or those streets must receive the prior written approval of the Commissioner before such change may be implemented. Where such changes to that route or those streets, either cumulatively within a three year period or singly, represent twenty-five percent (25%) or less of the total mileage of the route, a copy of the Commissioner's approval shall be sent to the FCRC for its information; where such changes to that route or those streets, either cumulatively within a three year period or singly, represent more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the total mileage of the route the written approval of the Commissioner shall be submitted to the FCRC for its additional approval prior to the implementation thereof.\n \nAnd be it further RESOLVED, that DOT shall file with the Council the following documents:\n \n(1)  within fifteen (15) days of issuance, a copy of each RFP issued pursuant to this Resolution;\n(2) within fifteen (15) days of approval by the Mayor, a copy of the agreement for any franchise granted pursuant to this Resolution;\n(3) within fifteen (15) days of approval by the Commissioner or the FCRC, a copy of any amendments to any franchise granted pursuant to this Resolution; and\n(4) on or before July 1 of each year, for the preceding calendar year, a report detailing the revenues received by the City from any franchise granted pursuant to this Resolution.\n   \nAdopted.\n \n       Office of the City Clerk, }\n      \tThe City of New York,  } ss.:\n \n           \t\tI hereby certify that the foregoing is a true copy of a Resolution passed by The Council of The City of New York on ____, 20__ on file in this office.\n \n \n \n.......................................\nCity Clerk, Clerk of the Council",
