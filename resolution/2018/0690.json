Nothing herein shall entitle the HDFC, the Owner, or any other person or entity to a refund of any real property taxes which accrued and were paid with respect to the Exemption Area prior to the Effective Date.\n5. In consideration of the Exemption, the owner of the Exemption Area shall, for so long as the Exemption shall remain in effect, waive the benefits of any additional or concurrent exemption from or abatement of real property taxation which may be authorized under any existing or future local, state, or federal law, rule, or regulation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prohibit the granting of any real property tax abatement pursuant to Sections 467-b or 467-c of the Real Property Tax Law to real property occupied by senior citizens or persons with disabilities. \n\nOffice of the City Clerk,     }                                                               \nThe City of New York        } ss.:\n \nI hereby certify that the foregoing is a true copy of a Resolution passed by The Council of the City of New York on December 20, 2018, on file in this office.\n                                           \n                                          _______________________\n                                          City Clerk, Clerk of Council",
