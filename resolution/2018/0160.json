Gantt and S.2888 by Senator Martin Malave Dilan) would amend the New York State Vehicle and Traffic law to include e-bikes in the State definition of bicycles and thus permit their use; and\n      Whereas, If adopted, the State legislation would limit e-bikes to having a power output of \"no more than seven hundred fifty watts\" and speed of no more than twenty miles per hour; and\n      Whereas, New York City is seeing rapid diversification in its transportation infrastructure, including greater use of conventional and electric bicycles for both recreational and commercial purposes; and\n      Whereas, E-bikes can make a positive contribution to the health and economic well-being of the City; now, therefore, be it\n                     Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the State Legislature to enact and for the Governor to sign A.1018 and S.2888, which would amend the State Vehicle and Traffic law to include \"electric assisted\" bicycles in the definition of bicycles and thus permit their use.\nGZ\nLS# 585/Res.
