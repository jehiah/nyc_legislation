The Proposed City Fiscal Year 2021 Community Development Program, Proposed Reallocation of Forty-Sixth Year Community Development Funds, and Proposed Forty-Seventh Year Community Development Program were submitted by the Mayor to the Council on April 16, 2020 and referred to the Committee on Finance.  \n\nAnalysis.  The Committee on Finance held hearings on the 6th, 12th, 14th, 18th, 20th, and 21st of May, 2020. The testimony elicited at these hearings regarding the budget as a whole and with respect to specific needs and projects was supplemented by further data developed at the meetings of the Committee on Finance, and from Council staff and representatives of City agencies. The primary concern of the Committee was that the funding contained in the Proposed City Fiscal Year 2021 Community Development Program would meet the actual and perceived needs of the communities the City of New York comprises.\n\nIn its deliberations, the Committee on Finance took into consideration the testimony of the citizenry at the public hearings and the information furnished by Council Members, staff assistants, and City agencies.\n\nAs a result of the Committee on Finance's deliberation, the Committee recommends the following: \n\n1. A City Fiscal Year 2021 Community Development Program totaling $368,704,000; and\n2. A Reallocated Forty-Sixth Year Community Development Program totaling $277,081,000; and \n3.
