  "Text": "By Council Members Salamanca and Moya\n\n\tWHEREAS, GO Broome, LLC and Chinatown Planning Council Development Fund, Inc., filed an application pursuant to Section 201 of the New York City Charter, for an amendment of the text of the Zoning Resolution of the City of New York, modifying the Quality Housing provisions of Article II, Chapters 3 and 8, and related provisions, and APPENDIX F for the purpose of establishing a Mandatory Inclusionary Housing area, which in conjunction with the related actions would facilitate the development of two new mixed-use developments containing mostly residential uses, and community facility and commercial uses (the proposed development) in Manhattan Community District 3 (Application No. N 200065 ZRM), (the \"Application\");\n\n\tWHEREAS, the City Planning Commission filed with the Council on January 21, 2020, its decision dated January 21, 2020 (the \"Decision\"), on the Application;\n\n\tWHEREAS, the Application is related to applications C 200061(A) ZSM (L.U. No. 606), a zoning special permit pursuant to Zoning Resolution (ZR) Section 78-312 to waive height, setback, and distance between buildings regulations of ZR Section 23-60 and 23-70; and C 200064 ZMM (L.U. No. 607), a zoning map amendment to change an R8 district to an R9-1 district with a C2-5 overlay; \n\n\tWHEREAS, the Decision is subject to review and action by the Council pursuant to Section 197-d of the City Charter;\n\tWHEREAS, upon due notice, the Council held a public hearing on the Decision and Application on January 30, 2020;\n\n\tWHEREAS, the Council has considered the land use implications and other policy issues relating to the Decision and Application; and\n\n\tWHEREAS, the Council has considered the relevant environmental issues, including the positive declaration, issued on January 25, 2019 (CEQR No. 19DCP119M) and a Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for which a Notice of Completion was issued on January 10, 2020 which identified significant adverse impacts with respect to construction (vehicular traffic and noise) and transportation (vehicular traffic and pedestrian traffic) and significant adverse impacts related to hazardous materials, air quality, and noise would be avoided through the placement of (E) designations (E-548) on the project sites.  In addition, the FEIS analyzed the amended application and concluded that the amended application would not change the conclusions of the FEIS and the significant adverse impact categories would remain the same and the identified significant adverse impacts and proposed mitigation measures are included in the Restrictive Declaration attached as Exhibit A and Exhibit B to the Decision.\n\nRESOLVED:\n\n\tHaving considered the FEIS with respect to the Decision and Application, the Council finds that:\n \t\n(1) The FEIS meets the requirements of 6 N.Y.C.R.R. Part 617; \n\n(2) Consistent with social, economic and other essential considerations from among the reasonable alternatives available, the action is one that avoids or minimizes adverse environmental impacts to the maximum extent practicable; and\n\n(3) The adverse environmental impacts identified in the FEIS will be minimized or avoided to the maximum extent practicable by incorporating as conditions to the approval, pursuant to two Restrictive Declarations marked as Exhibit A and Exhibit B, those project components related to the environment and mitigation measures that were identified as practicable and the placement of (E) designation (E-548) for hazardous materials, air quality, and noise; and \n\n(4) No development pursuant to this resolution shall be permitted until the Restrictive Declarations attached as Exhibit A and Exhibit B, as same may be modified with any necessary administrative or technical changes, all as acceptable to Counsel to the Department of City Planning and Counsel to the Landmarks Preservation Commission, as executed by GO Broome LLC and The Chinatown Planning Council Housing Development Fund Company or its successor, and such Restrictive Declaration shall have been recorded and filed in the Office of the Register of the City of New York, County of New York.\n\n\tThe Decision, together with the FEIS constitute the written statement of facts, and of social, economic and other factors and standards that form the basis of this determination, pursuant to 6 N.Y.C.R.R. �617.11(d).\n\nMatter underlined is new, to be added;\nMatter struck out is old, to be deleted;\nMatter within #   # is defined in Section 12-10;\n*   *   * indicates where unchanged text appears in the Zoning Resolution.\n\n\nMatter underlined is new, to be added.\nMatter struckout is to be deleted.\nMatter with # # is defined in Section 12-10.\n*     *     *  indicates where unchanged text appears in the Zoning Resolution.\n\nArticle II - Residence District Regulations\n\n*\t*\t*\n\nChapter 3\nResidential Bulk Regulations in Residence Districts\n\n*\t*\t*\n\n23-011\nQuality Housing Program\n\nR5D R6A R6B R7A R7B R7D R7X R8A R8B R8X R9A R9D R9X R10A R10X\n\n(a)\tIn R6A, R6B, R7A, R7B, R7D, R7X, R8A, R8B, R8X, R9A, R9D, R9X, R10A or R10X Districts, any #building or other structure# shall comply with the #bulk# regulations for #Quality Housing buildings# set forth in this Chapter and any #building# containing #residences# shall also comply with the requirements of Article II, Chapter 8 (Quality Housing Program).

For such developments, the regulations of this Chapter are designed to allow greater flexibility for the purpose of securing better site planning for development of vacant land and to provide incentives toward that end while safeguarding the present or future use and development of surrounding areas and, specifically, to achieve more efficient use of increasingly scarce land within the framework of the overall bulk controls, to enable open space in large-scale residential developments to be arranged in such a way as best to serve active and passive recreation needs of the residents, to protect and preserve scenic assets and natural features such as trees, streams and topographic features, to foster a more stable community by providing for a population of balanced family sizes, to encourage harmonious designs incorporating a variety of building types and variations in the siting of buildings, and thus to promote and protect public health, safety and general welfare. \n\n*\t*\t*\n\n78-03\nApplicability of This Chapter\n\n#Large-scale residential developments# are governed by all the #use#, #bulk#, off-street parking and loading, and other applicable regulations of this Resolution, except for such special provisions as are specifically set forth in this Chapter and apply only to such #large-scale residential developments#. However, the Quality Housing Program is inapplicable in #large-scale residential development#.\n\nAny #large-scale residential development# having a total of at least 500 #dwelling units# shall be subject to the provisions of Section 78-11 (General Provisions), relating to Provision of Public Facilities in Connection with Large-Scale Residential Developments.\n\n#Large-scale residential developments# within the #waterfront area# shall be subject to the provisions of Section 62-132 (Applicability of Article VII, Chapters 4, 8 and 9).\n\n*\t*\t*\n\nAPPENDIX F\nInclusionary Housing Designated Areas and Mandatory Inclusionary Housing Areas\n\n*\t*\t*\n\nMANHATTAN\n\n*\t*\t*\n\nManhattan Community District 3\n\n*\t*\t*\n\nMap 3 - [date of adoption]\n\n[PROPOSED MAP]\n\n\n*\t*\t*\n\nEND\n\nAdopted.\n\n      Office of the City Clerk, }\n      \tThe City of New York,  } ss.:\n\n      \tI hereby certify that the foregoing is a true copy of a Resolution passed by The Council of The City of New York on February 27, 2020, on file in this office.\n\n\n\n\n     \t       \t       \t       \t    \t\t\t          ....................................................\t       \t       \t       \t       \t     \t\t\t          City Clerk, Clerk of The Council \n\nPage 12 of 12\nN 200065 ZRM\nRes.
