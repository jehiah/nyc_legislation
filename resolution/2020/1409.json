Gottfried, and companion bill S.4981-B, introduced by New York State Senator Jessica Ramos, seek to strengthen existing state laws by amending the New York State Criminal Procedure Law by vacating convictions for offenses resulting from sex trafficking, labor trafficking, and compelling prostitution; and\n\tWhereas, A.6983-B/S.4981-B would include documentation with regard to sex   trafficking, labor trafficking, and aggravated labor trafficking as additional grounds for a presumption that a victim was indeed a victim of trafficking; and\n            \tWhereas, A.6983-B/S.4981-B would require that judgments be vacated on the merits because the defendant's participation in the offense was a result of having been a victim of trafficking; and\t\n           \t Whereas, A.6983-B passed the Assembly and was delivered to the Senate on July 21, 2020; and\n          Whereas, Enacting this legislation would strengthen the state human trafficking law and focus on protecting victims; now, therefore, be it resolved\n\t    Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the New York State Legislature to pass and the Governor to sign A.6983-B/S.4981-B, which would amend the New York State Criminal Procedure Law by strengthening protections for victims of human and sex trafficking.\n\nWJH\nLS 13509\n8/18/20",
