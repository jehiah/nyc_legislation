Code, to forbid the use of chokeholds as a civil rights violation; and\n      Whereas, This law would enable federal authorities to hold accountable police officers involved in the killing of George Floyd and similar tragic incidents; and\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the upon the United States Congress to pass, and the President to sign, the Eric Garner Excessive Use of Force Prevention Act of 2019 (H.R. 4408), which would prohibit police chokeholds and other tactics that result in asphyxiation.\nLS #15250\n6/1/2020\nCGR\n2",
