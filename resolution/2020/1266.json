No. 606), a zoning special permit pursuant to Zoning Resolution (ZR) Section 78-312 to waive height, setback, and distance between buildings regulations of ZR Section 23-60 and 23-70; and N 200065 ZRM (L.U. No. 608), a zoning text amendment to Appendix F; ZR Section 23-011, 28-01, and 78-03 to designate a Mandatory Inclusionary Housing (MIH) area and allow use of the Quality Housing Program;\n\n      WHEREAS, the Decision is subject to review and action by the Council pursuant to Section 197-d of the City Charter;\n      \n      WHEREAS, upon due notice, the Council held a public hearing on the Decision and Application on January 30, 2020;\n      WHEREAS, the Council has considered the land use and other policy issues relating to the Decision and Application; and\n\tWHEREAS, the Council has considered the relevant environmental issues, including the positive declaration, issued on January 25, 2019 (CEQR No. 19DCP119M) and a Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for which a Notice of Completion was issued on January 10, 2020 which identified significant adverse impacts with respect to construction (vehicular traffic and noise) and transportation (vehicular traffic and pedestrian traffic), and significant adverse impacts related to hazardous materials, air quality, and noise would be avoided through the placement of (E) designations (E-548) on the project sites.  In addition, the FEIS analyzed the amended application and concluded that the amended application would not change the conclusions of the FEIS and the significant adverse impact categories would remain the same and the identified significant adverse impacts and proposed mitigation measures are included in the Restrictive Declaration attached as Exhibit A and Exhibit B to the Decision.\n\nRESOLVED:\n\n\tHaving considered the FEIS with respect to the Decision and Application, the Council finds that:\n\t\n(1) The FEIS meets the requirements of 6 N.Y.C.R.R.
