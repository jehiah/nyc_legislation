Bailey, would eliminate the cost of phone calls for those imprisoned in state correctional facilities; and\n      Whereas, On March 14, 2020, Governor Andrew M. Cuomo implemented restrictions on visitations to state correctional facilities, in order to reduce in-person contact in light of the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n      Whereas, The Federal Bureau of Prisons began providing free telephone calls to all inmates in all of the 122 federal facilities it oversees as of April 9, 2020; and \n      Whereas, By similarly providing free telephone calls in DOCCS correctional facilities, the State of New York would help persons incarcerated in these facilities by offering them a method of maintaining contact with their families, particularly while visitation continues to be restricted; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, A.7658A/S.6276, in relation to providing telephone calls to persons incarcerated in state correctional facilities at no cost.\n   \nLS #11722\n5/12/20\nTWN\n\n\n1",
