  "Text": "By The Public Advocate (Mr. Williams) and Council Members Brannan, Kallos and Chin\n\n      Whereas, In 2020, the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, spread rapidly throughout the United States, leading to over 1.1 million confirmed cases of the virus and nearly 64,000 confirmed deaths, as of May 1, 2020; and \n      Whereas, COVID-19's impact has been especially damaging to New York City, which reports over 167,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases and nearly 13,000 confirmed COVID-19 deaths, as of May 1, 2020; and\n      Whereas, To combat the spread of the virus, Governor Andrew M. Cuomo issued Executive Order 202.6, also known as the New York State on PAUSE Executive Order, on March 20, 2020, which mandated that nonessential businesses close their in-person stores; and \n      Whereas, Executive Order 202.6 also outlined twelve categories of business that are designated as essential and are not subject to the in-person restriction, including essential health care, infrastructure, manufacturing, services, and retail; and \n      Whereas, Many workers in these industries, who are also referred to as essential workers, are still required to work on-site during the COVID-19 pandemic, and face heightened exposure to the virus as a result; and\n      Whereas, An April 8, 2020 report by the Fiscal Policy Institute (FPI) found that New York City has roughly one million essential workers; and\n      Whereas, Essential workers are disproportionately likely to be low-income, as the same FPI report also found that 24% of essential workers in New York City have a family income below 200% of the federal poverty level; and \n      Whereas, Hazard pay refers to extra payment for working under dangerous conditions; and\n      Whereas, The April 2020 COVID-19 Employer Response Survey, administered by the global human resources association WorldatWork, surveyed over 1500 employers and found that 70% did not plan to offer hazard pay or financial incentives of any kind to its workers; and\n      Whereas, In March 2020, the United States Congress passed a series of relief packages designed to provide worker benefits and economic stimulus in the midst of the pandemic; and\n      Whereas, On April 7, 2020, Senate Democrats proposed including a \"Heroes' Fund\" in the next coronavirus relief package, which would be used to offer a $25,000 pay increase to all essential frontline workers during the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n      Whereas, Granting hazard pay to essential frontline workers during the COVID-19 pandemic would compensate these workers for the heightened levels of risk they face, and would also grant these workers additional financial security during this crisis; and\n      Whereas, Provision of these funds by the federal government would alleviate any potential financial burden to employers, as well as to state and local governments; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the United States Congress to pass, and the President to sign, legislation creating the \"Heroes' Fund\" to provide hazard pay to employees required to work on-site during COVID-19.\n\n\n\nLS #14560\n05/13/20\nTWN\n1",
