Cuomo apologized to despairing New Yorkers who have repeatedly been unable to secure unemployment insurance on the DOL's website which has continually been crashing; and\n      \n      Whereas, On April 9, 2020, the DOL issued a press release announcing its partnership with technology company Google and service provider Verizon to help restore its operations; and\n      Whereas, Given the recent attempt to create a more reliable online system for New Yorkers, the Pew Research Center found that 71 percent of Americans who filed for unemployment in March still hadn't received benefits by late April; and\n      Whereas, The DOL was aware that its unemployment insurance system has needed an upgrade for years, as demonstrated by a 2017 Request for Proposals for a \"system solution\" to completely revamp the underlying system which allows New Yorkers to receive benefits; and\n      Whereas, Several New York Senators have expressed concern with the DOL's backlogging failures by highlighting the immediate need to improve the technological capabilities of the DOL and ensure that a long-term solution is put in place to further protect New Yorkers from economic disasters; and\n      Whereas, Unemployment benefits are often the last line of defense for those struggling with economic shortfalls, and their livelihoods depend on the DOL's ability to administer services efficiently and promptly, which requires an urgent strategy that updates technology and streamlines operations; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the New York State Department of Labor to implement a new emergency response plan to modernize its capabilities to better prepare for economic disasters.\n\n\nLS #14652\n06/03/2020\nAH\n\n\n\n2",
