John Cornyn (R-TX) on July 22, 2020 and Rep. Peter Welch (D-VT-At Large) on July 27, 2020  authorizing the United States Small Business Association to make initial grants up to $12 million dollars to eligible operators, promoters, producers or representatives with additional supplemental grants equal to 50 percent of the initial grant to be used for costs and expenses including payroll, rent, utilities and personal protective equipment (PPE) incurred between March 1, 2020 through June 30, 2021; \n      Whereas, The possibility of permanent closure of these independent venues threatens the ability of the artistic community to hone their craft and catch the attention of industry professionals seeking to develop new talent, while also depriving local neighborhoods the opportunity to support and cultivate local artists and patrons who constitute the epicenter of the cultural and economic community in each neighborhood; now, therefore, be it, \n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York call on Congress to pass, and the President to sign, the Save Our Stages (SOS) Bill (S.4258/H.R.7806) to establish a grant program for small live venue operators and talent representatives to address the economics effects of COVID-19.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLS #15993\n9/8/2020\nCD\n      \n      \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1",
