  "Text": "By Council Members Rivera, Rosenthal and Kallos\n \n      Whereas, According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a pregnancy-related death is defined as the death of a person while pregnant or within one year of the end of a pregnancy (regardless of the outcome or duration of the pregnancy) from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or incidental causes; and\n      Whereas, Data from the CDC find that about one-third of all pregnancy-related deaths occur one week to one year after a pregnancy ends; and\n      Whereas, In 2016, New York State was ranked 30th in the nation for its maternal mortality rate, with clear racial disparities; and\n      Whereas, New York State had a maternal mortality rate for Black women of 52 deaths per 100,000 live births, compared to 16 deaths per 100,000 live births for white women during 2014-2016; and\n      Whereas, According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the postpartum period represents a time of increased vulnerabilities; and\n      Whereas, In addition to monitoring a person's physical wellbeing postpartum, it is important to maintain access to mental health and substance use disorder treatment services during this time; and \n      Whereas, Those with opioid use disorder relapse far more often in the postpartum period compared with during pregnancy and should have access to and continued use of treatment services; and\n      Whereas, New York State offers Medicaid to pregnant New York residents who meet income requirements, regardless of immigration status; and\n      Whereas, In the Medicaid for pregnancy program, babies receive health care services for at least one year after birth, but the pregnant individual only receives care for 60 days after the end of pregnancy; and\n      Whereas, New York State only offers family planning services to those who lose their Medicaid for pregnant parents coverage; and\n      Whereas, S.7147-A/A.9156, sponsored by Senator Gustavo Rivera and Assembly Member Richard Gottfried, would extend the Medicaid coverage period for medical assistance to a period of one year beginning on the last day of pregnancy; and\n      Whereas, In New York State, over 60 percent of births were covered by Medicaid in 2017; and\n      Whereas, In New York City in 2017, 70 percent of Black infant births, 78 percent of Hispanic infant births and 59 percent Asian/Pacific Islander infant births were covered by Medicaid compared to 37 percent white infant births; and\n      Whereas, The expansion of Medicaid eligibility has been associated with 1.6 fewer maternal deaths per 100,000 women compared with states that didn't expand the program; and\n      Whereas, The CDC has found that three in five pregnancy-related deaths could be prevented; and\n      Whereas, According to CDC Director Dr. Robert R. Redfield, \"Ensuring quality care for [pregnant parents] throughout their pregnancies and postpartum should be among our Nation's highest priorities\"; and\n      Whereas, Extending Medicaid coverage past 60 days postpartum is a commonsense way to save lives and improve parent and child health outcomes and could help reduce stark racial disparities in maternal mortality; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the State Legislature to pass and the Governor to sign S.7147-A/A.9156, which would expand Medicaid benefits to one year postpartum\n       \nCP\nLS 15870 \n9/1/20",
