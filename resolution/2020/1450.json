HPD shall deliver written notice of any such determination to the property owner and all mortgagees of record, which notice shall provide for an opportunity to cure of not less than 60 days.  If the noncompliance specified in such notice is not cured within the time period specified therein, the Article XI Exemption shall prospectively terminate.\n\nd.\tThe provisions of the Article XI Exemption shall apply separately to each individual property comprising the Disposition Area, and a sale or other event which would cause the expiration, termination, or revocation of the Article XI Exemption with respect to one property in the Disposition Area shall not affect the continued validity of the Article XI Exemption with respect to other properties in the Disposition Area.\n\n\nThe Council approves the exemption of the project from real property taxes pursuant to Section 696 of the General Municipal Law as follows:\n\na.\tAll of the value of the buildings, structures, and other improvements situated on the Disposition Area shall be exempt from local and municipal taxes, other than assessments for local improvements and land value, for a period of 20 years commencing on the date of reconveyance of the Disposition Area to an owner which is not a housing development fund company (\"UDAAP Commencement Date\"); provided, however, that such exemption shall decrease in ten equal annual decrements commencing upon the July 1st immediately preceding the tenth anniversary of the UDAAP Commencement Date.\n\nb.\tIn consideration of the tax exemption pursuant to Section 696 of the General Municipal Law provided hereunder (\"UDAAP Exemption\"), the owner of the Disposition Area shall waive the benefits, if any, of any Alternative Tax Benefit for so long as the UDAAP Exemption shall remain in effect.\n\nc.\tThe UDAAP Exemption shall terminate with respect to all or any portion of the Disposition Area if the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (\"HPD\") determines that such real property has not been, or is not being, developed, used, and/or operated in compliance with the requirements of all applicable agreements made by the transferee or any subsequent owner of such real property with, or for the benefit of, the City of New York.  HPD shall deliver written notice of any such determination of noncompliance to the owner of such real property and all mortgagees of record, which notice shall provide for an opportunity to cure of not less than 90 days.  If the noncompliance specified in such notice is not cured within the time period specified therein, the UDAAP Exemption shall prospectively terminate with respect to the real property specified therein.\n\nd.\tNotwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, the combined duration of the Article XI Exemption and the UDAAP Exemption shall not exceed 25 years.\n\ne.\tThe provisions of the UDAAP Exemption shall apply separately to each individual property comprising the Disposition Area, and a sale or other event which would cause the expiration, termination, or revocation of the UDAAP Exemption with respect to one property in the Disposition Area shall not affect the continued validity of the UDAAP Exemption with respect to other properties in the Disposition Area.\n\n\n\nPROJECT SUMMARY\n\n1.\tPROGRAM:\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOPEN DOOR PROGRAM\n\n2.\tPROJECT:\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOld Stanley II\n\n3.\tLOCATION:\n\n\ta.\tBOROUGH:\t\t\t\t\t\tBrooklyn\n\n\tb.\tCOMMUNITY DISTRICT:\t\t\t\t4\n\n\tc.\tCOUNCIL DISTRICTS:\t\t\t\t34 & 37\n\n\td.\tDISPOSITION AREA:\t\t\t\tBLOCKS\t\tLOTS\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3440\t\t\t35\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3232\t\t\t63                        \n\n4.\tBASIS OF DISPOSITION PRICE:\t\t\tNominal.
