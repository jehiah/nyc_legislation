  "Text": "By Council Members Salamanca and Moya\n\n      WHEREAS, Restrictive Declaration D-94 dates from April 13, 1984, and was enacted in connection with an approval for a Zoning Map amendment (M 840260 ZMM), sponsored by the Rockrose Development Corporation and affecting a nearby two-block area bounded by Gansevoort, Washington, W. 12th and West streets.  This action generally changed the zoning designation on these two blocks from M1-5 and C8-4 districts to a C6-2A District;\n\n      WHEREAS, as mitigation of potentially significant adverse impacts resulting from the Zoning Map amendment, a Restrictive Declaration (D-94) (the \"Original Declaration\") was imposed on the Project Site, providing that the use of the Project Site be limited to certain commercial and light manufacturing uses as were defined in then-Section 15-58 of the New York City Zoning Resolution.  The Original Declaration, obligates the owner of these properties to maintain space for meat-related uses contained in Use Groups 17A and 17B and, in the event of a vacancy, to use best efforts to rent to such uses;\n\n      WHEREAS, the Original Declaration was modified in 1998 (the \"First Amended Declaration\"), pursuant to an application to modify the project (M 840260B ZMM), to allow Use Group 6 uses, as allowed within an M1-5 District, for property located at 46-50 Gansevoort Street (Block 643, Lot 54), while Lots 43 and 49 would continue to be limited to those permitted uses listed in Exhibit D of the Original Declaration;\n\n      WHEREAS, the Original Declaration, as amended, was further modified in 2003 (the \"Second Amended Declaration\"), pursuant to an application to modify the project (M 840260C ZMM), expanding the permitted uses to allow Use Groups 6 and 9 on Lots 43 and 49 and Use Group 9 on Lot 54 (as Use Group 6 uses were already permitted on Lot 54 pursuant to the 1998 Declaration).  This modification did not affect the prohibition on office uses (Use Group 6B), eating and drinking establishments with entertainment uses, and eating and drinking establishments of any type located in the rear yards or on the roof on lots 43, 49, and 54; and\n\n      WHEREAS, the City Planning Commission filed with the Council on January 24, 2020 its decision dated January 22, 2020 (the \"Decision\"), on the application submitted by 60-74 Gansevoort Street LLC, 52-58 Gansevoort Street LLC, and 46-50 Gansevoort Street LLC, for modification to Restrictive Declaration D-94, as amended, to allow Use Group 3, 4, and 6B uses, as permitted by the underlying M1-5 zoning, in an existing building located at 46-74 Gansevoort Street (Block 643, Lots 43, 49, and 54) (the proposed \"Third Amended Declaration\").
