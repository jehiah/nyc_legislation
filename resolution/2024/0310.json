  "Text": "Whereas, Alternate side parking rules in New York City (NYC) require owners of parked motor vehicles to move their vehicles during fixed time periods to allow for street cleaning by NYC Department of Sanitation street sweepers; and\n      Whereas, Motor vehicles in violation of alternate side parking rules in NYC obstruct street sweepers and make it more difficult for the NYC Department of Sanitation to keep NYC's streets clean; and\n      Whereas, Requiring NYC enforcement agents to affix notices of violation to the windshields of motor vehicles in violation of alternate side parking rules is a burden on limited city resources; and\n      Whereas, An NYC program involving the installation of cameras on street sweepers to photograph alternate side parking violations and the service of notices of violation by first-class mail would allow for more effective enforcement of alternate side parking violations; and\n      Whereas, The New York City Council previously passed Local Law 160 of 2018, which created a local camera enforcement program to detect motor vehicles exceeding the speed limit in school speed zones; and\n      Whereas, Introduction Number 670, introduced in the New York City Council in 2022, would create a local camera enforcement program involving the installation of cameras on streets sweepers to photograph and report parking violations; and\n      Whereas, Subdivision 2 of section 238 of the New York State (NYS) Vehicle and Traffic Law requires a notice of violation relating to the adjudication of parking violations to be served personally upon the operator of a motor vehicle in the absence of state authorization in specific cases; and\n      Whereas, The NYS Legislature has passed legislation allowing service by first-class mail of notices of violation in connection with camera enforcement programs relating to red light speeding, school zone speeding, and bus lane traffic violations; and\n      Whereas, NYS legislation to allow service by first-class mail of notices of violations issued pursuant to an NYC-created street sweeper camera enforcement program relating to parking would greatly enhance the effectiveness of such a program; and \n      Whereas, There is no current NYS legislation pertaining to the installation of cameras on street sweepers in NYC, and the last pieces of NYS legislation addressing this topic, A.8533, introduced by former NYS Assembly Member Brian Kavanagh, and companion bill S.5536, were introduced in 2011 and since then have languished in committee; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the New York State Legislature to amend New York State law to allow for service by first-class mail of notices of violations issued pursuant to any street sweeper camera enforcement program relating to parking established by New York City law.\n\nEH\nLS #14851\n12/20/2023 10:42 AM\n\n\n\n2",
