  "Text": "Whereas, The Older Americans Act (OAA), which was enacted by the United States (U.S.) Congress in 1965 in response to concern about a lack of community social services for older adults, established authority for grants to states for community planning and social services, research and development projects, and personnel training in the field of aging; and\n      Whereas, The OAA also established the Administration on Aging, which is the principal agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services designated to administer grant programs and to serve as the federal focal point on matters concerning older adults; and\n      Whereas, Today, the OAA supports a wide range of social services and programs for older individuals defined as aged 60 years or older; and\n      Whereas, These include supportive services; congregate nutrition services, such as meals served at group sites such as senior centers, community centers, schools, churches, or senior housing complexes; home-delivered nutrition services; family caregiver support; the long-term care ombudsman program; and services to prevent the abuse, neglect, and exploitation of older adults; and\n      Whereas, Title V of the OAA, the Community Service Senior Opportunities Act, also known as Community Service Employment for Older Americans or the Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP), provides part-time opportunities in community service activities for unemployed low-income individuals aged 55 and older who have poor employment prospects; and\n      Whereas, The lowered age threshold to qualify for SCSEP suggests special consideration made in light of the workforce challenges, including age-related discrimination or the need for updated skills to remain employable, that those close to traditional retirement age may face; and\n      Whereas, Individuals living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (\"AIDS\") have an increased risk for a number of health complications typically associated with aging; and\n      Whereas, While antiretroviral therapy for HIV treatment regimens today are generally easy to administer, safe, and well-tolerated, initial protocols were associated with significant short-term and long-term adverse effects; and\n      Whereas, These include cancer, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and other end-organ diseases, while the most persistent issues are immunologic abnormalities consistent with some of the changes to the adaptive immune system that are typical among much older adults, or immunosenescence, which is likely related to persistent inflammation; and\n      Whereas, The apparent \"accelerated or premature aging\" of long-term treated patients likely reflects complications characterized by increased burden of comorbid diseases, higher rates of behavioral risk factors, antiretroviral treatment toxicity, and chronic inflammation; and\n      Whereas, As of December 2020, according to New York State (NYS) Department of Health data, there were 105,610 living with HIV in NYS, of which 55,779 (or 57 percent) were aged 50 and older; and\n      Whereas, In New York City (\"NYC\" or \"City\"), services and programming designed to meet the needs and concerns of older adults living with HIV/AIDS are limited; and\n      Whereas, Special consideration should be made in light of the health challenges, including \"accelerated or premature aging,\" that individuals living with HIV face; and\n      Whereas, Individuals living with HIV deserve access to more social services and programs; now, therefore, be it\n\tResolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the United States Congress to pass, and the President to sign, legislation to lower the age of eligibility for Older Americans Act-supported social services and programs from 60 to 45 years for individuals living with HIV.\n\nLS #15227\n12/19/2023\nCGR\n3",
