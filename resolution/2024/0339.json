  "Text": "Whereas, According to MergerWatch, an advocacy group that focuses on patient rights during hospital mergers, between 1997 and 2018 over 40 hospitals across New York State closed for inpatient services, and of these, 15 were in New York City (City); and\n      Whereas, Most recently, Mount Sinai, one of the City's largest health systems with eight hospital campuses and a revenue of over $11.3 billion announced plans to close its Beth Israel hospital located in Lower Manhattan by July 2024, and New York State is planning to downsize or close State University of New York (SUNY) Downstate hospital in East Flatbush; and\n      Whereas, Hospital closures have immediate and longer-term impacts on their local communities in terms of health equity, access to care, and the local workforce; and\n \tWhereas, SUNY Downstate is a safety-net hospital obligated to provide care to all patients regardless of insurance status and has the only kidney transplant program in Brooklyn; and\n      Whereas, Mount Sinai Beth Israel primarily treats lower-income patients; and\n      Whereas, A community-led Health Equity Impact Assessment (HEIA) carried out by the Community Coalition to Save Beth Israel and New York Eye and Ear Infirmary found that the majority (80%) of patients went to Beth Israel for emergency care, and 77% chose the hospital because it is closest to where they live; and\n      Whereas, Closure of hospitals such as Beth Israel and SUNY Downstate would result in a loss of access to emergency treatment, specialty medical services, and continuity of care for the surrounding community while putting additional strain on nearby hospitals who will be forced to absorb newly displaced patients; and\n      Whereas, In addition to negative impacts for patients, as hospitals are some of the largest employers in a community, closures can result in significant job loss; and\n      Whereas, According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, support occupations including orderlies, nursing assistants, healthcare support workers, social workers, community health workers, security workers, food preparation and service workers, janitors, cleaners, groundskeepers, housekeepers, childcare workers, cashiers, file clerks, and maintenance workers make up a third of all jobs in General Medical and Surgical Hospitals; and\n      Whereas, In calendar year 2023, per data from the New York State Department of Labor, there were an average of 360,000 people employed in General and Surgical Hospitals in New York State, of which 43%, or over 159,000, worked in New York City; and\n      Whereas, Currently, facilities that have plans to close must receive approval from the New York State Department of Health (DOH) and Director of the Center for Health Care Quality and Surveillance, but community input, via a community forum, is only required by the New York Public Health Law after the hospital has already closed; and\n      Whereas, S.2085, introduced by New York State Senator Brian Kavanagh and pending in the State Senate, and companion bill A.1633, introduced by New York State Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon and pending in the State Assembly, also known as the Local Input in Community Healthcare (LICH) Act, seeks to amend the New York Public Health Law such that the New York State Commissioner of Health could only approve a hospital closure after determining the needs of the community and other impacted stakeholders; and\n      Whereas, The LICH Act would also require hospitals seeking closure to produce a closure plan informed by a community input process and including the impact of the closure on the surrounding community including the underserved and uninsured, and measures and recommendations to mitigate negative consequences; and\n      Whereas, Stakeholder consultations and the development of a closure plan focused on real impacts will improve transparency, promote community engagement and empowerment, and could help prevent the loss of critical access to healthcare for underserved communities by identifying both alternatives and instances where an existing facility is vital and cannot be safely closed; and\n      Whereas, As hospitals in New York State are certified nonprofits licensed by the State to serve the needs of their communities, it is imperative that impacted stakeholders be consulted and their voices heard before a hospital is permitted to close; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the New York State Legislature to Pass, and the Governor to Sign, S.2085/A.1633, the Local Input in Community Healthcare Act.\n \n \nPR\nLS # 15633\n2/15/2024\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2",
