Flake have done at GAC over almost five decades, GAC has grown in membership to more than 23,000, making it the largest congregation in the African Methodist Episcopal (A.M.E.) Church; and\n      Whereas, In addition to the religious work of GAC, the Reverend Drs. Flake founded the private Allen Christian School, the Allen Women's Resource Center, which houses victims of domestic violence, and the Soup Kitchen and Feeding Program, which distributes over 105,000 meals and bags of food weekly; and\n      Whereas, GAC also has served the greater community through its commercial and residential developments and as one of the largest private sector employers in Queens; and\n      Whereas, When Pastor Emeritus Flake became a United States (U.S.) Representative in 1986, he went on to serve his community in Congress for a decade by championing legislation to support urban development, including his Bank Enterprise Act, which provided incentives for lending institutions to invest in communities like his, and by bringing federal resources home to Queens, including a regional Federal Drug Administration facility and a regional Federal Aviation Administration facility; and\n      Whereas, The Reverend Drs. Flake co-authored two books, Practical Virtues: Everyday Values and Devotions for African American Families and African American Church Management Handbook; and\n      Whereas, Pastor Elaine also authored God in Her Midst: Preaching Healing to Hurting Women and contributed to The Women of Color Study Bible and Souls of My Sisters: Black Women Break Their Silence, Tell Their Stories, and Heal Their Spirits; and \n      Whereas, Pastor Emeritus Flake also co-authored The Way of the Bootstrapper: Nine Action Steps for Achieving Your Dreams, with Donna Marie Williams; and\n      Whereas, Pastor Emeritus Flake was honored in 2020 by the New York City Council by co-naming a portion of Merrick Boulevard in Queens as Floyd H.

Flake have been married for almost half a century and are the parents of Aliya, Nailah, Robert Rasheed, and Harold Hasan and the grandparents of Nia Renee; and \n      Whereas, In a 2014 interview in The Christian Post, Pastor Emeritus Flake perhaps summed up his own career, saying that \"[t]he bottom line comes when you're in a community and you see all of the possibilities and the promise that it has and you see some levels of deterioration, I do believe that you cannot stay in your church and merely preach to people on a Sunday morning\"; and\n      Whereas, The designation of a day to honor the Reverend Drs. Flake, who did not simply stay in their church, as impressive an institution as they have helped it to become, but rather reached out into their community in a thousand ways to serve those in need and to improve community life economically, politically, and socially; now, therefore, be it\n\tResolved, That the Council of the City of New York designates the first Sunday in June annually as Flake Legacy Day in the City of New York to recognize the spiritual, educational, civic, and economic contributions of the Reverend Drs.
