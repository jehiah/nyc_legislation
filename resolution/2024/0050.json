  "Text": "Whereas, The Federal Child Tax Credit (child tax credit) was established as part of the Taxpayer Relief Act in 1997 and helps qualifying families with children to get a tax break; and\n      Whereas, As originally passed in 1997, the child tax credit was $400 per child under age 17 and nonrefundable for most families; and\n      Whereas, Since 1997, the benefit has been expanded and made more available to more low-income families, while the value of the child tax credit has also been increased; and \n      Whereas, The value of the child tax credit is determined primarily by the income level, marital status, and number of dependent children, according to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS); and\n      Whereas, It is estimated  that the child tax credit lifts nearly 2 million children out of poverty each year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures; and \n      Whereas, More recently, another piece of federal legislation - the American Rescue Plan (Plan) - was enacted in 20201 during a public health and economic crisis to provide further economic relief to children expanding the child tax credit that has kept millions of children out of poverty, according to the United States (US) Department of Treasury; and\n      Whereas, the Plan increased the child tax credit for qualifying children under age 6 from up to $2,000 per child to up to $3,600 per child; and\n      Whereas, The Plan increased the child tax credit for qualifying children between ages 6 and 16 from up to $2,000 per child to up to $3,000 per child; and\n      Whereas, Between July and December 2021, the IRS paid out six months of advance child tax credit payments worth up to $250 per child ages 6 to 17, and up to $300 per child under age 6, impacting over 61 million children in over 36 million households; and\n      Whereas, The Columbia Center on Poverty and Social Policy estimated that in July 2021, when the first monthly checks went out, the US child poverty rate dropped to 11.9 percent, from 15.8 percent the month before, the lowest rate on record since 1960; and \n      Whereas, The monthly child tax credit kept 3 million children from poverty in July 2021, and by December 2021, was keeping 3.7 million children from poverty and reducing monthly child poverty by 30 percent; and\n      Whereas, The IRS sent the last round of 2021 child tax credit payments in December 2021, which marked the last month that families received an advance payment; and\n      Whereas, the Plan only guaranteed the increased child tax credit for the 2021 tax year, and they accordingly reverted in 2022 to the previous rules of  $2,000 per child after Congress failed to extend the plan; and \n      Whereas, Food insecurity in the US has worsened since the monthly children tax credit payments ended in December 2021, and the Census Bureau has since estimated that more than 21 million Americans are food insecure; and  \n      Whereas, The child tax credit expansions have been projected to reduce annual child poverty by more than 40 percent, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP); and \n      Whereas, Poverty and the hardships that come with it, such as unstable housing, frequent moves, inadequate nutrition, and high levels of family stress can take a heavy toll on children and are associated with lower levels of educational attainment, poorer health outcomes, and lower earnings, according to a 2019 report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine; and\n      Whereas, According to CBPP, an estimated 9.9 million children are at risk of slipping back below the poverty line or deeper into poverty if the expansion is not extended, including 3.8 million Latino, 2.9 million white, 2.1 million Black, 426,000 Asian, and 280,000 American Indian or Alaska Native (AIAN) children; and \n      Whereas, The child tax credit expansion will help reduce racial disparities and discrimination, which have created large gaps in both opportunities and outcomes in education, employment, health, and housing, according to CBPP; and \n      Whereas, Studies show that without the expansion, the differences in child poverty rates between Latino and white children would grow by 70 percent, between Black and white children by 78 percent, and between AIAN and white children by 86 percent according to CBPP; and \n      Whereas, Expanding the child tax credits through 2025 would already have significantly lowered child poverty and lifted more than 4 million children from living in poverty, according to the Urban Institute; and\n      Whereas, Making the child tax credit available on a permanent basis to would lower poverty rates for children, improve children's lives, and benefit all of society; now, therefore, be it \n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the United States Congress to reinstate and make the Child Tax Credit permanent.\n\nSession 13\nLS # 7852\n01/17/2024\n\nSession 12\nVM\n7/25/2022\nLS 7852",
