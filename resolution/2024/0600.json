  "Text": "Whereas, Society recognizes that gun ownership comes with significant responsibility, and to exercise this responsibility effectively, an individual must possess a certain level of maturity; and\n      Whereas, Current federal law restricts licensed dealers from selling handguns to individuals under age 21 and long guns to those under age 18, but allows unlicensed individuals to sell handguns to those as young as 18; and\n      Whereas, Research shows that the prefrontal cortex, the brain's decision-making center, continues to develop until age 25, meaning individuals under 25 are more prone to impulsive decisions, which, when combined with easy access to firearms, can lead to catastrophic outcomes; and\n      Whereas, According to the RAND Corporation individuals under age 21 are disproportionately involved in firearm-related crimes and incidents, both as perpetrators and victims of firearm-related injuries and deaths, including suicides and homicides, compared to older age groups; and\n      Whereas, The presence of firearms in homes, along with perceived ease of access to firearms by youths, call into question the effectiveness of current federal minimum age gun laws; and\n      Whereas, Many states have implemented stricter minimum age requirements for firearm purchases and possession, yet gaps remain in federal law that allow for inconsistencies and potential exploitation, according to Everytown for Gun Safety; and\n      Whereas, Raising the minimum age for all firearm purchases to 21 aligns with evidence suggesting that this policy change could help reduce firearm-related injuries and deaths by restricting access to all firearms, including handguns and long guns; and\n      Whereas, The US Supreme Court, in DC v. Heller (2008), affirmed that Second Amendment rights are not unlimited, allowing for reasonable restrictions on firearm access, including age limits, which are especially reasonable given the impulsiveness of those under 21; and\n      Whereas, Setting the minimum age for all firearm purchases at 21 at the federal level will address a critical gap in current gun laws, improve national public safety, and align with existing restrictions on other potentially dangerous behaviors for individuals under 21. It represents a necessary and evidence-based step to protect young people and the broader community from the dangers of gun violence; now, therefore, be it \n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the United States Congress to pass and the President to sign a law to set minimum age to buy all firearms from licensed dealers or private individuals at 21.\n\nCMB\nLS#17404\n9/12/24",
