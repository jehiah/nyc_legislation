Gary Pretlow and pending in the New York State Assembly, would make it easier for skilled stylists and those from diverse cultural backgrounds to apply for the license by streamlining the requirements for experienced braiders to document prior experience; and \n      Whereas, At the same time, S.8573/A.8624-A would expand the educational requirements for natural hair care and braiding specialists by adding modules on infection and bacteriology, alopecia and scalp disorders and diseases, salon health and safety protocols and the science of sanitary practices; and\n      Whereas, S.8573/A.8624-A would establish an apprenticeship program for trainees to learn from licensed natural hair styling professionals during their course of study; now, therefore, be it, \n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.8573/A.8624-A, in relation to the practice of natural hair care and braiding.\n      \n      \n\n\nNEM\nLS 16505\n5/7/2024\n1",
