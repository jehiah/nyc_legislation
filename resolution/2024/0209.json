  "Text": "Whereas, In 2021, New York State's (NYS) electric grid was comprised of approximately 30% renewable generation resources, with approximately 4% provided by wind and 2.5% solar assets statewide; and\n      Whereas, Environmental advocates have expressed concerns that there are insufficient renewable projects in the pipeline to meet the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act's (CLCPA) mandated target of 70% renewable energy by 2030, and a zero emission grid by 2040; and\n      Whereas, In New York City, electricity is largely generated via the combustion of fossil fuels, with approximately 85% of the electric supply sourced from fossil-fuel combustion plants in 2021, compared to upstate, where only 12% is sourced from fossil-fuel combustion plants and 88% of the electricity is supplied via renewable generation; and\n      Whereas, The New York City Mayor's Office of Climate and Environmental Justice has acknowledged that the City must maximize the use of renewables within the city, and increase transmission from clean power sources outside the city, in order to meet the CLCPA mandated goal of an 100% zero emissions grid by 2040; and \n      Whereas, The New York Power Authority (NYPA) is the largest public utility in the country, providing approximately 25% of New York's energy, around 80% of which is renewable hydroelectric power, the most affordable source of energy available in NYS; and\n      Whereas, The NYPA is currently barred by its charter from owning more than six generation projects over 25 megawatts; and\n      Whereas, A.1382, introduced by NYS Assembly Member Robert Carroll, and S.3032, introduced by NYS Senator Kevin Parker, would empower the NYPA to own new renewable energy generation facilities; and\n      Whereas, The State bill would give the NYPA the right of first offer and refusal for acquiring any renewable generational facility; and \n      Whereas, A.1326, introduced by NYS Assembly Member Robert Carroll, and S.1978, introduced by NYS Senator Robert Jackson, would establish a downstate New York Power Authority to own and operate electricity services and acquire the distribution facilities formerly owned by any downstate utility corporation by purchase or condemnation; and \n      Whereas, In New York City, Consolidated Edison of New York (ConEd) holds a virtual monopoly over the electricity market, serving all parts of New York City (except for Rockaway, Queens), and Westchester County; and\n      Whereas, ConEd is an investor-owned for-profit company that answers to its shareholders, not solely the general public in New York City and Westchester; and\n      Whereas, Publicly-owned and operated utilities are governed by and operate for the sole benefit of the public; and\n      Whereas, Public power systems can perform equal to, if not better than, private power systems in reliability; and\n      Whereas, According to the American Public Power Association, public power customers are likely to be without power for an average of 62 minutes per year, compared to 150 minutes per year for private utility customers, provided there are no major adverse events; and\n      Whereas, According to the American Public Power Association, residential customers of public power utilities pay monthly bills that are on average 4% less than customers of investor-owned utilities; and\n      Whereas, New York City needs a reliable electricity provider that is fully accountable to the public to ensure the safety and economic health of the city; and\n      Whereas, To confront the climate crisis, NYS must take further action to ensure its energy needs are met through the generation of renewable energy; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the calling upon the New York State Legislature to pass, and Governor to sign, A.1326/S.1978 and A.1382/S.3032, to promote a more sustainable and equitable energy system in New York State.\n\n\nSession 13\nLS #5162\n01/17/2024\n\nSession 12\nLS 5162\nNM\n7/29/22",
