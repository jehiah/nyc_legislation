  "Text": "Whereas, Observed annually on May 28 since 2013, Menstrual Hygiene Day is a global advocacy initiative aimed at raising awareness about menstrual hygiene management, promoting access to menstrual hygiene products, and breaking the stigma surrounding menstruation; and\n      Whereas, Menstrual hygiene plays a crucial role in the overall health, well-being, and empowerment of individuals who menstruate; and\n      Whereas, Lack of access to menstrual hygiene products and inadequate knowledge about menstrual health can lead to adverse health outcomes and perpetuate gender inequality; and\n      Whereas, According to a 2022 Journal of Global Health report, an estimated 500 million people in the United States lack access to adequate menstrual products; and\n      Whereas, Additionally, 16.9 million menstruating people live in poverty, two-thirds of whom reported not being able to afford menstrual hygiene products in the past year, and half of whom had to choose between menstrual products and food; and\n      Whereas, This lack of period supplies, commonly referred to as period poverty, can have adverse effects on individuals' health and well-being; and\n      Whereas, According to Alliance for Period Supplies, in New York, 4,235,336, or 1 in 6 women and girls between ages 12 and 44, live below the federal poverty line and are potentially experiencing period poverty; and \n      Whereas, Nationally, 1 in 4  teens reported missing school while 1 in 5 low-income women reported missing work, school, or similar obligations due to the challenges associated with period poverty; and\n      Whereas, Individuals experiencing period poverty may resort to using products longer than they are intended or utilize makeshift alternatives like socks or toilet paper, risking urogenital infections like urinary tract infection, bacterial vaginosis, and in rare occasions, toxic shock syndrome, compromising their health; and\n      Whereas, Period poverty is also linked to higher rates of depression, as a 2021 study on the impact of period poverty on college-aged women in the United States found that out of 471 participants, 68.1% experienced moderate to severe depression; and\n      Whereas, Period poverty perpetuates the cycle of poverty by forcing menstruators to disengage from daily life, resulting in lost wages and missed educational opportunities; and\n      Whereas, Easy access to period products for students and low-income individuals reduces disruptions to their education and jobs, which enhances their ability to actively participate in daily activities while increasing their quality of life; and\n      Whereas, In recognition of these issues, during the 2021- 2022 session, Congresswoman Grace Meng of NY-6, introduced H. Res. 1145, which called to nationally recognize and observe May 28 as Menstrual Hygiene Day to raise awareness of menstrual hygiene and access to menstrual health management; and\n      Whereas, While H. Res. 1145 is yet to be reintroduced during the current session,  dedicating May 28 as Menstrual Hygiene Day in New York City would provide an opportunity to highlight the importance of menstrual hygiene, educate the public, and mobilize efforts to address the challenges faced by individuals who menstruate; and\n      Whereas, This dedicated day shall serve as an opportunity for educational campaigns, community engagement, and advocacy activities aimed at raising awareness about menstrual hygiene management, promoting access to menstrual products, and fostering a supportive and inclusive environment for individuals who menstruate; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York declares May 28 as Menstrual Hygiene Day in the City of New York.\n\n\nLS #13049\n5/08/2024\nMB",
