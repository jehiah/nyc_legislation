and\n      Whereas, A number of programs in New York offer assistance to older adults and disabled persons to address rent increases and property taxes; and\n      Whereas, The Senior Citizen Rent Increase Exemption (SCRIE) and the Disability Rent Increase Exemption (DRIE) help eligible persons aged 62 years and older and eligible tenants with disabilities, respectively, to remain in affordable housing by freezing their rent, with their landlords receiving a property tax credit to cover the difference between the increased and the original rent amount; and \n      Whereas, To be eligible for SCRIE or DRIE, a tenant's combined annual household income has to be $50,000 or less; and \n      Whereas, However, per the Economic Policy Institute's Family Budget Calculator, a household of one adult and no children needs an annual income of $56,718 in 2020 dollars to attain a modest, yet adequate standard of living in the New York Metropolitan Area;

and\n      Whereas, Moreover, the U.S. Social Security Administration implements an annual cost-of-living adjustment, based on the Consumer Price Index, to Social Security and Supplemental Security Income benefits to ensure that the purchasing power of benefits is not eroded by inflation; and\n      Whereas, For example, Social Security and Supplemental Security Income benefits were increased by 5.9 percent in January 2022 and by 8.7 percent in January 2023; and\n      Whereas, Given that an applicant's income calculations for SCRIE, DRIE, SCHE, and DHE include Social Security benefits, and income calculations for SCRIE and DRIE additionally incorporate Supplemental Security Income benefits, a cost-of-living adjustment to these benefits could render an otherwise eligible tenant or homeowner ineligible for rent freezing or a property tax exemption, thereby placing the person at risk of housing displacement and homelessness; and\n      Whereas, With the aim of ensuring that older adults and disabled persons are not displaced from their homes, and that many more people are able to benefit from SCRIE, DRIE, SCHE, and DHE, State Senator Brian Kavanagh introduced S.2960 in the New York State Senate, and Assembly Member Deborah J. Glick introduced companion bill A.5741 in the New York State Assembly, which would provide for annual adjustment of the maximum income threshold for eligibility for SCRIE, DRIE, SCHE, and DHE by any increase in the Consumer Price Index; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.2960/A.5741, to provide for annual adjustment of the maximum income threshold eligibility for the Senior Citizen Rent Increase Exemption (SCRIE), Disability Rent Increase Exemption (DRIE), Senior Citizen Homeowners' Exemption (SCHE), and Disabled Homeowners' Exemption (DHE) by any increase in the Consumer Price Index.\n\nSession 13\nLS # 13642\n01/23/2024\n\nSession 12\nLS #13642\n08/24/2023\nAZ \n2",
