The Proposed City Fiscal Year 2025 Community Development Program, Proposed Reallocation of Fiftieth Year Community Development Funds, and Proposed Fifty-First Year Community Development Program were submitted by the Mayor to the Council on April 24, 2024 and referred to the Committee on Finance.  \n\nAnalysis.  The Committee on Finance held hearings on the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 13th, 14th, 15th, 17th, 20th, 21st, and 22nd of May 2024. The testimony elicited at these hearings regarding the budget as a whole and with respect to specific needs and projects was supplemented by further data developed at the meetings of the Committee on Finance, and from Council staff and representatives of City agencies. The primary concern of the Committee was that the funding contained in the Proposed City Fiscal Year 2025 Community Development Program would meet the actual and perceived needs of the communities the City of New York comprises.\n\nIn its deliberations, the Committee on Finance took into consideration the testimony of the citizenry at the public hearings and the information furnished by Council Members, staff assistants, and City agencies.\n\nAs a result of the Committee on Finance's deliberation, the Committee recommends the following: \n\n1. A City Fiscal Year 2025 Community Development Program totaling $237,202,000; and\n2. A Reallocated Fiftieth Year Community Development Program totaling $236,014,000; and \n3. A Fifty-First Community Development Program totaling $238,062,000.\n\nThe Committee makes this recommendation with the stipulation that the portion of the Fifty-First  Year Community Development budget, which will be spent in City Fiscal Year 2026 and not City Fiscal Year 2025, will be subject to review and reallocation in the City Fiscal Year 2026 Community Development budget.\n\n\nCommunity Development Block Grant (CDBG)-Additional Funding\n(Dollars in Millions)\nCOMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM\nPROPOSED BUDGET\nPROPOSED CHANGES \nREVISED BUDGET\n \n \n \n \nCity Fiscal Year 2025 Community Development Program Total:\n236.802 \n0.400 \n237.202 \nReallocated Fiftieth Year Community Development Program Total:\n235.814 \n0.200 \n236.014 \nFifty-First Year Community Development Program Total:\n238.037 \n0.025 \n238.062 \n\n\nThe proposed changes to the City Fiscal Year 2025 Community Development Program Total are comprised of the following:\n1) The addition of $0.375 for the Met Council Food Pantry, administered through the Department of Youth and Community Development.  Community Development Block Grant funds will pay for a food distribution program targeting low- and moderate-income residents in New York City. Funds are expected to pay for the administrative staff and for food.\n2) The addition of $0.025 for collective bargaining and fringe for some smaller collective bargaining units. \n\nThe proposed changes to Chart 2 are comprised of approximately half of the above changes because CD 50 supports the first half of CFY 2025.\nThe proposed change to Chart 3 is the collective bargaining and fringe for the smaller collective bargaining units. \nFinally, in Calendar Year 2024, the following programs will continue to spend funds that were allocated in prior years (in millions):\n* Inspections in City Shelters: $.165\n* Project Open House: $.075\n* Public Housing Rehabilitation Program: $39.442\n* Recreation Services Planning: $.474",
