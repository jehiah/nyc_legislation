Carter Specialty Hospital and Nursing Facility and who will become homeless or will be at risk of becoming homeless upon discharge and referred by the Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC); and Applicants referred by the Administration for Children's Services (ACS) under the Independent Living or Family Unification programs; and \n      Whereas, Although homeless families and individuals are at the highest priority level, the referral requirement by a City agency, such as DHS, HPD, HASA, HHC or ACS, creates barriers for those who are in desperate need of housing; and \n      Whereas, According to DHS, on January 12, 2023, 70,525 people slept in a DHS shelter, of which included 22,419 children; and \n      Whereas, According to daily data tracked by City Limits, this number represents an all-time high, and is up more than 51% since Mayor Eric Adams took office at the start of 2022; and \n      Whereas, As the number of individuals experiencing homelessness in New York City increases, public housing is needed more than ever and barriers to entry, such as referrals by City agencies, only restrict those who need housing the most from getting it; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the New York City Housing Authority to change its priority preference for housing to automatically place families and individuals experiencing homelessness at the highest priority level.\n\n\n\n\nSession 13\nKK\nLS #12107\n01/18/2024\n\nSession 12\nKK\nLS #12107\n2/24/23",
