City of New York (Nunez) was a class action lawsuit from 2015 that resulted in a consent decree that requires DOC to implement specific policies and practices overseen by a court-appointed monitor; and \n      Whereas, Pursuant to the Nunez settlement, the court-appointed monitor issues a progress report on the DOC's practices of use of force every six months; and \n      Whereas, The Special Report of the Nunez Monitor Steve J. Martin detailed imminent risk of harm to both incarcerated individuals and city jail staff noting DOC's failure to implement reforms outlined in the September 2021 remedial order and that the staffing crisis was ongoing; and\n       Whereas, According to the New York Post, at the peak of the ongoing staffing crisis, one in five correction workers did not show up for work because they claimed to be sick which created dangerous and chaotic conditions under which incarcerated individuals assaulted each other and fatally overdosed; and \n      Whereas, Manhattan US Attorney Damien Williams representing the United States as a plaintiff-intervenor in Nunez stated in a legal filing to federal court in 2022 that previous attempts to fix the notorious lockup have failed miserably and that aggressive relief through a federal receiver with independent authority to implement reforms in compliance with the consent judgement, remedial orders, and monitor recommendations could be needed; and \n      Whereas, The DOC submitted a 30 page action plan proposal in defense of itself being best suited to revamp its troubled jail system in opposition to being placed under the control of a federal receiver to presiding Chief Laura Taylor Swain; and \n      Whereas, the DOC proposal outlines timelines for restructuring DOC's leadership, cracking down on absenteeism, expediting disciplinary cases of uniformed officers, and dealing with other issues plaguing NYC lockups; and \n      Whereas, Nunez monitor Martin, and the Legal Aid Society represented to Judge Swain that the proposal was still filled with holes and especially took exception with NYC's refusal to look outside the DOC for better candidates to run its jails; and \n      Whereas, Martin, in a letter to Judge Swain noted that decades of mismanagement still raise serious concerns about whether the DOC is capable of fully and faithfully implementing its Action Plan with integrity by addressing the danger, violence, and chaos that continue to occur daily; and \n      Whereas, The Legal Aid Society expressed to Judge Swain they are worried the city plan will not address the ongoing harm caused by the dysfunctional jails and that they plan to formally move for contempt, asserting that officials who came up through the system aren't equipped to fix it, and request a federal receivership take control of Rikers Island; and \n      Whereas, On June 15, 2022 Chief Judge Swain ruled that DOC's action plan was sufficient, citing the action plan as a way to move forward with concrete measures to address the ongoing crisis at Rikers Island taking federal receivership off the table until at least the fall of 2022; and \n      Whereas, Federal receivership is a designation that would give sweeping powers to an independent authority tasked with finally ending violence on Rikers Isalnd as it has helped remedy entrenched problems at other lockups nationwide such prison systems for Alabama, The District of Columbia, Chicago, California, and Wayne County in Michigan; and \n      Whereas, Only a non-partisan receiver appointed by the Federal Court can suspend laws, regulations, and contracts, including a collective bargaining agreement, that interfere with the implementation of the consent decree, and in correcting the things that the court determined are in need of correction; and \n      Whereas, A federal receiver answers only to the Court and must publish their findings to ensure transparency and at sustained success turn over power back to the city; and now, therefore, be it \n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the President of the United States to immediately place New York City jails in federal receivership\n\nSession 13\nLS #10110\n01/18/2024\n\nSession 12\nCMB\nLS #10110\n09/28/22",
