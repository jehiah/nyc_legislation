  "Text": "Whereas, There are thousands of commercial helicopter flights over New York City each month; and\n      Whereas, Helicopter-related noise complaints to New York City's 3-1-1 increased from 10,359 in 2020 to 25,821 in 2021 with a vast majority of the complaints coming from Manhattan; and\n      Whereas, Over the past five years, 3-1-1 has experienced a 2,329% increase in noise complaints related to helicopters; and\n      Whereas, According to numerous health publications, exposure to excessive noise produced by frequent overhead flights are associated with a number of health effects, including, but not limited to: (i) high blood pressure; (ii) neuroendocrinological issues; (iii) impaired psychological and cognitive functions; (iv) learned helplessness; (v) poorer long-term memory; and (iv) diminished reading comprehension; and\n      Whereas, Many national and municipal organizations, such as Stop the Chop NY/NJ, create  public educational campaigns on the dangers to health and the environment that can be caused by non-essential helicopter sightseeing tours and commuter flights that fly over our City; and\n      Whereas, In an effort to mitigate the impact of the non-essential commercial flights on public health and the environment, A.7638-A, which was introduced by New York State Assemblymember Robert C. Carroll, and companion bill S.7216-A, which was introduced by New York State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, seek to amend the New York State Tax Law by establishing a noise tax on non-essential helicopter and seaplane flights in cities with a population of one million or more; and \n      Whereas, Pursuant to A.7638-A/S.7216-A, the tax rate on such aircrafts would be fifty dollars per seat ticket, or two hundred dollars per flight, whichever is greater; and \n      Whereas, Under A.7638-A/S.7216-A, flight operators who fail to pay this tax due to willful neglect would subject to a penalty of four hundred percent of the total tax amount due; and\n      Whereas, A.7638-A/S.7216-A, would mandate that all funds collected under this new tax be deposited in New York State's Environmental Protection Fund; and\n      Whereas, The New York State Senate passed S.7216 on June 8, 2023 and was delivered to the Assembly on the same day; and \n      Whereas, Enacting A.7638-A/S.7216-A would help reduce noise pollution from the plethora of non-essential aircrafts that affect the millions of residents in our great City; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, A.7638-A/S.7216-A, which would establish a noise tax on non-essential helicopter and seaplane flights in cities with a population of one million or more. \n\n\nWJH\nLS 15031\n1/3/24",
