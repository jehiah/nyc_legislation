  "Text": "Whereas, According to the New York City (NYC) Department of Transportation (DOT), each year about 365 million tons of cargo enters, leaves, or passes through NYC, with about 89 percent of it being carried by truck; and\n\tWhereas, The NYC DOT estimates that by 2045, the tonnage of cargo within the City is expected to increase by 68 percent, to 540 million tons, with the same proportion (89 percent) expected to be delivered by truck; and\n\tWhereas, As of March 2022, the total number of daily packages delivered to NYC is about 3.6 million; and\n\tWhereas, The United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) and New York State Department of Motor Vehicles (NYSDMV) each have their own vehicle requirements and regulations for the operation of commercial motor vehicles; and\n\tWhereas, Having different vehicle mirror requirements for interstate and intrastate commerce could make the commercial delivery process confusing and cumbersome in the State of New York; and\n\tWhereas, The USDOT's Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's (FMCSA) regulations require that each bus, truck, and truck-tractor be equipped with 2 rear-vision mirrors, 1 at each side; and\n\t Whereas, FMCSA has granted certain exemptions to allow motor carriers to operate commercial motor vehicles that are equipped with specific digital mirror systems instead of 2 rear-vision mirrors as required by their regulations; and\n\tWhereas, These digital mirror systems consist of 3 cameras, each with a specific field of view, firmly mounted to the top of the vehicle, and presenting a clear image to the driver by means of an internal monitor firmly mounted to the structural member between the windshield and the door of the motor vehicles cab; and \n\tWhereas, According to FMCSA, although no State may enforce any law or regulation applicable to interstate commerce that conflicts with or is inconsistent with FMCSA's regulation exemption, States may, but are not required to, adopt the same exemption with respect to operation in intrastate commerce; and\n\tWhereas, The NYSDMV requires that every commercial vehicle be equipped with a mirror or other reflecting device and an outside rear-view mirror mounted on the driver's side of the vehicle, and does not permit the use of any alternatives to mirrors or other reflecting devices for intrastate commerce; and \n      Whereas, According to FMCSA, digital mirror systems provide a greater field of vision when compared to standard rear-view mirrors because they eliminate the blind spots on both sides of operating vehicles, provide a monitor with a low light sensitivity sensor, and include a camera heating system, all which exceed current requirements; and\n      Whereas, FMCSA has determined that granting the exemption to allow these digital mirror systems would likely achieve a level of safety equivalent to or greater than the level of safety provided by the regulation; and  \n      Whereas, Traffic safety measures that potentially exceed current safety regulations could enhance street safety in the City of New York; now, therefore, be it \n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the New York State Legislature to adopt the same exemptions as FMCSA for approved digital mirror systems with respect to operation in intrastate commerce.\nJPB\nLS # 14326\n12/14/2023 4:59 PM\n2",
