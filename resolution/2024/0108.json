Res. 144, sponsored by U.S. Senator Edward J. Markey (D-MA) and H. Res. 269, sponsored by U.S. Representative Pramila Jayapal (D-WA-7), was introduced on March 30, 2023-the International Transgender Day of Visibility-in order to create a comprehensive framework of protections to ensure medical care, shelter, safety and economic security in response to escalating attacks upon the transgender community; and\n\tWhereas, According to the New York State Department of Health, in 2022, New York State was home to over one million adults who identify as LGBTQ+,  with an estimated 0.5% of New York State adults identifying as transgender or gender non-confirming; and\n\tWhereas, According to HRC, the \"epidemic\" of violent incidents targeting the transgender and gender non-conforming community in New York City has resulted in at least 11 fatalities in 2023; now, therefore, be it\n\tResolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon Congress to pass, and the President to sign, S.
