  "Text": "Whereas, According to the International Confederation of Midwives, the definition of a midwife is a recognized, responsible, and accountable professional who, working in partnership with a pregnant person, gives the necessary support, care, and advice during pregnancy, labor, and the postpartum period; and\n      Whereas, The distinctions among professional midwifery credentials in the United States include the Certified Nurse-Midwife (CNM), the Certified Midwife (CM), and the Certified Professional Midwife (CPM), and each credential has its own educational and clinical experience requirements, with varying criteria as to scope of practice and range of care; and\n      Whereas, New York State authorizes both CNMs and CMs to obtain licenses to practice in New York State; and \n      Whereas, CPMs, however, who typically specialize in home care outside of a hospital setting, are currently not licensed under New York State law and, therefore, are not allowed to practice in New York State; and\n      Whereas, According to the New York State Education Department, both CNMs and CMs meet the educational requirements for licensure as a midwife, which include completion of a master's degree program in midwifery or a related field, passing the examination administered by the American Midwifery Certification Board, paying a fee for licensure of $322.00, being of good moral character, and being at least 21 years of age; and\n      Whereas, According to the North American Registry of Midwives, CPMs are at minimum high school graduates or the equivalent, who complete an accredited midwifery educational program that includes both didactic and supervised clinical experience, and have successfully passed a written examination to become a certified CPM; and\n      Whereas,  According to the World Health Organization (WHO), midwifery services reduce maternal mortality and morbidity by providing interventions such as family planning, diabetes management, assisted delivery, and breastfeeding support; and\n      Whereas, The WHO estimates midwife-led interventions could prevent two-thirds of maternal deaths, newborn deaths, and stillbirths, thereby potentially saving 4.3 million people per year by 2035; and\n      Whereas, During the COVID-19 pandemic, then-Governor Andrew Cuomo issued an Executive Order granting out-of-state CPMs who held licenses in good standing permission to practice in New York State; and\n      Whereas, Both advocates and lawmakers agree that in the face of the current maternal healthcare staffing shortages and with at least 20 New York counties currently labeled as \"maternity health care deserts,\" there is an urgent need to increase access to midwife services; and\n      Whereas, S.310-A, introduced by New York State Senator Julia Salazar, and its companion bill A.4819-A introduced by New York State Assembly Member Amy Paulin, would amend the education and public health law in order to create the profession of licensed CPM; and \n      Whereas, According to the New York State Nurses Association, any reduction or elimination of midwife service poses a great risk to black and brown individuals in New York City, who are more likely to suffer poor outcomes in maternal healthcare; and\n      Whereas, According to New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene data, black women in New York City are 9 times more likely than white women to die from a pregnancy; and\n      Whereas, CPMs from other states have successfully practiced in New York during the COVID-19 pandemic and have proven their ability to increase better birthing outcomes for pregnant New Yorkers; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.310-A/A.4819-A, to establish requirements for licensure and practice of Certified Professional Midwifery.\n      \n\n\n\nLS 15885, 15966 \n5/27/24\nCD\n\n\n\n\n2",
