  "Text": "Whereas, Marijuana is a Schedule I substance under the federal Controlled Substances Act, meaning that it has a high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision; and\n      Whereas, Schedule III drugs, substances, or chemicals have a moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence, with abuse potential less than Schedule I and  II drugs; and\n      Whereas, Examples of Schedule I drugs include heroin, LSD, marijuana, ecstasy, methaqualone, and peyote, and examples of Schedule III drugs include Tylenol with codeine, ketamine, anabolic steroids, and testosterone; and\n      Whereas, The classification of marijuana as a Schedule I drug, notwithstanding the lack of recognition of the United States Food and Drug Administration, contradicts its widely recognized therapeutic benefits and growing acceptance for medical use in numerous states; and\n      Whereas, The Biden administration has proposed a landmark change in federal marijuana policy, aiming to reclassify marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act from Schedule I to Schedule III; and\n      Whereas, This proposed reclassification acknowledges the therapeutic benefits of marijuana and its potential as a medication for millions of Americans, according to the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws; and\n      Whereas, Experts argue that marijuana's placement on Schedule I lacked scientific basis and that reclassifying it to Schedule III could alleviate the burden on cannabis companies and align federal regulations with public opinion and medical consensus; and\n      Whereas, Reclassification of marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III could encourage more doctors to recommend its use for medical purposes and could facilitate research into its medical benefits and expand treatment options for patients with various conditions; and\n      Whereas, Aligning federal drug scheduling classifications with scientific evidence and public opinion is essential for effective drug policy and public health; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on Resolution calling on the federal government to reschedule Marijuana as a Schedule III drug.\n      \nCMB\nLS#16856\n5/16/24",
