Chakrabarty, then Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India and Co-Chair of the INFE Advisory Board, wrote that \"[i]ncluding financial education into the school curriculum in an on-going manner would hold the key to making our future generations financially literate\"; and \n      Whereas, According to a 2014 survey by the OECD, almost 20 percent of U.S. 15-year-olds said that they had not learned everyday financial skills, like budgeting and comparison shopping; and \n      Whereas, The Council for Economic Education (CEE) has worked for more than 70 years to \"equip K-12 students with the tools and knowledge of personal finance and economics so that they can make better decisions for themselves, their families, and their communities\"; and\n      Whereas, In its 2022 Survey of the States: Economic and Personal Finance Education in Our Nation's Schools, CEE noted key points made in a series of meetings by industry leaders, including that effective financial education needs to be started at an early age and \"requires both the force of state-level action and the flexibility of community-based implementation\"; and  \n      Whereas, The K-8 Social Studies Framework, developed by the New York State Education Department (NYSED), includes overarching K-8 Social Studies Practices and more detailed grade-level learning objectives that require economics and economic systems to be taught in every grade; and\n      Whereas, The NYSED's K-8 Social Studies Framework includes some, but very little, information about personal financial literacy within the economics that is required to be taught; and  \n      Whereas, The New York City (NYC) Department of Education (DOE) has a K-8 Scope and Sequence for social studies, which is based on relevant national and State standards that make up a comprehensive social studies curriculum; and \n      Whereas, The DOE's K-8 Scope and Sequence for social studies includes economics and economic systems as one of 10 unifying themes as well as an economics unit in every grade; and\n      Whereas, The content of those economics units includes very little about personal financial literacy; and \n      Whereas, DOE teachers might not have sufficient resources to teach about personal financial literacy, especially because it is not focused on in NYSED or DOE curriculum documents, but DOE teachers could teach about personal financial literacy if provided with grade-appropriate materials and professional development; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the New York City Department of Education to require personal financial literacy to be taught in grades K-8, to provide curriculum materials appropriate to each grade level, and to provide relevant professional development for teachers. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLS #739 and #2168\n5/10/2023\nRHP",
