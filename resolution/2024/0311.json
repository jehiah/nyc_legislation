  "Text": "Whereas, America's veterans have made immense sacrifices for our country, which can result in service-connected disabilities that affect their ability to find employment, resulting in financial hardship; and\n      Whereas, Veterans with a service-connected disability encounter many obstacles to finding and maintaining a job, including a lack of understanding or knowledge on the part of employers with respect to disability-related supports and rights; and\n      Whereas, Many states grant former service members with a service-connected disability a property tax abatement to honor their contributions and ease their financial struggle, but the scale and scope of exemptions vary; and\n      Whereas, The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) rates disability on a scale of 0 to 100 percent, rounding off to the nearest 10 percent, with higher percentages correlating to more severe conditions; and\n      Whereas, Permanent and total disability means a veteran has a service-connected condition that the VA has determined will not improve; and\n      Whereas, Temporary 100 percent disability means a veteran has a condition that is fully disabling but not permanent; and\n      Whereas, Individual unemployability is a VA designation for veterans deemed unable to work due to a service-connected disability; and \n      Whereas, 18 states offer a complete property tax exemption on the former service member's primary residence if they have a 100% disability rating, but New York State does not; and\n      Whereas, Currently, New York City (City) offers two types of property tax exemptions to veterans-the Alternative Veterans Exemption and the Eligible Funds Exemption; and\n      Whereas, The Alternative Veterans Exemption reduces the assessed value of the recipient's property before taxes are assessed, if the veteran served during a qualified service period, with an additional reduction if they served in a combat zone; and\n      Whereas, The Eligible Funds Exemption reduces the assessed value of the recipient's property before taxes are assessed and is available to veterans who purchase their homes using \"eligible funds,\" including pensions, bonuses, insurance, and mustering-out pay; and\n      Whereas, While these exemptions acknowledge the contributions of our City's veterans, there is more that the City must do to recognize the challenges of service-disabled veterans; and\n      Whereas, S.2028-A, sponsored by State Senator Joseph Addabbo, and A.2965-A, sponsored by State Assembly Member Stacey Pheffer-Amato, would create an exemption from all taxes imposed upon disabled veterans and their spouses, with a 100 percent service-connected disability; and \n      Whereas, This legislation has already passed the State Senate, however it awaits passage in the State Assembly before reaching the Governor's desk for signature; and\n      Whereas, Policymakers at all levels of government play a role in easing this population's financial strain and transition back to civilian life; and \n      Whereas, For their commendable service and tremendous sacrifice, veterans with a 100 percent service-connected disability are entitled to this benefit; now, therefore be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the New York State Assembly to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.2028-A/A.2965-A, to establish a property tax exemption for veterans with a 100 percent service-connected disability.\nEA\nLS #15373\n3/11/24\n\n\n2",
