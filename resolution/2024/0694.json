  "Text": "Whereas, according to the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), New York State (\"State\") has the largest wealth inequality among all 50 states, with the top 1% earning on average 44.4 times more than the bottom 99%, about $2,202,480 a year to about $49,617 a year; and\n\tWhereas, according to the EPI, New York County (Manhattan Borough) has the second largest wealth inequality among all American counties, with the top 1% earning on average 113.0 times more than the bottom 99%, about $8,983,154 a year to about $79,528 a year; and\n\tWhereas, according to the EPI, the other four boroughs also have large wealth disparities, with Kings County (Brooklyn Borough) seeing the top 1% earn on average 26.5 time more than the bottom 99%, Richmond County (Staten Island Borough) seeing the top 1% earn on average 13.5 times more than the bottom 99%, Queens County seeing the top 1% earn on average 13.3 times more than the bottom 99%, and Bronx County seeing the top 1% earn on average 11.3 times more than the bottom 99%; and\n\tWhereas, according to New York State Community Action Association (NYSCAA), over 2.5 million State residents live in poverty; and\n\tWhereas, according to Columbia University Center on Poverty and Social Policy and the non-profit Robin Hood, 1.5 million adults and 420,000 children live in poverty in New York City (\"City\"), and an additional 33% of all City residents have low incomes, defined as incomes between 100% and 200% of the poverty line; and\n\tWhereas, the poverty threshold is continuing to climb, with the threshold being estimated at $40,288 a year for a family of four in 2021, according to the New York City Poverty Measure 2021, and then being estimated at $43,890 a year for a family of four in 2022, according to the Center on Poverty and Social Policy and Columbia University; and\n\tWhereas, according to the Coalition for the Homeless, 250,000 people were homeless at some point in 2019 in the State, and 85% of all homeless people in the State lived in the City, which \"remains the epicenter of the worst homelessness crisis since the Great Depression\"; and\n\tWhereas, in June 2023, according to the New York Times, more than 100,000 people were living in the City's homeless shelters, a new record; and\n\tWhereas, according to the Office of the New York State Comptroller (OSC), housing costs, which include rent, property taxes, utilities, and furnishings, make up roughly 40% of total household expenditures for a typical family living in the City; and\n\tWhereas, according to the OSC, 1 million households in the City, or 53%, are rent burdened, meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on rent, and of those 1 million households, approximately 600,000, or 60%, were severely rent burdened, meaning they spend over 50% of their income on rent; and\n\tWhereas, according to a poll conducted by the Sienna College Research Institute on behalf of the Invest in Our New York (IONY) Campaign, 57% of State residents are unsatisfied with the State's ability to ensure everyone pays their fair share in taxes, and 67% of State residents are in favor of raising taxes on the wealthy; and \n      Whereas, S.1980/A.3690, sponsored by Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assemblymember Dr. Anna R. Kelles respectively, was introduced to the New York State Senate (\"Senate\") on January 18, 2023 and to the New York State Assembly (\"Assembly\") on February 3, 2023; and\n\tWhereas, S.2059/A.3115, sponsored by Senator Robert Jackson and Assemblymember Demond Meeks respectively, was introduced to the Senate on January 18, 2023 and to the Assembly on February 2, 2023, and was originally introduced as S.2622/A.4604 to the Senate on January 22, 2021 and to the Assembly on February 4, 2021; and\n\tWhereas, S.2782/A.3193, sponsored by Senator Jabari Brisport and Assemblymember Michaelle C.
