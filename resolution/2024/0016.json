  "Text": "Whereas, The Social Security Act Amendments of 1972 created Supplemental Security Income (SSI), a means-tested cash-assistance program for citizens and nationals of the United States (US) who are disabled or over the age of 65; and\n      Whereas, The Medicaid Personal Needs Allowance (PNA) is the amount of monthly SSI that residents whose long-term stays in hospitals or nursing homes are over fifty percent Medicaid-funded can receive for discretionary spending; and\n      Whereas, PNA can be spent on basic needs items including, but not limited to, personal hygiene products, clothing, shoes, and multivitamins as well as participation in recreational activities such as purchasing materials for hobbies, eating out, or transportation costs to visit family and friends; and\n      Whereas, The Social Security Act Amendments of 1972 limited the amount of SSI assistance for older adults in nursing homes or extended care facilities to $300 per year, or $25 per month, on the assumption that residents in nursing homes have all their other needs met; and\n      Whereas, The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 increased the PNA to $360 per year, or $30 per month, and allowed states to set a higher PNA at a maximum of $200 per month; and\n      Whereas, Under the Social Services Law of the State of New York, the State provides additional monthly assistance of between $35 and $90 depending on certain eligibility criteria such as status as a veteran or long-term residence in Title XIX (Medicaid Certified) nursing homes; and\n      Whereas, Neither the federal PNA nor the State of New York's supplementary assistance has been increased since it 1988; and\n      Whereas, According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, there has been about 155% inflation between 1988 and today; and\n      Whereas, The average nursing home resident's PNA is $50 per month, while in 1988, a PNA of $50 per month had the buying power of $132 today; and\n      Whereas, As of November 1, 2023, per the Human Resources Administration monthly reporting, there were over thirty-three thousand Medicaid enrollees in nursing homes in New York City; and\n      Whereas, Individuals receiving long term care in nursing facilities are often living in poverty conditions, and as an Associated Press news article from March 2023 highlighted, the minimal PNA is not sufficient for older individuals to purchase even the basic items they need to live comfortably, especially as the items that nursing homes provide may be low quality, sparse, or not appropriate for their individualized needs; and\n      Whereas, S.7786, sponsored by New York State Senator Mannion, and A.8396, sponsored by New York State Assemblymember Solages, would increase the monthly amount of PNA to between\n$128 and $140 based on eligibility criteria; and\n\n      Whereas, Increasing the PNA in line with inflation will give older adults living in nursing facilities the financial means necessary to participate more fully in society, engage in their hobbies and interests, and access necessities which will ensure their dignity and quality of life; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the New York State Legislature to pass and the Governor to sign, S.7786/A.8396 to increase personal needs allowance amounts for individuals who are deemed eligible.\n      \nLS #15288\n1/5/2024 \nPR",
