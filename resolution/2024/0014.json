  "Text": "Whereas, An internet connection is essential for a person's modern life and societal participation, powering civil service delivery, modern communication, educational attainment and services, job searches and applications, and more; and\n      Whereas, The Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) was established by Congress in 2021 as part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, with $14.2 billion appropriated for the program and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) tasked with developing and implementing the program; and\n      Whereas, The ACP is an internet affordability program which allows qualifying households to receive internet service discounts of up to $30 per month as well as a discount of up to $100 for a qualifying device; and \n      Whereas, According to the White House, as of January 2024 there are about 22.5 million households nationwide enrolled in and receiving benefits from the ACP, including more than 1,700,418 households across every Congressional District in New York State; and\n      Whereas, The FCC revealed that the ACP is almost out of funding and cannot continue running without additional funding from Congress, releasing an order on January 11, 2024 that contained details on the wind-down of the ACP, with steps that include not accepting new ACP enrollments after February 7, 2024, and an estimation that the program would cease to exist in April 2024 barring additional funding; and\n      Whereas, On January 10, 2024, U.S. Senators Peter Welch (D-Vt.), J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), and Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) and U.S. Representatives Yvette D. Clarke (NY-09) and Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-01) introduced S.3565/H.R.6929, also known as the Affordable Connectivity Program Extension Act of 2024, which would provide $7 billion for the ACP; and\n      Whereas, The legislation was referred to the U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations and the U.S. House Committee on Appropriations on January 10, 2024; and \n      Whereas, The Affordable Connectivity Program Extension Act of 2024, in providing $7 billion for the ACP, would allow millions of people across the U.S. and in NYC to continue taking advantage of more affordable internet service prices past the estimated sunset of April 2024; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the United States Congress to pass, and the President to sign, S.3565/H.R.6929, the Affordable Connectivity Program Extension Act of 2024. \nCCK\nLS # 15588\n2/2/2024\n2",
