  "Text": "Whereas, A lithium-ion battery is a rechargeable device that is commonly used in electronics and mobility devices, such as cellular phones, scooters and e-bikes; and\n    Whereas, A lithium-ion battery, when faulty or overheated, can cause fires that are extremely dangerous because they are self-sustaining and are difficult to contain and extinguish; and\n    Whereas, The construction of these batteries contain a pressurized electrolyte fluid that makes them dangerous in a range of circumstances, which may compromise the battery's integrity and cause the battery to explode or ignite; and\n    Whereas, These circumstances include but are not limited to: (i) impact damage to the battery; (ii) a manufacturing flaw; (iii) aging and deterioration of the battery components; (iv) extreme temperatures; and (v) overcharging; and\n    Whereas, Additionally, overcharging lithium-ion may produce an exothermic decomposition of the battery cell, which may lead to rupturing and thermal explosion and is incredibly challenging for firefighters to extinguish; and \n    Whereas, During 2022, there were 220 reported lithium-ion battery related fires in the City resulting in 146 injuries and 6 deaths; and   \n    Whereas, New York City continues to experience a growing number of e-bike fires, both residential and commercial, that not only destroy property but result in fatalities; and\n    Whereas, On April 10, 2023, two young people, a 7-year-old boy and his 19 year-old sister, were killed in a residential fire caused by an e-bike being charged near the front door of an apartment building in Astoria, Queens; and\n    Whereas, In 2023, the City Council passed local laws to curb these fires and better protect and educate the public on the dangers of lithium-ion batteries, including: (i) establishing an informational campaign to educate the public on fire risks posed by power mobility devices; (ii) prohibiting the sale, lease, or rental of powered mobility devices, such as e-bikes and electric scooters, and storage batteries for these devices, which fail to meet recognized safety standards; and (iii) prohibiting the assembly or reconditioning of a lithium-ion battery using cells removed from used storage batteries and the sale of a lithium-ion battery that uses cells removed from used storage batteries; and\n    Whereas, H.R. 1797, introduced by United States Representative Richie Torres, and S.1008 introduced by United States Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, which would require the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (\"CPSC\") to promulgate a consumer product safety standard with respect to rechargeable lithium-ion batteries used in micromobility devices, and for other purposes; and\n    Whereas, H.R. 1797/S. 1008, also known as the Setting Consumer Standards for Lithium-Ion Batteries Act, would require the CPSC to establish a final consumer product safety standard for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries used in personal mobility devices, such as electric scooters and e-bikes; and\n    Whereas, The Setting Consumer Standards for Lithium-Ion Batteries Act would help protect the public against the risk of fires caused by such batteries throughout the country; now, therefore, be it\n    Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on Congress to pass and the President to sign the Setting Consumer Standards for Lithium-Ion Batteries Act, which would promulgate consumer product safety standards with respect to rechargeable lithium-ion batteries used in micromobility devices.\n\nSession 13\nLS #13315\n01/18/2024\n\nSession 12\nWJH\nLS 13315\n7/6/23",
