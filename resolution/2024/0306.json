  "Text": "Whereas, The current municipal civil service promotional system must do more to ensure the recruitment and retention of a highly motivated and skilled workforce; and \n      Whereas, Under New York State law, New York City (City) must rank candidates for competitive class title positions, including promotions, based on their exam results and fill vacancies from the top three ranking candidates; and\n      Whereas, This system recognizes employees for their test-taking ability, which may or may not best represent the applicant's ability to perform the duties of the promotional position; and\n      Whereas, Moreover, this system does little to distinguish high-performing employees and promote career development; and\n      Whereas, To encourage employee advancement and build a pipeline of qualified managers within City agencies, the City must explore opportunities to optimize the civil service promotional exam system for applicants who acquire additional skills and training; and \n      Whereas, The Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) offers a wide range of courses, educational programs, and professional development opportunities to City employees that help build expertise and improve service delivery; and\n      Whereas, DCAS offers Executive Development and Management & Supervision training courses for public sector leaders; and\n      Whereas, These courses include instruction in core managerial competencies and tools to enhance creative thinking and decision-making; and\n      Whereas, DCAS's Executive Development Portfolio includes the flagship Management Academy and Leadership Institute, which are competitive programs for high-performing leaders that include courses such as Intentional Leadership, Promoting Psychological Safety to Improve Performance, and Organizational Design for Executives; and\n      Whereas, DCAS's Management & Supervision portfolio includes open enrollment courses such as Data Analytics for Hiring Managers, Essential Skills for Leaders, and Fundamentals of Supervision; and\n      Whereas, Employees who complete these trainings deserve recognition for taking the initiative to learn new professional skills to foster their leadership abilities and advance their careers; and \n      Whereas, DCAS is the Municipal Civil Service Commission for the City, tasked with administering the Civil Service Law and upholding the principles of merit and fitness within the City's workforce; and\n      Whereas, As the Municipal Civil Service Commission, DCAS has discretion to assess a candidate for promotion based on their seniority, trainings, experience, and performance ratings; and \n      Whereas, DCAS may prioritize an employee's skills and motivation to excel by rewarding participants who complete the agency's managerial and supervisory trainings with additional points on their civil service promotional exam; and\n      Whereas, Awarding points for the successful completion of training programs reinforces a culture of meritocracy, where advancement is based on skills, knowledge, and performance, thereby fostering greater job satisfaction and retention; and\n      Whereas, City-provided trainings provide equal opportunities for skill development and career advancement, leveling the playing field and enabling individuals from diverse backgrounds to access leadership positions; and\n      Whereas, Therefore, promoting individuals who have completed Executive Development and Management & Supervision trainings can lead to increased representation in promotional titles among women, people of color, and other minority groups; and \n      Whereas, Encouraging employees to participate in professional development training can cultivate a diverse and capable management cadre within the civil service, ensuring that the municipal workforce possesses the necessary tools and competencies to meet the evolving needs and challenges of City service; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the Department of Citywide Administrative Services to grant additional points on promotional exams to examinees who have completed the agency's Executive Development and Management & Supervision trainings. \n\nLS 15992\n3/25/24\nEA\n2",
