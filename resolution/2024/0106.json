  "Text": "Whereas, The New York City (\"NYC\" or \"City\") Rent Freeze Program, which includes the Disability Rent Increase Exemption (\"DRIE\") program, helps eligible individuals remain in affordable housing by freezing their rent at the current level and exempting them from future rent increases; and\n      Whereas, Under the NYC Rent Freeze Program, a property tax credit covers the difference between the actual rent amount and what a tenant is responsible for paying at the frozen rate; and\n      Whereas, To qualify for DRIE, one must be at least 18 years old; be named on the lease/rent order or have been granted succession rights in a rent controlled, rent stabilized, or rent regulated hotel apartment; have a combined household income of $50,000 or less; spend more than one-third of their monthly household income on rent; and have been awarded Federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Federal Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), United States Department of Veterans Affairs disability pension or compensation; or disability-related Medicaid if the applicant has received either SSI or SSDI in the past; and\n      Whereas, Individuals may also qualify for DRIE if they meet the aforementioned criteria and live in an apartment located in a building where the mortgage was federally insured under Section 213 of the National Housing Act, owned by a Mitchell-Lama development, Limited Dividend housing company, Redevelopment Company or Housing Development Fund Corporation incorporated under the New York State (\"State\") Private Housing Finance Law; and\n      Whereas, The restrictive eligibility requirements for DRIE exclude thousands of households in which a family member has a disability, but who is not considered an eligible head of household under current law; and\n      Whereas, S.3563, sponsored by State Senator Cordell Cleare, and A.2367, sponsored by State Assembly Member Harvey Epstein, would amend the language of the real property tax law to allow a parent, legal guardian, or other relative of a person with a disability to qualify a household for DRIE, and provide rent relief to households that face similar or identical hardships to those already covered by DRIE; now, therefore be it\n\tResolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.3563/A.2367, to expand eligibility for the Disability Rent Increase Exemption program to additional qualifying household members.\n\nSession 13\nCGR\nRes.
