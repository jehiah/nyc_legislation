  "Text": "Whereas, The New York State Education Department (NYSED) has described Social Emotional Learning (SEL) as \"the process through which children, youth, and adults acquire and effectively apply the knowledge, attitudes, and skills necessary to understand and mange emotions, set and achieve positive goals, feel and show empathy for others, establish and maintain positive relationships, and make responsible decisions\"; and \n      Whereas, The NYSED has pointed to studies showing that, compared to students who do not receive SEL instruction, students who do receive it have higher achievement scores; better attitudes, including motivation to learn; fewer disruptive classroom behaviors; and less emotional stress, including depression and anxiety; and\n      Whereas, The NYSED has stated that SEL instruction can also \"decrease implicit bias, increase cultural responsiveness, and result in greater equity\" among young New Yorkers; and\n      Whereas, The NYSED has established three SEL goals for students: \"Develop self-awareness and self-management skills essential to success in school and in life\"; \"Use social awareness and interpersonal skills to establish and maintain positive relationships\"; and \"Demonstrate ethical decision-making skills and responsible behaviors in personal, school, and community contexts\"; and \n      Whereas, The Center for Benefit-Cost Studies of Education at Teachers College, Columbia University, claimed in The Economic Value of Social and Emotional Learning in 2015 that, for every dollar spent on SEL programming with proven results, there is a return on investment of 11 dollars; and\n      Whereas, SEL Day on March 10, 2023, was celebrated and acknowledged by commitments to advocate for and engage in SEL activities from students and educators in all 50 United States (U.S.) states and in 88 countries; and\n      Whereas, U.S. President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. issued a statement on March 10, 2023, stating that \"children are the kite strings that keep our national ambitions aloft\" and that, through SEL, \"our students get the resources and support they need to learn, make good decisions, build community, and achieve their goals\"; and \n      Whereas, President Biden pledged that his Administration would \"continue to work with educators, schools, and organizations to ensure that the best practices of social and emotional learning are being promoted nationwide\"; and\n      Whereas, New York State (NYS) Governor Kathy Hochul issued a citation on March 10, 2023, recognizing SEL as a \"valued program within our state's schools and a beneficial resource in the lives of all New Yorkers\"; and\n      Whereas, Governor Hochul further noted that SEL is \"essential to our success in school, the workplace, at home, and in our communities-allowing us to participate in and contribute to society in meaningful ways\"; and\n      Whereas, NYS Assembly bill A.3087, introduced on February 2, 2023, by Assembly Member Vivian Cook, of Assembly District 32 in Queens, would require the NYS Commissioner of Education to establish a pilot program to improve the delivery of SEL instruction statewide, including in at least one school in each NYS school district, and to administer the pilot program under contract with an outside community-based organization with a proven track record in SEL instructional delivery for students in prekindergarten through twelfth grade, among other relevant qualifications; and\n      Whereas, March 8, 2024, has been designated as the fifth annual international SEL Day; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York designates the second Friday in March annually as Social and Emotional Learning Day in the City of New York and recognizes the importance of ensuring that prekindergarten through twelfth grade public school students acquire the social-emotional competencies needed to succeed in life. \n\n\nLS #15248\n1/11/2024\nRHP\n\n1",
