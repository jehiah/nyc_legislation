Eisenhower, at the urging of major U.S. veterans organizations; and\n      Whereas, According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2022 there were 16.2 million veterans in the U.S.; and\n      Whereas, A 2021 New York State Department of Health survey estimated that approximately 969,000 veterans live in the state, with more than 282,000 of those residing in New York City (NYC); and\n      Whereas, The NYC Department of Education (DOE) typically recognizes and closes schools for all U.S. federal holidays, including Veterans Day; and\n      Whereas, However, DOE's 2023-2024 School Year Calendar does not include a school closure date for Veterans Day, as November 11th falls on Saturday in 2023; and\n      Whereas, Generally, a fixed date federal holiday that falls on a Saturday or Sunday is usually observed on the closest weekday, so that a holiday falling on a Saturday is observed on the preceding Friday, while a holiday falling on a Sunday is observed on the succeeding Monday; and\n      Whereas, Some parents, teachers, and students have expressed disappointment and anger that NYC public schools will not commemorate the vital contributions of veterans this year by observing Veterans Day; and\n      Whereas, It is crucial for NYC schools to observe Veterans Day to honor the contributions of veterans and enable students to learn about and recognize the service and sacrifices of U.S. military veterans; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the New York City Department of Education to observe Veterans Day the Friday before November 11th if it falls on a Saturday and the Monday after the 11th if it falls on a Sunday.\n\nSession 13\nLS # 14454\n10/17/23 \nJA\n\nSession 12\nLS # 14454\n10/17/23",
