  "Text": "Whereas, Gun violence remains a critical public safety issue that requires focused and efficient intervention; and\n      Whereas, According to the John Hopkins School of Public Health, gun violence is the leading cause of premature death in the United States with 48,204 people killed in 2022, and \n      Whereas, In addition to the immeasurable human toll, this violence costs the nation approximately $557 billion annually and New York State approximately $11.4 billion per year, according to The Economic Cost of Gun Violence by Everytown Research & Policy; and\n      Whereas, According to the New York State Department of Health, in New York and nationally, gun violence disproportionately impacts Black and Hispanic communities, with Black individuals being 10 times more likely to be killed and 18 times more likely to be injured by a gun compared to their white counterparts; and\n      Whereas, In July 2021, New York State issued Executive Order 211, declaring a Disaster Emergency in response to the escalating gun-related incidents and hospitalizations, necessitating urgent action; and\n      Whereas, Executive Order 211 emphasized the importance of community engagement as a key component in addressing and combating gun violence effectively; and\n      Whereas, As part of the 2022 State of the State to prevent and reduce gun violence and violent crime in New York State, the Governor announced a three-part agenda focusing on three core initiatives: investing in state and local law enforcement gun safety efforts, partnering with localities and neighboring states to combat gun trafficking, and tripling investment in community-based gun violence response programs; and\n      Whereas, The Office of Gun Violence Prevention (\"OGVP\") was established as part of New York State's three-part agenda to coordinate efforts in combating gun violence; and\n      Whereas, OGVP is tasked with fostering collaboration among community partners, local municipalities, and state agencies to ensure a unified and effective approach to reducing gun violence; and\n      Whereas, OGVP is currently situated within the New York State Department of Health (\"NYSDOH\") where it executes the central role in consolidating fragmented violence prevention strategies across the state; and \n      Whereas, The evolving nature and complexities of gun violence, and its intersection with the criminal justice system, require adaptive and specialized responses; and \n      Whereas, The State of New York seeks to further enhance its efforts to reduce the prevalence of gun violence through a streamlined and coordinated approach; and\n      Whereas, Relocating OGVP to the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services would enable it to leverage the Division's extensive expertise in law enforcement and criminal justice; and \n      Whereas, This relocation would foster more integrated and impactful responses to gun violence, with a continued emphasis on community engagement to ensure better traction and transparency in addressing gun violence across the state; and\n      Whereas, S9904, sponsored by State Senator Zellnor Myrie would situate the Office of Gun Violence Prevention within the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services to oversee efforts aimed at reducing gun violence; and\n      Whereas, The Gun Violence Advisory Council, as established by this act, will assist OGVP in advising on policy, programs, and actions necessary to reduce gun violence; and\n      Whereas, The transfer of the Office of Gun Violence Prevention to the Division of Criminal Justice Services aims to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of gun violence prevention programs across the state; and\n      Whereas, The advisory council will play a crucial role in ensuring ongoing collaboration and the sharing of knowledge and best practices between governmental agencies and community organizations; and\n      Whereas, The Division of Criminal Justice Services has a strong focus on crime prevention and justice system coordination, which aligns with the core goals of OGVP; and\n      Whereas, This transition is expected to enhance the effectiveness of the OGVP's strategies and initiatives by integrating criminal justice resources with gun violence prevention efforts; now, therefore, be it \n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.9905, in relation to establishing the Office of Gun Violence Prevention and the Gun Violence Advisory Council.\nCMB\nLS#17755\n10/10/24",
