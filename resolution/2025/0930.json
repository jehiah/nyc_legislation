  "Text": "Whereas, Saint Gennaro, the Bishop of Benevento in Italy, died in the year 305 after being tortured and beheaded at the hands of those who enforced the persecution of Christians that was ordered by Roman Emperor Diocletian; and\n      Whereas, The story of Saint Gennaro says that a Neapolitan woman put some of the blood from his severed head into a vial for safekeeping and that this blood re-liquefies each September 19 on the anniversary of his brutal death; and\n      Whereas, Saint Gennaro's body is preserved in Naples, where he is the city's patron saint and where the Neapolitans pray to him in times of emergency, such as for protection from deadly natural disasters; and\n      Whereas, When Italian immigrants came to Manhattan's Lower East Side at the turn of the 20th century, many who came from Naples made their home on Mulberry Street; and\n      Whereas, In 1926 for the first time in America, Italian immigrants and Italian Americans in that neighborhood honored their Neapolitan traditions by holding a one-day block party in remembrance of their patron saint; and\n      Whereas, The Feast of San Gennaro has continued each year ever since, growing into an 11-day celebration covering 11 blocks of Manhattan's Little Italy neighborhood and attracting visitors from across New York City (NYC) and beyond; and\n      Whereas, The Feast of San Gennaro, which marks a time of joyful gathering in the crowded streets, amidst strings of lights and delicious foods sold in booths and neighborhood restaurants, also serves as a way to raise funds for schools and charities that benefit the children of the NYC Archdiocese; and\n      Whereas, In 2025, the Feast of San Gennaro will be held from September 11 through September 21; and\n      Whereas, Earlier in September each year on the Sunday after Labor Day, the Bronx's Little Italy, with the support of the Belmont Business Improvement District, hosts the Ferragosto Festival on Arthur Avenue near East 187th Street to celebrate Italian culture, offering live entertainment and the Italian food that Arthur Avenue is famous for among all New Yorkers; and\n      Whereas, The Ferragosto Festival was first brought to the Bronx over 25 years ago by local small business owners, many of whom still ran family businesses that started more than a century ago; and\n      Whereas, The history of Ferragosto dates back to the Roman Emperor Octavian Augustus in 18 BCE, when he established feriae Augusti (\"the holidays of Augustus\") to give agricultural workers a day off after months of harvesting; and\n      Whereas, Feriae Augusti was born from an earlier festival dedicated to Conso, the Roman god of earth and fertility, which had marked the end of agricultural work for the season; and\n      Whereas, Originally celebrated on the first day of the month named for Emperor Augustus, the holiday was eventually moved by the Catholic Church to August 15 to coincide with the day that honors the Assumption of Mary into heaven and was recognized as a Holy Day of Obligation by the Western Church as early as the 7th century; and \n      Whereas, Today in Italy, Ferragosto is celebrated as an August break when many shops close and many Italians head off to the beach or mountainside for recreation and relaxation; and\n      Whereas, In 2025, the Ferragosto Festival in the Bronx's Little Italy will be held on Sunday, September 7; and\n      Whereas, NYC is home to just over 500,000 individuals who identify as Italian, according to 2020 data compiled by NYC Planning's Population FactFinder; and\n      Whereas, Residents of Italian ancestry are the largest European ethnic group in NYC, and NYC has the third-largest population of residents of Italian ancestry among cities outside of Italy; and  \n      Whereas, Since NYC's earliest days, but especially since the 1880s, Italian immigrants and Italian Americans have contributed significantly to the landscape of NYC, including churches, language, the arts, sports, restaurants, bakeries, and more; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York celebrates the Feast of San Gennaro and the Ferragosto Festival annually in September to honor the contributions of Italian immigrants and Italian Americans to the cultural, political, and economic fabric of the City of New York.\n\n\nLS #19291 and #19292\n5/7/2025\nRHP\n\n      \n2",
