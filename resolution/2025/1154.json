  "Text": "Whereas, Family caregivers play an indispensable role in the health and social-care ecosystem by providing unpaid assistance - such as help with bathing, dressing, medication management, transportation, meal preparation, and household tasks - to relatives, friends, or neighbors living with chronic illness, disability, or age-related limitations; and\n      Whereas, As of 2025, there are approximately 63 million family caregivers in the United States, representing nearly one-in-four adults; and\n      Whereas, In New York State (NYS), there are an estimated 4.1 million caregivers providing unpaid care, of which an estimated 1.3 million reside in New York City (\"NYC\" or \"City\"); and\n      Whereas, According to AARP, the unpaid care provided by family caregivers in NYS is valued at about $39 billion annually, underscoring the considerable economic contribution and cost savings they generate by enabling loved ones to remain in their homes and communities; and\n      Whereas, This essential work often occurs with little formal training, limited respite, and significant strain on a caregivers own physical health, mental well-being, and employment stability; and\n      Whereas, Caregivers also face substantial financial and practical burdens, with AARP national data showing that 80% spend their own money to help meet a loved one's needs, averaging $7,200 or 25% of their income, and NYS data showing 36% of caregivers report financial setbacks such as new debt or depleted savings; 26% struggle to access affordable supports like meal delivery and transportation; and 28% simultaneously care for a child under the age of 18 while also providing adult care, often while holding full- or part-time jobs that they may be forced to reduce hours or leave entirely; and\n      Whereas, The population of older adults in NYC is growing rapidly: the number of New Yorkers age 65 and older increased by 53% from 2000 to 2023 and is now approximately 1.43 million, making older adults one of the fastest-growing demographic groups in the City; and\n      Whereas, As the City's older adult population expands, the need for family caregivers continues to grow, making the recognition, support, and education of caregivers a public priority; and\n      Whereas, While caregivers should be celebrated every day, Family Caregivers Month is a time to recognize and honor caregivers, raise awareness around caregiving issues, educate communities, and work to increase support for our City's caregivers; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York designates November as Family Caregivers Month in the City of New York.\n \n \nCGR\nLS #20634\n11/19/2025\n\n2",
