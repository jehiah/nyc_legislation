  "Text": "Whereas, In New York City (\"NYC\"), parking permits, otherwise known as \"parking placards,\" are routinely issued by City, State and Federal entities and allow for holders to park for free within the City and, at times, in areas not available to those without permits; and \n      Whereas, Annually, City agencies, particularly the NYC Department of Transportation, the NYC Police Department, and the NYC Department of Education, issue tens of thousands of parking permits, largely to City employees with the intended purpose that they be used only when conducting City business; and \n      Whereas, According to the NYC Department of Investigation (\"DOI\"), in 2022, more than 95,000 parking permits were issued; and \n      Whereas, The misuse of City-issued parking permits, which includes parking illegally while displaying a valid permit, the use of permit \"stand-ins\" such as business cards or work vests by those who may not have a valid permit, and the proliferation of fraudulent permits, has become a long-standing issue; and \n      Whereas, A 2024 DOI report found, among other things, that: the City lacks a uniform process for the creation and issuance of parking permits; and the City's enforcement of laws and policies regarding parking permit revocation and use is lax; and \n      Whereas, Based on 311 Service Request data, for Calendar Year 2024 there were approximately 19,091 \"Parking Permit Improper Use\" 311 Service Requests throughout the City, as compared to Calendar Year 2023 when there were 11,608 service requests of the same nature; and \n      Whereas, Parking permit abuse and misuse continues to be a concern in NYC; and \n      Whereas, A.471, sponsored by New York State (\"NYS\") Assembly Member Amy Paulin, and S.3873, sponsored by NYS Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal, would work to address this issue by establishing a parking placard review board to review the impact of parking placard use in NYC; and \n      Whereas, A.471/S.3873's parking placard review board would have City, State and Federal representation, and would review the impacts of parking placard use, while also issuing a report and making recommendations on how to address this issue; and  \n      Whereas, The report would include recommended criteria for the retention of existing parking placards and how to distribute new placards in the future, while examining how often placards are misused, how often complaints related to placards are received, the effectiveness of efforts that have been implemented on this issue, and the enforcement of penalties; and \n      Whereas The parking placard review board established by the bills would advance efforts to obtain an accurate picture of the true impacts of parking placard abuse, and address such impacts; now, therefore, be it \n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, A.471/S.3873, which establishes a parking placard review board to undertake a review of the impact of parking placard use within the city of New York. \nKK\nLS 19080\n3/4/25",
