  "Text": "Whereas, According to the Wall Street Journal, New York City property owners owed $1.65 billion more in property taxes in 2020 than the previous year; and \n      Whereas, According to a 2018 report by the New York City Comptroller, from 2005 to 2016, New York City households making less than $50,000 experienced a 98 percent increase in property taxes and a one percent decrease in median incomes, resulting in their property tax burden nearly doubling from nearly seven percent to almost 13 percent; and\n      Whereas, Persons with disabilities and persons ages 65 years and older (older adults) face economic and health challenges, including, but not limited to, living on fixed incomes, which complicate paying property taxes, resulting in having to choose between paying property taxes or paying for prescription drugs or other necessities; and\n      Whereas, According to a report by the New York State Comptroller, in 2017, 34 percent of  working-age people with disabilities in New York City lived in poverty, more than twice the percent of those without disabilities (14 percent); and\n      Whereas, According to a report by the New York City Comptroller, in 2015, approximately 39 percent of older adult homeowners paid more than 30 percent of their income on housing; and \n      Whereas, According to New York City Government Poverty Measure 2019, in 2019, approximately 22 percent of older adults in New York City lived in poverty, compared to 16 percent of persons ages 18 to 64 years; and\n      Whereas, Section 459-c of the State Real Property Tax Law provides persons with disabilities, who own one-, two- or three-family homes, condominiums or cooperative apartments with a combined annual income of $58,399 or less, a disability homeowner exemption (DHE), to reduce their property taxes; and\n      Whereas, Section 467 of the State Real Property Tax Law, provides older adults, who own one-, two- or three-family homes, condominiums or cooperative apartments with a combined annual income of $58,399 or less, a senior citizen homeowner exemption (SCHE), to reduce their property taxes; and\n      Whereas, DHE and SCHE enable persons with disabilities and older adults in New York City to reduce their property taxes by up to 50 percent; and \n      Whereas, While the New York City Department of Finance administers DHE and SCHE in New York City, State Real Property Tax Law authorizes them, defining many aspects of the exemptions, including a March 15 application deadline in New York City; and \n      Whereas, A fixed March 15 application deadline limits the number of persons with disabilities and older adults in New York City who may apply for and receive DHE and SCHE; and\n      Whereas, State legislation to institute a rolling application deadline in New York City for DHE and SCHE would enable more persons with disabilities and older adults to apply for and obtain the exemptions, reducing the property tax burdens of two populations who often encounter financial challenges in paying property taxes; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, legislation to institute a rolling application deadline in New York City for the disability homeowner exemption and the senior citizen homeowner exemption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNLB\nLS #9632\n8/5/22\n      1\n      \n      \n      1\n      \n      \n      3\n      \n      \n      3",
