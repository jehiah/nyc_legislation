  "Text": "Whereas, The 2025-2026 ice hockey season marks the centennial of the New York Rangers (NY Rangers), affectionately known as the \"Classiest Team in Hockey\"; and\n      Whereas, The NY Rangers were one of the \"Original Six\" teams in the National Hockey League (NHL) from 1942 to 1967, which settled into place after the constantly changing variety of teams that had made up the NHL in the 1920s and 1930s and before the addition of expansion teams in 1967; and\n      Whereas, Founded in 1926, the NY Rangers in their first 16 seasons made it to the Stanley Cup playoffs 15 times, to the Stanley Cup finals six times, and to the winner's circle three times; and\n      Whereas, The NY Rangers' most recent Stanley Cup victory came in the 1993-94 season after very competitive playoffs, including captain Mark Messier's famously promising that the NY Rangers would win game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the New Jersey Devils, when the NY Rangers were down 3-2 in the series and facing elimination, and then scoring a hat trick to lead his team to victory; and\n      Whereas, Canadian native Lester Patrick, known as \"The Silver Fox\" and a genius at playing the game, brought his own impressive Canadian hockey credentials to New York City (NYC) to become general manager and head coach of the NY Rangers in 1926 and led the team to the best record in the American Division in its first year, before winning the Stanley Cup the following year; and\n      Whereas, During his 20-year career with the NY Rangers, Patrick developed a farm system of affiliated teams and training to nurture young talent to keep the future success of the team guaranteed; and\n      Whereas, Former NY Ranger star center and playmaker Frank Boucher, who succeeded Patrick as head coach and general manager, noted simply that Patrick \"was the most knowledgeable hockey man I ever met\"; and\n      Whereas, The NY Rangers have had their share of All-Stars, trophy winners, Hall of Famers, high scorers, and defense standouts, many of whom have had their numbers retired, including Rod \"Mr. Ranger\" Gilbert, Brian Leetch, Henrik Lundqvist, Jean Ratelle, Mark Messier, Mike Richter, Andy Bathgate, Bill and Bun Cook, Brad Park, Harry Howell, Eddie Giacomin, Ron Greschner, Vic Hadfield, Wayne Gretzky, and so many more; and\n      Whereas, The NY Rangers were nicknamed \"the Blueshirts,\" thanks to their blue jerseys, with RANGERS written diagonally across the front, which they have worn a similar version of every year since their inaugural season, and now the team has brought out for this season a special centennial version akin to the original from 100 years ago; and \n      Whereas, The magic of the NY Rangers is wrapped up in the magic of playing in Madison Square Garden (The Garden), \"The World's Most Famous Arena,\" and the rapport the players have with their loyal fans, who pass down their love of the team from generation to generation, according to former NY Ranger Adam Graves, beloved by fans and known for his work both on the ice and in the community; and\n      Whereas, Nothing says New York like the NY Rangers and The Garden; now, therefore, be it\n\tResolved, That the Council of the City of New York honors the centennial of the New York Rangers franchise and its many contributions to New York City's culture and history. \n\n\nLS #20619\n12/2/25\nRHP\n\n1",
