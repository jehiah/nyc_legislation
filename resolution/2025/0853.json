and\\par\n\\tab Whereas, To improve the effectiveness of traffic and parking enforcement, and increase the likelihood the owner of a motor vehicle is held monetarily liable for violating relevant rules and laws, law enforcement should be able to list a vehicle\\rquote s VIN in the \\ldblquote Notice of Violation,\\rdblquote  rather than license plate number, when the license plate numbers of such vehicle is missing, concealed, obscured, or distorted such that law enforcement personnel cannot accurately read such plate number; now, therefore, be it \\par\n\\tab Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, legislation to amend the vehicle and traffic law to permit a motor vehicle\\rquote s Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) to be listed in a \\ldblquote Notice of Violation,\\rdblquote   instead of license plate number,  in circumstances when a license plate of such vehicle is missing, concealed, obscured, or distorted. \\par\n\\par\n\\pard\\cbpat1\\ltrpar\\qj\\fs20 LS 19448\\par\nJDK\\par\n4/14/25\\par\n\\pard\\ltrpar\\sa160\\sl252\\slmult1\\f1\\fs22\\par\n}\n",
