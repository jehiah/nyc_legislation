  "Text": "Whereas, Utilities, such as electricity and gas, are essential aspects of everyday life, providing people with, among other things, access to heating and cooling; and \n      Whereas, Despite utilities being used every day, utility prices for American households continue to increase; and \n      Whereas, According to Powerlines, a non-profit focused on lowering utility bills, utility rate increase requests and approvals in the United States (\"U.S.\") totaled more than $34 billion in the first three quarters of 2025, almost double the $16 billion in requests and approvals over the same period in 2024; and \n      Whereas, According to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, New York State (\"NYS\") has the sixth most expensive electricity prices for residential customers of any state in the U.S. mainland; and \n      Whereas, According to a 2025 NYC Comptroller report titled \"Record Highs: Tackling Energy Insecurity in the Heat of the Climate Crisis,\" New York City (\"NYC\") residents pay 54.4 percent above the national average for electricity; and \n      Whereas, The high costs of utilities in NYS and NYC only exacerbate the relatively high cost of living; and \n      Whereas, For example, in August of 2025, documents filed by utility companies with the NYS Public Service Commission (\"PSC\") stated that 1.2 million New Yorkers throughout the state were more than 60 days behind in their utility payments, owing $1.8 billion; and \n      Whereas, Also, according to AARP New York's legislative representative, an average of 1,839 households in NYS in August had their service cut off each day; and \n      Whereas, According to a 2024 report published by Robin Hood, a research-based organization focused on addressing poverty, entitled \"The Prevalence and Persistence of Energy Insecurity in New York City,\" in an average year, 20 percent of NYC residents fall behind on utility payments and 9 percent have their utilities shut off, and over a 5-year period, 42 percent fell behind on utility payments in at least 1 year, and 23 percent experienced utility shutoffs during that period; and\n      Whereas, Areas that have been affected by severe weather events, such as Staten Island, which has been hit by a number of superstorms, may experience increased utility costs; and \n      Whereas, The PSC recently approved National Grid to raise rates for its 2.4 million customers in upstate New York, and there is an awaited PSC decision for Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc.'s request to raise rates on its 9 million customers in NYC and Westchester County; and \n      Whereas, Although the PSC and the NYS Utility Intervention Unit do represent consumers in New York, neither is able to act solely on behalf of the interest of consumers; and\n      Whereas, Although more than 40 states and the District of Columbia have an independent state agency that represents the interests of residential utility customers, NYS is one of the few states that does not have such an office; and \n      Whereas, S.6277, which is sponsored by NYS Senator Jessica Scarcella-Spanton and has passed the NYS Senate, and companion bill A.2468, which is sponsored by NYS Assemblymember Jeffrey Dinowitz and has passed the NYS Assembly, would create the State Office of the Utility Consumer Advocate, which would serve as an independent advocate and appear on behalf of New York consumers in state and federal regulatory proceedings, as well as judicial review proceedings concerning rates and conditions of public service utilities; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the New York State Governor to sign S.6277/A.2468, which would create the State Office of the Utility Consumer Advocate to represent the interests of residential utility customers.\n\nKK\nLS 20766\n11/25/25",
