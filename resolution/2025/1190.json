  "Text": "Whereas, The origins of human hair donation began as long ago as 1795, with the birth of the wig industry, when wigs were then purchased mostly as a fashion choice by the wealthy; and\n      Whereas, In the 1950s, wigs made from human hair were found to be more comfortable and more natural looking for individuals suffering from hair loss after chemotherapy treatment for cancer, and human hair donations became a way to support those individuals dealing with the emotional side effects of cancer treatment; and\n      Whereas, Starting in the 1980s, hair donation organizations were founded to clarify the process of donating hair safely and efficiently and to work with wigmakers and nonprofit organizations, such as Locks of Love beginning in 1997, to ensure that wigs were accessible to those in need, including cancer survivors and individuals experiencing other forms of hair loss; and \n      Whereas, There are a variety of commemorative days and months designed to bring attention to the importance of hair donation to provide support for individuals experiencing hair loss from medical conditions, including National Hair Day on October 1, after which the nonprofit organization Wigs for Kids celebrates throughout the month of October to highlight the needs of children suffering from a variety of medical conditions that cause hair loss; and National Donate Your Hair Day on November 22, when hundreds of thousands of ponytails have been donated since 2006 through Pantene's Beautiful Lengths program, which works in cooperation with the American Cancer Society to produce free wigs for women fighting cancer; and\n      Whereas, September is Alopecia Areata Awareness Month, a time to recognize those individuals dealing with the effects of alopecia areata, an autoimmune disease that causes patchy or total hair loss, starting most often in childhood; and\n      Whereas, According to the National Alopecia Areata Foundation (NAAF), almost 7 million individuals of all ages, genders, and racial/ethnic groups in the United States have had, currently have, or will have alopecia areata; and\n      Whereas, NAAF's advocacy includes working to pass federal legislation to designate wigs as \"durable medical equipment\" so that insurance companies will cover the cost of wigs for those experiencing hair loss from alopecia areata; and\n      Whereas, It is fitting that National Hair Donation Month be officially commemorated across all five boroughs and that New Yorkers engage in activities that would lend a helping hand to their fellow New Yorkers suffering from medically related hair loss; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York declares September as Hair Donation Month in the City of New York.\n\n\nLS #20572\n12/4/2025\nRHP\n1",
