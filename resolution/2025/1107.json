  "Text": "Whereas, The Mitchell-Lama Housing Program, established in 1955, provides affordable housing to low- and middle-income families; and \t\n      Whereas, The New York State (\"NYS\" or \"State\") Division of Housing and Community Renewal (\"DHCR\") published the \"2024 Annual Report of Mitchell-Lama Housing Companies in New York State\" and reported that the New York City (\"NYC\" or \"City\") Department of Housing Preservation and Development (\"HPD\") oversees 92 developments with 44,392 units and NYS Homes and Community Renewal (\"HCR\") oversees 117 developments with 57,529 units; and \n\tWhereas, Despite the program's role in providing affordable housing to over 100,000 units statewide, a 2024 audit by State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli found unsafe conditions and over $1 million dollars in questionable spending at 3 complexes that had repair issues such as broken fire safety doors, mold, collapsed ceilings, and pest infestations; and\n      Whereas, These findings show similar problems identified in a 2023 State Comptroller audit of state supervised Mitchell-Lama developments that included Jamie Towers, where stairwell doors and garbage chutes would not close on their own, posing a fire risk to tenants, as well as cracked walkways and an out-of-service elevator; and\n      Whereas, The 2023 and 2024 State Comptroller audits reveal hazardous living conditions and financial mismanagement at several Mitchell-Lama Developments; and\n      Whereas, The 2024 audit cited lack of agency oversight as one of the contributing factors for financial mismanagement; and\n      Whereas, According to Community Service Society, Mitchell-Lama residents face unsustainable rent increases, including an attempted nearly 80 percent increase over 3 years (2023-2025) at Bedford Gardens in Brooklyn; and\n      Whereas, The 2024 State Comptroller audit found $3.7 million in rent and carrying charge arrears across the 3 developments it surveyed, indicating that current costs are already unaffordable for many residents; and\n      Whereas, Due to the systemic failures documented in the 2023 and 2024 State Comptroller audits that included unsafe living conditions, financial mismanagement, and lack of agency oversight, there is significant concern that the current procedures for resident complaints, official reviews, determinations, findings, and appeals are inadequate to protect Mitchell-Lama residents; and \n      Whereas, In response to these ongoing challenges, A.6432, sponsored by Assembly Member Latrice Walker, pending in the New York State Assembly, and companion bill S.4236, sponsored by State Senator Leroy Comrie, pending in the New York State Senate, would create an independent agency that would protect the rights of Mitchell-Lama residents; and\n      Whereas, A.6432/S.4236 would create an independent grievance and complaint system that would handle complaints such as harassment, unsupported rent increases, failure to provide essential services, and lack of transparency in cooperative board elections; and\n      Whereas, A.6432/S.4236 would require comptroller verification for all rent and carrying charge increases to ensure that they are financially necessary and supported by documented expenses; and\n      Whereas, A.6432/S.4236, would provide legal representation and pro se litigant support for Mitchell-Lama residents in landlord-tenant cases; and\n      Whereas, A.6432/S.4236 would require judges and court staff with specific knowledge and experience with Mitchell-Lama laws and regulations to oversee all related cases; and\n      Whereas, These reforms would help preserve the affordability and habitability of Mitchell-Lama developments for current and future low- and middle-income New Yorkers; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the New York Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, A.6432/S.4236, in relation to protecting the rights of Mitchell-Lama residents.\n\nJLC\nLS # 20144\n10/2/2025",
