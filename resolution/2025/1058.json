All Council [members] Members and Council employees shall be required to comply with the procurement procedures established by the Speaker, as well as any related requirements for training set by the Speaker.  The Speaker shall make available to all Council Members and Council employees a copy of such procedures and any changes thereto.\n      \n      [b.]b. The procurement procedures set by the Speaker shall take effect immediately. \n\n      [2.50]2.70.

Such policy shall require that all organizations that wish to be considered for discretionary funding from the expense budget or for discretionary funding from the capital budget for a \"non-City capital project\" shall file an application with the Council or relevant City offices and/or agencies.  For the purposes of this rule, a \"non-City capital project\" is a project for which the applicant organization is required to submit a Capital Funding Request Form for Not-for-Profit Organizations.  Applications for discretionary funding from the expense budget or for discretionary funding from the capital budget for a non-City capital project shall be reviewed by the Council and/or relevant City offices and/or agencies to ensure that they are legally eligible to receive the City funds, are capable of providing the services for which they seek funding, are seeking funding for a public purpose, and are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

Such disclosure/certification forms shall contain either disclosure of any relationship between an organization and applicable City officials and associated persons or firms so that a determination may be made as to whether funding such organization is consistent with the City's Conflicts of Interest Laws and if so whether disclosure is necessary, or a certification that no such relationships exist. \n\n      b. Allocation of discretionary funds from the expense budget or discretionary funds from the capital budget for a non-City capital project, designation of recipients of discretionary funds from the expense budget or discretionary funds from the capital budget for a non-City capital project, and delineation of the uses of such funds shall be made solely through the budget adoption or modification process or through a discretionary funding transparency resolution.  All such funds shall be distributed between and among sponsoring Council Members for allocation pursuant to a publicly disclosed formula that allocates funds either equally among [members]Council Members, or based upon publicly available data about differences between districts, or some combination thereof.  The Speaker shall be responsible for proposing no more than one half of all dollars allocated by the Council discretionary expense funding process.\n      \n      [2.60]2.90. Council Members' Operating Expenses - The amounts allocated in the Council budget for the operation of individual [members'] Council Members' offices shall be the same for each [member]Council Member.  The Speaker may not reduce such amount for any [member] Council Member unless all [members] Council Members are subject to the same reduction.  The Speaker may not supplement the amount available to any [member] Council Member through direct or indirect payment, provided that the Speaker may, with notice to all members, supplement the amount available to an individual [Councilmember] Council Member in cases of special need.  It is the intent of the body that the total amount allocated for the operation of individual [members'] Council Members' offices shall be reasonable in proportion to the amount allocated for central staff.\n      \n      [2.65]2.100. Prohibition against using funds from operating expenses for certain advertisements - a. No city funds appropriated to the Council (\"Council funds\") shall be used by a Council Member for the purchase of advertisements in an organization's journal or bulletin in print or other form; provided, however, that for purposes of this rule, a publication of an organization that is published at least quarterly and is distributed beyond the membership of the organization to the general public shall not be deemed a journal or bulletin.\n\n      b. No Council funds shall be used by a Council Member for the purchase of any advertisement published or broadcast in any print, radio or television or other electronic media that (i) does not solely consist of informational or educational content relating to a governmental function or a government-[ ]sponsored event or (ii) contains any seasonal or holiday greeting or message or any congratulatory or commemorative message or (iii) contains a Council Member's likeness, picture or voice.\n\n      c. The Council shall only approve the purchase of advertisements that comply with the provisions of this rule and such payment shall only be made after a copy of such advertisement (or a detailed description of any such advertisement if not in print form) is provided to the Speaker's designee together with the invoice for such purchase.\n\n      [2.70]2.110. Policies Prohibiting Discrimination and Harassment and Related Training - a.

The Speaker shall provide all Members, their staff and Council central staff with a copy of such policy or policies and any changes thereto.\n\n      b. The Speaker shall require mandatory annual participatory interactive training for all Members, their staff and Council central staff as outlined in the policy or policies established pursuant to [r]Rule [2.70a] 2.110(a).\n      \n      [2.75]2.120. Workplace Sexual Harassment Assessment and Reporting - a. The Speaker shall formulate a recurrent risk factor review plan to assess and address potential risk factors associated with workplace sexual harassment, such as a homogenous workforce, language differences in the workplace, a workforce having significant power disparities and isolated and decentralized workplaces. [The process herein shall commence immediately, recur periodically and cease January 31, 2022.]\n\n      b. The Speaker shall publish an annual report within the Council for the first Stated [meeting] Meeting in February disclosing complaints of workplace sexual harassment, as defined by the Council's policy or policies prohibiting discrimination and harassment established pursuant to [r]Rule [2.70a] 2.70(a).  Such report shall track for each preceding calendar year the number of complaints alleging workplace sexual harassment and the dispositions of such complaints.  The annual report shall not contain any personally identifiable information.\n \n      c. The Speaker shall distribute a discrimination and harassment climate survey.  Such survey shall gauge whether Council staff are familiar with the Council's policy or policies prohibiting discrimination and harassment, consider their workplace safe and free from violations of the Council's policy or policies and believe that the Council protects the rights of its employees to pursue their duties in a respectful workplace.  The climate survey shall assess whether Council staff have witnessed or experienced workplace discrimination or harassment as described by the Council's policy or policies and whether they understand Council reporting and complaint procedures.  The climate survey shall also gauge whether Council staff believe discrimination or harassment is, or would be, tolerated by the Council.  For supervisors and managerial employees, the climate survey shall prompt whether such supervisors and managerial employees are knowledgeable about their responsibilities with respect to the prevention of conduct prohibited by the Council's policy or policies prohibiting discrimination and harassment.  The climate survey shall also prompt whether such supervisors and managerial employees are knowledgeable about the measures they may take to address complaints. Information concerning demographic variables, including, but not limited to, race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation and age, shall be solicited from survey respondents.  Survey respondents may provide such demographic information, in full or in part, at their discretion.\n      \n      By the close of the first year of the term, the Speaker shall disseminate the climate survey.  By the close of the second year of the term, the Speaker shall assess the climate survey results, and, in response, determine and implement a preemptive action plan to create a discrimination-free and harassment-free workplace, as set forth in the Council's policy or policies established pursuant to [r]Rule [2.70a] 2.70(a).  By the close of the third year of the term, the Speaker shall refine and redistribute the climate survey.  By the [end]  close of the fourth and last year of the term, the Speaker shall assess the recent climate survey results, and, in response, recommend a successive preemptive action plan.  By the [end] close of the first year of [the ensuing] each succeeding term, [and every four years thereafter,]the Speaker shall address the preceding Speaker's recommendations[, disseminate a climate survey, assess the climate survey results, and, in response, determine and recommend a preemptive action plan for the next Speaker] and also reinitiate the climate survey process described in this paragraph.  Based on each assessment and determination, the Speaker shall update the Council's policy or policies prohibiting discrimination and harassment, as necessary, established pursuant to [r]Rule [2.70a] 2.70(a). \n\n      In the event a Speaker's term is fewer than four years, the subsequent Speaker shall [maintain]continue the [four-year climate survey schedule]process delineated [herein] in the preceding paragraph for the remainder of the unexpired term.  In [the event of] years when there are [two] consecutive [2]two-year terms, as provided by Section 25 of the Charter, the Speaker [of] serving the first two-year term shall initiate and [conclude]complete the steps delineated [herein for the first two years of a regular four-year term]for the first and second years of the term described in the preceding paragraph.  The Speaker [of] serving the second term shall initiate and [conclude] complete the steps delineated [herein for the final two years of a regular four-year term] for the third and fourth years of the term described in the preceding paragraph.\n\n      [2.80]2.130. Qualification of Council Members - Council Members, as public officers, must meet the qualifications of Section 3 of the New York State Public Officers Law in order to hold public office.  In addition, Section 30 of such law sets forth provisions governing the creation of vacancies in public office.  The Committee on Rules, Privileges and Elections shall have jurisdiction over these matters.  The Committee, or staff of the Committee acting under its direction, shall request such information as is reasonably necessary to review the qualifications of Council Members-elect.  In addition, the Committee may determine whether particularized review of qualifications of a Council Member-elect or eligibility to serve of a Council Member is appropriate based upon information submitted or otherwise available to the Committee, or based upon failure to submit information requested in accordance with the preceding sentence.  In the event that such a particularized review is conducted, the Council Member-elect, or Council Member, shall be afforded the right to be heard.  If the Committee believes that a Council Member-elect should not be seated, or that a Council Member is not eligible to serve in public office, due to failure to meet the qualifications of the Public Officers Law or due to the creation of a vacancy pursuant to such law, the Committee will recommend appropriate action to the full Council.  The record of the proceedings before the Committee on the matter shall be made available to the members of the Council before any such action is taken by the full Council.\n      \n\t[2.85]2.140. Outside Earned Income - Council Members may not receive outside earned income.  Outside earned income means income other than the Council salary and benefits of a [member] Council Member, except that such term does not include (1) investment income, including but not limited to interest, dividends, rents, annuities and capital gains; (2) compensation for personal services actually rendered before the adoption of this rule or before such individual became a [member] Council Member; (3) income received from a pension or retirement account, or from social security; (4) copyright royalties received under usual and customary contractual terms; (5) compensation for speaking engagements or artistic performance, with advance approval by the conflicts of interest board; (6) income received for teaching a course of instruction at an established academic institution for which students receive credit, or income in the form a fellowship or scholarship granted by such an institution, so long as such compensation does not exceed that normally received by others at the institution for a comparable type and amount of instruction; and (7) with advance approval by the [Office of ]General Counsel, minimal earned income from activity involving only a limited time commitment, and which does not interfere with the performance of official duties.  Any income received by a [member] Council Member shall be subject to the requirements of [chapter] Chapter 68 of the [charter] Charter. [Until January 1, 2018, the provisions of this rule do not apply to any member who submits a letter to the Speaker no later than March 1, 2016 stating that such member has received outside income during the Council's 2014-2017 session and intends to continue to receive outside earned income.\n      \n\t2.90]2.150. Collective Bargaining - All collective bargaining matters including recognition, negotiation, administration and enforcement of collective bargaining agreements and/or other agreements the Council may reach with unions or employee organizations representing [c]Council employees shall be within the jurisdiction of the Speaker.\n\n\t2.160. Declared States of Emergency - Whenever there exists a state of emergency declared by the Governor or the Mayor pursuant to New York Executive Law, the Speaker shall have the power to establish policies and procedures to protect the health and safety of Council Members and all Council staff.  Such policies shall have the force of Council Rules for the duration of such state of emergency.\n\nCHAPTER - III PRESIDING OFFICER\n\n      3.00. Who Presides - a.
