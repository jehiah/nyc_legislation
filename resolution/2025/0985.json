Rosenthal introduced S.2534/A.7851, which will freeze the rent a SCRIE or DRIE enrollee pays based on the rent they were paying on the day they first became eligible for the program, or, if they enter the program more than two years after their initial eligibility, the rent they were paying two years before they entered the program; and\n\tWhereas, This bill will serve to protect vulnerable New Yorkers by shielding them from rent hikes that occur after they become eligible for the program, ensuring that they are not penalized for not knowing about the program or not applying quickly enough; and\n\tWhereas, S. 2434 has already passed the New York State Senate; now, therefore, be it\n\tResolved, that the Council of the City of New York calls on the New York State Assembly to pass, A.7851, and the Governor to sign, S.2534/A.7851, which retroactively freezes the rent at which a SCRIE or DRIE enrollee pays at the level it was when they first became eligible, or at the level it was two years before they entered the program, given that entrance into the program occurred more than two years after they first became eligible.\nJN\nLS 15188, 15307, & 19771\n7/1/2025",
