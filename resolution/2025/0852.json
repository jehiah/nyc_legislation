  "Text": "Whereas, Individuals rely on the Social Security Administration (\"SSA\") for critical life events, including the birth of a child, Medicare enrollment, and accessing benefits such as retirement, disability, the low-income subsidy (\"Extra Help\"), and Supplemental Security Income (\"SSI\"); and\n      Whereas, According to the SSA's 2025 fact sheet (\"the fact sheet\"), in 2025, an average of nearly 69 million Americans receive Social Security benefits each month, totaling approximately $1.6 trillion in payments throughout the year; and\n      Whereas, According to the SSA, Social Security is a major source of income for older Americans, with nearly nine out of ten individuals aged 65 and older receiving benefits as of December 31, 2024; and\n      Whereas, The fact sheet indicates Social Security benefits account for approximately 31% of the total income of people over age 65, with 39% of men and 44% of women relying on Social Security for at least half of their income, and 12% of men and 15% of women depending on it for 90% or more of their income; and\n      Whereas, Furthermore, according to the fact sheet, life expectancy for a 65-year-old has increased from nearly 14 years in 1940 to over 20 years today, and the number of Americans aged 65 and older is projected to rise from approximately 61 million in 2023 to 77 million by 2035; and\n      Whereas, President Trump, in collaboration with the Department of Government Efficiency (\"DOGE\"), has directed the General Services Administration (\"GSA\") to terminate leases on approximately 7,500 federal offices, including those of the Social Security Administration; and\n      Whereas, The SSA announced in a press release on February 28 that it is undergoing staffing reductions, and in alignment with recent executive orders from the White House, the SSA has set a staffing target of 50,000 employees, down from the current level of approximately 57,000; and\n      Whereas, The SSA is already experiencing severe staffing shortages, with former SSA Commissioner O'Malley testifying before Congress on March 21, 2024, that by the end of fiscal year 2024, the agency would serve 7 million more beneficiaries with 7,000 fewer full-time staff than in fiscal year 2015; and\n      Whereas, Commissioner O'Malley warned that the SSA cannot keep doing more with less, highlighting that budget constraints have resulted in the lowest staffing level in 25 years; and\n      Whereas, The combination of staffing shortages and office closures could further exacerbate delays and restrict access to critical services for SSA beneficiaries; and\n      Whereas, According to the House of Representatives Democrats Appropriations Committee fact sheet, the Republican continuing resolution passed on March 14, 2025, which runs through September 30, allows DOGE and President Trump to fire thousands of employees at the Social Security Administration, which would result in the closure of Social Security offices, increased wait times for the 1-800 number, and unacceptable backlogs for Social Security beneficiaries trying to access their earned benefits; and\n      Whereas, Despite President Trump's assurances that Social Security won't be touched by DOGE and the SSA's commitment to prioritize customer service, these recent actions threaten beneficiary access to essential services; and\n      Whereas, The combined impact of these actions could result in individuals losing access to Medicare coverage, Social Security benefits, and other critical services they rely on; and\n      Whereas, Federal officials can take numerous steps to protect social security such as, preventing the closure of Social Security Administration offices, ensuring adequate staffing levels at the SSA, increasing funding, and opposing any efforts to privatize Social Security; and\n      Whereas, Proposed legislation should include measures to secure long-term funding for the Social Security program, such as adjusting revenue streams or exploring alternative funding sources, to ensure that the SSA can continue providing benefits without disruption to the millions of Americans who rely on it; and\n      Whereas, It is imperative that Congress prioritizes the protection of vulnerable groups, including low-income seniors and individuals with disabilities who rely heavily on Social Security benefits to meet basic living expenses, and pass legislation that ensures the stability and sufficiency of Social Security payments, prevents benefit cuts, and strengthens support for those who depend on these benefits for their well-being and survival; now, therefore, be it \n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the United States Congress and the President to take steps to protect social security.\n      \nCMB\nLS#19186\n3/24/25",
