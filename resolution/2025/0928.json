  "Text": "Whereas, According to a 2024 survey by Tork, a global hygiene and health company, 44 percent of the people they surveyed felt anxious about using public bathrooms, primarily due to privacy concerns; and\n      Whereas, The Journal of Planning Literature, a peer-reviewed academic journal, reported that poor public bathroom design could lead to urinary tract infections and other health issues since people may avoid using these facilities; and\n      Whereas, According to New York City (\"NYC\" or the \"City\") Tourism and Conventions, the City welcomed nearly 65 million visitors in 2024, while the NYC Department of City Planning reported the city's population to be approximately 8.5 million, all of whom require access to safe and accessible public bathrooms; and\n      Whereas, According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, traditional gender public bathrooms create a challenge for families, as parents have to either accompany their children of a different gender into a public bathroom or permit their children to use bathrooms unattended, creating potentially uncomfortable situations; and\n      Whereas, The Williams Institute at UCLA found that transgender individuals living according to their gender identity are more likely to be denied bathroom access or verbally harassed when using bathrooms that match their birth-assigned sex; and\n      Whereas, All-gender bathrooms, which can be used by any person regardless of gender, would help accommodate seniors or disabled New Yorkers who may require assistance from caregivers of a different gender; and\n      Whereas, Establishing clear design standards for all-gender bathrooms would improve a user's comfort and privacy; and\n      Whereas, A.6964A, sponsored by Assembly Member Harvey Epstein and pending in the New York State Assembly, and companion bill S.7131A, sponsored by State Senator Rachel May and pending in the New York State Senate, would establish standards for the design and construction of all-gender bathrooms; and\n      Whereas, A.6964A/S.7131A would create consistent privacy and security standards for all-gender bathrooms, such as lockable individual toilet stalls with a minimum door height of 84 inches and a maximum undercut of 4 inches; and\n      Whereas, A.6964A/S.7131A would require shared sink areas positioned outside of individual toilet stalls while also allowing for separate sinks within each stall; and\n      Whereas, A.6964A/S.7131A would permit all-gender bathrooms in both new construction and existing structures undergoing repair, renovation or alteration works; and\n      Whereas, A.6964A/S.7131A would require the establishment of standards for clear signage and wayfinding to identify all-gender bathrooms; and\n      Whereas, A.6964A/S.7131A would permit all-gender bathrooms in both new construction and existing structures undergoing repairs, renovations, or alterations; and\n      Whereas, A.6964A/S.7131A would help create an environment where every New Yorker or person visiting New York State can access public bathrooms without anxiety or fear of judgement, and would help accommodate diverse needs; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, A.6964A/S.7131A, in relation to establishing standards for the design and construction of all-gender bathrooms.\n\nJLC\nLS # 19495\n5/21/2025",
