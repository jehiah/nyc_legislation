Commencing upon the Effective Date and during each year thereafter until June 30, 2046, the Owner shall make real property tax payments in the sum of the Gross Rent Tax. Commencing upon July 1, 2046, and during each year thereafter until the Expiration Date, the Owner shall make real property payments in the sum of the Contract Rent Differential Tax. \n\n5. Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary:\na. The New Exemption shall terminate if HPD determines at any time that (i) the Exemption Area is not being operated in accordance with the requirements of Article XI of the Private Housing Finance Law, (ii) the Exemption Area is not being operated in accordance with the requirements of the Regulatory Agreement, (iii) the Exemption Area is not being operated in accordance with the requirements of any other agreement with, or for the benefit of, the City of New York, (iv) any interest in the Exemption Area is conveyed or transferred to a new owner without the prior written approval of HPD, or (v) the construction or demolition of any private or multiple dwelling on the Exemption Area has commenced without the prior written consent of HPD.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prohibit the granting of any real property tax abatement pursuant to Sections 467-b or 467-c of the Real Property Tax Law to real property occupied by senior citizens or persons with disabilities.\n\nOffice of the City Clerk,     }\nThe City of New York        } ss.:\nI hereby certify that the foregoing is a true copy of a Resolution passed by The Council of the City of New York on October 9, 2025, on file in this office.\n\n_______________________\nCity Clerk, Clerk of Council\n\n\n2",
