  "Text": "Whereas, Asthma affects over 1.4 million adults in New York (NY or NYS) alone, according to the NYS Department of Health (DOH); and\n      Whereas, According to the United States (U.S.) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an estimated 315,000 or 8.9% of children in NY are living with asthma; and\n      Whereas, The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reported in 2022 that nationally, more than 20 million adults and over 4.5 million children live with asthma, while asthma-related health issues result in more than 1.7 million emergency department visits each year and over $50 billion in healthcare costs, as estimated by the CDC; and\n      Whereas, Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are leading causes of respiratory illness and death, with asthma killing approximately 10 people daily and COPD accounting for around 390 deaths each day, making COPD the sixth-leading cause of death in the U.S.; and\n      Whereas, Despite the severity of asthma and the high cost burden on the healthcare system, asthma inhalers-essential, life-saving devices-remain prohibitively expensive for many, with prices reaching up to $640 per month, further straining patients and families who need these medications to manage their condition; and\n      Whereas, To address this issue, NYS Assembly Member Jessica Gonz�lez-Rojas and State Senator Gustavo Rivera have introduced legislation, S.1804/A.128, aimed at eliminating deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, or any other cost-sharing requirements for asthma inhalers in NYS; and\n      Whereas, This issue is particularly pressing in areas like Astoria in Queens County, represented by Gonz�lez-Rojas, where high rates of asthma hospitalizations have led to the area being labeled \"asthma alley,\" with a disproportionate impact on young people of color; and\n      Whereas, State Senator Rivera's district in the northwest Bronx includes numerous census tracts designated as disadvantaged communities by the Climate Justice Working Group; and\n      Whereas, According to the DOH's 2023 report on Asthma Burden in NYC, the Bronx exhibited the highest asthma mortality rate among New York City boroughs, as well as the highest pediatric emergency department visit rates for asthma-related issues; and\n      Whereas, States including Minnesota, Washington, and New Jersey have already passed legislation that caps the costs of asthma inhalers, setting precedents for addressing the financial barriers to accessing essential healthcare for asthma sufferers; and\n      Whereas, The passage of S.1804/A.128 would provide critical relief to New Yorkers with asthma, ensuring that cost is not a barrier to accessing necessary asthma medication and ultimately supporting better health outcomes for vulnerable communities across New York; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.1804/A.128, legislation that would eliminate deductibles, copayment, coinsurance, or any other cost-sharing requirements for asthma inhalers.\n\n\nLS #17723\n3/19/2025\nJN",
