  "Text": "Whereas, The labor movement in the United States (U.S) is the organized effort by workers collectively to improve their working conditions, wages, benefits, and safety, often through the formation of labor unions and political action; and\n\tWhereas, Labor unions have a long history in New York City (NYC), including the founding of the United Federation of Teachers (UFT), which represents nearly 200,000 members and is the sole bargaining agent for most of the non-supervisory educators who work in the NYC public schools;\n\tWhereas, Labor movement events such as the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire are important to teach NYC public school children because it helps students understand workplace conditions that have led to significant reforms in labor laws and safety regulations; and\n\tWhereas, The Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire was a devastating 1911 blaze in NYC, which tragically killed 146 garment workers, mostly young immigrant women, due to unsafe working conditions, locked exits, and inadequate fire safety measures, and sparked a national movement for workplace safety reforms; and \n\tWhereas, New York State (NYS) Senate Bill S.1254, introduced on January 11, 2023, by NYS Senator Rachel May, representing NYS Senate District 48 in Manhattan, and pending in the State Senate, would require the NYS commissioner of education to implement an expanded curriculum on the history of the labor movement in the U.S; and\n\tWhereas, In Sonali Kolhatkar's article, \"Labor Education Starts in School,\" published in The New York Times on September 3, 2007, claims that high school students are routinely trained in job readiness and career preparation and such training is intended to ensure children shape themselves to meet the needs of existing jobs, but not how young people can protect themselves from exploitation; and \n\tWhereas, Kolhatkar states such education is essential at a time when increasing numbers of minors are entering the workforce and vulnerable children make ideal low-wage workers from a corporate perspective and are often the victims of labor violations; and\n\tWhereas, In Florida State Senate bill SB.918, introduced on March 4, 2025, by Senator Jay Collins, representing District 14 in Tampa, and pending in the State Senate, builds on the Florida HB 49 and would allow 16-and-17-year-olds to work more than eight hours on school nights and over 30 hours a week while school is in session, without mandated breaks; and \n\tWhereas, Florida State House bill 49, introduced in March 2024, by Governor Ron DeSantis, eased restrictions on the number of hours minors can work and allowed for waivers of the 30- hour-per-week limit when school is in session; and \n\tWhereas, A 2001 study by Hart Research found that 54 percent of student respondents in high school said that they knew little to nothing about unions and some had some knowledge about unions, and of those who had some knowledge, 37 percent of them gained it from personal experience, 26 percent from people in unions, and 25 percent from the media; and\n      Whereas, It is fitting that May be recognized as Labor History Month throughout NYC public schools to educate students about the significant role the labor movement has played in shaping society; and now, therefore, be it\n\tResolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the New York City Department of Education to establish May annually as Labor History Month in New York City public schools.\n\n\nLS #19260\n3/25/25\nOO\n\t \n\t \n1",
