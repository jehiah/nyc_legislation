  "Text": "Whereas, Under current New York State (NYS) law, individuals who fall behind on child support payments can face suspension of their driver's licenses, professional licenses, and recreational licenses as a punitive measure; and\n      Whereas, While intended to compel compliance with child support orders, the suspension of licenses often creates substantial barriers to employment and income stability, undermining a parent's ability to fulfill their financial obligations; and\n      Whereas, Driving privileges are essential for many New Yorkers, particularly those in areas with limited public transportation or whose employment requires driving; and\n      Whereas, Professional and occupational licenses, such as those required for barbers, nurses, or electricians, are necessary for individuals to maintain employment and earn income to support themselves and their families; and\n      Whereas, the punitive suspension of these licenses for nonpayment of child support is counterproductive, as it deprives individuals of the very tools they need to earn income and fulfill their child support obligations; and\n      Whereas, Data from the New York City Department of Social Services (DSS) as of February 2023 show that Black and Hispanic noncustodial parents are disproportionately impacted by driver's license suspensions, with 35 percent of cases involving Black noncustodial parents and 32 percent involving Hispanic noncustodial parents, which is higher than the rates for White noncustodial parents at 29 percent, Asian or Pacific Islander noncustodial parents at 25 percent, or individuals of mixed race or other backgrounds at 25 percent; and\n      Whereas, NYS Senate Bill S7746, sponsored by Luis Sep�lveda, and NYS Assembly Bill A7005, sponsored by Assembly Member Chantel Jackson, would amend existing state law to remove the suspension of licenses as a penalty for failure to pay child support, while preserving other legal enforcement mechanisms; and\n      Whereas, These bills eliminate outdated punitive practices that disproportionately impact low-income and marginalized communities; and\n      Whereas, By eliminating license suspensions for child support nonpayment, S7746 and A7005 promote economic stability, parental responsibility, and fairer outcomes for families and children; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, that the Council of the City of New York calls on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign S7746/A7005, which would prevent the suspension of driver's licenses, professional licenses, or recreational licenses as a punishment for failure to pay child support.\nEA\nLS19920\n7/23/25",
