  "Text": "Whereas, According to the United States Department of Transportation National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), speeding accounts for nearly one-third of all fatalities on roads, and puts all road users at risk; and \n      Whereas, According to the NHTSA, speeding can lead to: greater potential for loss of vehicle control; reduced effectiveness of occupant protection equipment; increased stopping distance after the driver perceives a danger; increased degree of crash severity leading to more severe injuries; economic implications; and increased fuel consumption/cost; and \n      Whereas, In 2023, according to Vision Zero View, there were 265 traffic fatalities and 52,949 traffic injuries in New York City (NYC); and \n      Whereas, NYC, like other jurisdictions, implements speed reducing measures throughout the City, of which include speed cameras, raised speed reducers, traffic diverters, and raised crossings, however, speeding is still an issue in many traffic fatalities and injuries; and \n      Whereas, As technology has advanced, intelligent speed assistance or intelligent speed adaptation (ISA) devices or systems have become more popular and more widely used; and \n      Whereas, ISA involves in-vehicle technologies that use Global Positioning System (GPS) data and accurate, digitally mapped, speed limit data to, among other things: provide information about speed limit and changes; provide visual or audible alerts when the speed limit is exceeded; provide accelerator resistance to make speeding more difficult; and/or automatically prevent speeding above the speed limit, according to the NHTSA; and \n      Whereas, ISA is a modern approach to reducing vehicle speeding, as it can, if needed, automatically prevent speeding above the speed limit, according to the NHTSA; and \n      Whereas, An European Transport Safety Council report noted that the use of ISA technology in the U.K. showed a 37% reduction in fatal accidents, and, when implemented in 50 NYC Department of Citywide Administrative Services' vehicles as part of a pilot program, ISA technology accounted for a 99% compliance rate with speed limits and a 36% reduction in hard braking events, which is often an indicator of unsafe driving; and \n      Whereas, In an effort to implement ISA technology within dangerous drivers' vehicles, S.7621 and A.7979 were introduced in the New York State (NYS) Legislature; and \n      Whereas, S.7621, introduced by NYS Senator Andrew Gounardes, and A.7979, introduced by NYS Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, would require the installation of ISA devices if a driver accumulates eleven or more points on their driving record during an eighteen month period, or receives 6 speed camera or red light camera tickets during a twelve month period; and \n      Whereas, This state legislation would improve street safety and reduce traffic fatalities and injuries in NYC and NYS by implementing life-saving technology into reckless drivers' vehicles; now, therefore, be it \n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the New York State Legislature to pass, and the New York State Governor to sign, S.7621/A.7979, requiring the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices for repeated violation of maximum speed limits. \nKK\nLS 16933\n6/20/24",
