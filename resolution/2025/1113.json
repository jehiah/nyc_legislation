For the purposes hereof, the following terms shall have the following meanings:\n\na. \"Effective Date\" shall mean the later of (i) the date of conveyance of the Exemption Area to the HDFC, or (ii) the date that HPD and the Owner enter into the Regulatory Agreement. \n\nb. \"Exemption\" shall mean the exemption from real property taxation provided hereunder.\n\nc. \"Exemption Area\" shall mean the real property located in the Borough of Queens, City and State of New York, identified as Block 2090, Lot 26, Block 3084, Lot 20, Block 3085, Lot 8, Block 3087, Lot 7, Block 3097, Lot 38, Block 3164, Lot 54, Block 9245, Lot 300, Block 9621, Lot 1, and Block 9631, Lot 227 on the Tax Map of the City of New York.\n\nd. \"Expiration Date\" shall mean the earlier to occur of (i) a date which is forty (40) years from the Effective Date, (ii) the date of the expiration or termination of the Regulatory Agreement, or (iii) the date upon which the Exemption Area ceases to be owned by either a housing development fund company or an entity wholly controlled by a housing development fund company.\n\ne. \"Gross Rent\" shall mean the gross potential rents from all residential, commercial, and community facility units on the Exemption Area without regard to whether such units are occupied or vacant, including, but not limited to, Section 8, rent supplements, rental assistance, or any other subsidy. \n\nf. \"Gross Rent Deadline\" shall mean three hundred and sixty-five (365) days from the date of the HPD letter requesting the information that HPD needs to calculate the Gross Rent Tax for the applicable tax year. \n\ng. \"Gross Rent Tax\" shall mean, with respect to any tax year, an amount equal to five percent (5.0%) of the Gross Rent in such tax year; provided, however, that if the Owner fails to provide the Gross Rent on or before the Gross Rent Deadline, Gross Rent Tax shall mean an amount equal to real property taxes that would otherwise be due in such tax year in the absence of any form of exemption from or abatement of real property taxation.  \n\nh. \"HDFC\" shall mean State Preservation Housing Development Fund Corporation or a housing development fund company that acquires the Exemption Area with the prior written consent of HPD.\n\ni. \"HPD\" shall mean the Department of Housing Preservation and Development of the City of New York.\n\nj. \"Owner\" shall mean, collectively, the HDFC and the Partnership.\n\nk. \"Partnership\" shall mean State Preservation LP or any other entity that acquires the beneficial interest in the Exemption Area with the prior written consent of HPD.\n\nl. \"Regulatory Agreement\" shall mean the regulatory agreement between HPD and the Owner establishing certain controls upon the operation of the Exemption Area during the term of the Exemption. \n\n2. All of the value of the property in the Exemption Area, including both the land and any improvements (excluding those portions, if any, devoted to business, commercial, or community facility use), shall be exempt from real property taxation, other than assessments for local improvements, for a period commencing upon the Effective Date and terminating upon the Expiration Date.\n\n\n3. Commencing upon the Effective Date, and during each year thereafter until the Expiration Date, the Owner shall make real property tax payments in the sum of the Gross Rent Tax.

If the noncompliance specified in such notice is not cured within the time period specified therein, the Exemption shall prospectively terminate.\n\nb.\tThe Exemption shall apply to all land in the Exemption Area, but shall only apply to buildings on the Exemption Area that exist on the Effective Date.\n\nc.\tNothing herein shall entitle the HDFC, the Owner, or any other person or entity to a refund of any real property taxes which accrued and were paid with respect to the Exemption Area prior to the Effective Date.\n\n5. In consideration of the Exemption, the owner of the Exemption Area shall, for so long as the Exemption shall remain in effect, waive the benefits of any additional or concurrent exemption from or abatement of real property taxation which may be authorized under any existing or future local, state, or federal law, rule, or regulation.
