Commencing upon the Effective Date, and during each year thereafter until the Expiration Date, the Owner shall make real property tax payments in the sum of the Gross Rent Tax.

In consideration of the Exemption, the owner of the Exemption Area shall, for so long as the Exemption shall remain in effect, waive the benefits of any additional or concurrent exemption from or abatement of real property taxation which may be authorized under any existing or future local, state, or federal law, rule, or regulation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) nothing herein shall prohibit the granting of any real property tax abatement pursuant to Sections 467-b or 467-c of the Real Property Tax Law to real property occupied by senior citizens or persons with disabilities, and (b) the J-51 Benefits shall remain in effect, but (i) the  Exemption shall be reduced by the amount of such J-51 Benefits, and (ii) the Gross Rent Tax shall not be reduced by such J-51 Benefits.\n\nOffice of the City Clerk,     }\nThe City of New York        } ss.:\nI hereby certify that the foregoing is a true copy of a Resolution passed by The Council of the City of New York on May 28, 2025, on file in this office.\n\n_______________________\nCity Clerk, Clerk of Council\n\n\n2",
