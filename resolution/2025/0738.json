  "Text": "Whereas, New York State (\"NYS\" or \"State\") Arts and Cultural Affairs Law Article 57-B establishes the Amistad Commission (\"Commission\") under the NYS Department of State (DOS) to review the State's education regarding the African slave trade and its implications on American history; and\n      Whereas, The Commission is named in honor of the group of enslaved Africans led by Joseph Cinque, who, while being transported on a Spanish slave shape named the Amistad, gained their freedom after overthrowing the crew in 1839 and eventually having their case successfully argued before the United States (U.S.) Supreme Court; and \n      Whereas, The Commission consists of 19 members, including the Secretary of State or their designee, the NYS Commissioner of Education or their designee, and the Chancellor of the State University of New York or their designee, and 16 public members, who are NYS residents chosen with regard to broad geographic representation and ethnic diversity, who have an interest in the history of the African slave trade and slavery in America, and the contributions of African Americans to society; and\n      Whereas, The NYS Education Department (NYSED) provides technical assistance and data to the Commission as may be necessary to carry out responsibilities pursuant to State law; and\n      Whereas, The Commission's duties and responsibilities include surveying and cataloging the extent and breadth of education concerning the African salve trade, slavery in America, the vestiges of slavery in the U.S., and the contributions of African Americans to society presently being incorporated into the curricula and textbooks across the State, as well as inventorying African slave trade, American slavery, or relevant African American history memorials, exhibits, and resources that should be incorporated into courses of study across NYS; and\n      Whereas, The Commission is also responsible for compiling a roster of individual volunteers who are willing to share their knowledge and experience in classrooms, seminars, and workshops with students and teachers on the subject of the African slave trade, American slavery and the impact of slavery on society today, and the contributions of African Americans to the U.S.; and\n      Whereas, Lastly, the Commission is responsible for preparing reports for the governor and the State legislature regarding its findings and recommendations on facilitating the inclusion of the African slave trade, American slavery studies, African American history, and special programs in the educational system of the State; and\n      Whereas, As NYSED oversees educational services, including curriculum, in the State, including New York City, it is better equipped to run the Commission; and\n      Whereas, S.1032, sponsored by NYS Senator Robert Jackson, would amend the Arts and Cultural Affairs Law to move the Commission from the Department of State to NYSED; now, therefore, be it\n\tResolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.1032 and a companion bill, to move the Amistad commission from the Department of State to the New York State Education Department.\n\nLS #16944\n06/24/2024\nCGR\n2",
