and\\par\n\\tab Whereas, According to the Mayo Clinic, hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a common condition that affects the body\\rquote s arteries, and it occurs when the force of the blood pushing against the artery walls is consistently too high and the heart has to work harder to pump blood; and\\par\n\\tab Whereas, Untreated hypertension can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and other serious health problems, according to the Mayo Clinic, who also suggest that starting at age 18, everyone should get their blood pressure checked at least once every two years, with some individuals requiring more frequent checks; and\\par\n\\tab Whereas, Hypertension complicates 5 percent to 10 percent of all pregnancies and is a leading cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality globally, according to an article published by the American Heart Association, making monitoring blood pressure especially important for pregnant individuals; and\\par\n\\tab Whereas, Hypertension during pregnancy may reduce blood flow to the placenta, resulting in less oxygen and fewer nutrients to the fetus, may cause the placenta to detach from the uterine wall too early, may cause premature delivery, and may result in injury to the pregnant individual\\rquote s other organs and future cardiovascular disease; and\\par\n\\tab Whereas, Postpartum individuals also face an increased threat from hypertension, especially individuals with pre-existing hypertension or preeclampsia, and their blood pressure should be monitored carefully, according to an article published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal; and\\par\n\\tab Whereas, According to the same article, about 5.7 percent of cases of preeclampsia or eclampsia may present \\i de novo\\i0 , meaning onset occurs, in the postpartum period, even without hypertension in pregnancy, increasing the importance of blood pressure monitoring for those who are postpartum; and\\par\n\\tab Whereas, To address these threats to maternal health, State Senator Lea Webb and State Assembly Member Chantel Jackson introduced in the State Senate and State Assembly, respectively, S.8541 and A.8946; and\\par\n\\tab Whereas, This legislation would mandate that Medicaid provide, free of charge, validated automatic blood pressure cuffs and monitors to all pregnant individuals without the need for a prescription, where validated means the blood pressure cuff and monitor is approved for use by pregnant and postpartum individuals; and\\par\n\\tab Whereas, The legislation also mandates that healthcare providers who provide services relating to the SMBP strategy be fully reimbursed by Medicaid for providing those services; and\\par\n\\tab Whereas, Furthermore, NYS should ensure this legislation includes individuals who are one-year postpartum, individuals who suffered a miscarriage or still birth within the previous year, and is enforced regardless of a patient\\rquote s immigration status and regardless of federal funding; and\\par\n\\tab Whereas, This legislation, if passed, would be a crucial step for improving the health outcomes of pregnant individuals, and their children, especially in New York City where maternal mortality is widely regarded as a public health crisis; now, therefore, be it\\par\n\\tab Resolved, that the Council of the City of New York calls on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.8541/A.8946, legislation that mandates that Medicaid automatically authorize the coverage of validated blood pressure cuffs and monitors for pregnant people and fully reimburse healthcare providers who assist such patients in their usage.\\par\n\\pard\\ltrpar\\qj\\fs20\\par\nJN\\par\nLS 19472\\par\n10/24/2025\\par\n}\n",
