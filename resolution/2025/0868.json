  "Text": "By The Speaker (Council Member Adams) and Council Members Far�as, Lee, Louis and Banks\n\tWhereas, While Medicaid is a federal program, each state develops and amends its own Medicaid plan pursuant to Section 1902 of the Social Security Act, before then seeking approval for the plan from the federal Department of Health and Human Services; and\n\tWhereas, Under New York State's (NYS) current plan, according to the American Medical Association (AMA), Medicaid will fully reimburse an individual for their purchase of an automatic blood pressure monitor, as long as they have a prescription and the blood pressure monitor is under $50.50; and\n\tWhereas, According to the AMA, doctors and other healthcare professionals do not receive reimbursement under Medicaid in NYS for providing services to an individual monitoring their blood pressure under the self-measured blood pressure (SMBP) strategy, an evidence-based strategy defined as the regular measurement of blood pressure by the patient outside the clinical setting, either at home or elsewhere, that can improve blood pressure control for individuals with hypertension; and\n\tWhereas, According to the Mayo Clinic, hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a common condition that affects the body's arteries, and it occurs when the force of the blood pushing against the artery walls is consistently too high and the heart has to work harder to pump blood; and\n\tWhereas, Untreated hypertension can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and other serious health problems, according to the Mayo Clinic, who also suggest that starting at age 18, everyone should get their blood pressure checked at least once every two years, with some individuals requiring more frequent checks; and\n\tWhereas, Hypertension complicates 5 percent to 10 percent of all pregnancies and is a leading cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality globally, according to an article published by the American Heart Association, making monitoring blood pressure especially important for pregnant individuals; and\n\tWhereas, Hypertension during pregnancy may reduce blood flow to the placenta, resulting in less oxygen and fewer nutrients to the fetus, may cause the placenta to detach from the uterine wall too early, may cause premature delivery, and may result in injury to the pregnant individual's other organs and future cardiovascular disease; and\n\tWhereas, Postpartum individuals also face an increased threat from hypertension, especially individuals with pre-existing hypertension or preeclampsia, and their blood pressure should be monitored carefully, according to an article published in the Canadian Medical Associating Journal; and\n\tWhereas, According to the same article, about 5.7 percent of cases of preeclampsia or eclampsia may present de novo, meaning onset occurs, in the postpartum period, even without hypertension in pregnancy, increasing the importance of blood pressure monitoring for those who are postpartum; and\n\tWhereas, To address these threats to maternal health, NYS should mandate that Medicaid provide, free of charge, validated automatic blood pressure cuffs and monitors to all pregnant and postpartum individuals without the need for a prescription, where validated means the blood pressure cuff and monitor is approved for use by pregnant and postpartum individuals; and\n\tWhereas, NYS should also mandate that healthcare providers who provide services relating to the SMBP strategy be fully reimbursed by Medicaid for providing those services; and\n\tWhereas, Automatic blood pressure cuffs and monitors should be provided for any pregnant or postpartum person on Medicaid, regardless of immigration status and regardless of federal funding; and\n\tWhereas, Such legislation or mandate would be a crucial step for improving the health outcomes of pregnant and postpartum individuals, and their children, especially in New York City where maternal mortality is widely regarded as a public health crisis; now, therefore, be it\n\tResolved, that the Council of the City of New York calls on the New York State Legislature to introduce and pass, and the Governor to sign, legislation that will mandate that Medicaid automatically authorize the coverage of validated blood pressure cuffs and monitors for pregnant and postpartum people and fully reimburse healthcare providers who assist such patients in their usage.\n\nJN\nLS 19472\n5/23/2025",
