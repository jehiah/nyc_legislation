  "Text": "Council Members Guti�rrez, Menin, Louis, Riley, Williams and Cab�n\n\n\tWhereas, According to a 2021 New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) report on Pregnancy-Associated Mortality in New York City (NYC), in 2016 through 2020, when compared to white non-Hispanic women and birthing people, Black non-Hispanic women and birthing people were found to be four times more likely to die of a pregnancy-associated cause, described as a pre-existing condition worsened by the pregnancy, and six times more likely to die of a pregnancy-related cause, when a death is directly attributable to complications from the pregnancy itself; and\n\tWhereas, The report found racism to be the driving factor in these disparities, citing \"historical and intentional under-investments\" in neighborhoods where Black non-Hispanic birthing people live, which when coupled with interpersonal racism, have resulted in lethal outcomes for birthing individuals in the Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC) community; and \n\tWhereas, The DOHMH found the attitude of \"anti-Blackness\" encountered by pregnant BIPOC individuals seeking medical attention to be driven by the pervasive, unjust, and systemic inequities that have become entrenched within the healthcare system; and\n\tWhereas, According to the 2023 New York State Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Advisory Council Report, the United States has the highest maternal mortality rate among developed nations; and\n      Whereas, Among the key findings in the 2024 New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) Report on Pregnancy-Associated Deaths in 2018-2020, it was reported that 73.6 percent of pregnancy-related deaths in New York State had at least some chance of being prevented; and\n      Whereas, Led by Ms. Shawnee Benton Gibson, the advocacy organization Speak! Move! Change! has co-produced and co-hosted the National Postpartum Awareness Week (PAW) Campaign for Black Maternal Health in conjunction with advocacy groups and other stakeholders; and\n      Whereas, PAW represents a collective membership comprised of women-led organizations such as The Advancement of Reproductive Innovation Through Artistry and Healing Foundation (ARIAH), Dr. Shalon's Maternal Action Project (MAP), and the Tatia Oden French Foundation, which have committed to raising awareness and amplifying the needs and voices of BIPOC people during their pregnancy, birthing, and postpartum journey; and\n\tWhereas, In 2023, PAW Partners led conversations, conducted research, and hosted events to educate individuals and communities to focus attention and resources on mitigating adverse birthing outcomes during the postpartum period or 4th trimester, when, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, BIPOC women and birthing people are most at risk for birth-related complications and outcomes; and \n\tWhereas, According to the DOHMH, in 2020 there were 29 maternal deaths related to pregnancy and childbirth in New York City (NYC) and among the individuals who died, 12 were Black, 9 were Latina, 4 were Asian, and 4 were white; and \n      Whereas, According to the 2024 NYSDOH Report on Pregnancy-Associated Deaths in 2018-2020, Black women and pregnant persons are now 9 times more likely to die from pregnancy or childbirth in NYC; and\n      Whereas, Working in conjunction with state advocacy groups, the National Governors Association conceived of and created Black Maternal Health Week to promote awareness to skyrocketing rates of maternal mortality and bring educational programming and activities to affected communities; and\n      Whereas, Through the power of PAW's collective, 25 states from across the country have joined the annual campaign to combat institutional racism, disseminate information on accessing positive resources, and provide awareness on how best to navigate the very real dangers faced by BIPOC women and birthing people as they interact with the medical community during the stages of pregnancy, birthing and postpartum care; now, therefore, be it \n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York recognizes National Postpartum Awareness Week for Black, Indigenous, People of Color in the City of New York, to occur annually, one week before Mother's Day.\n\n\nCD\nLS 17585\n11/25//24\n \n3",
