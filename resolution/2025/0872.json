  "Text": "Whereas, In the United States criminal court system, there is a competency standard that must be met for a defendant to stand trial; and\n      Whereas, If at any point during a legal proceeding, the competence of the defendant is questioned, the court is then obligated to determine whether the defendant is competent to proceed; and\n      Whereas, This determination can involve reviewing the defendant's criminal or medical records, a professional examination, or testimony in court, among a number of other steps; and\n      Whereas, Once the evidence is presented and evaluated, the court determines whether an individual is incapacitated as a result of a mental disease and incompetent to stand trial (IST); and\n      Whereas, If a defendant charged with a misdemeanor is determined to be IST, under New York's criminal procedure law the court must issue a final order of observation (FO/OBS); and\n      Whereas, Under the provisions of the Mental Hygiene Law (MHL), a defendant issued an FO/OBS is committed to the custody of a state civil psychiatric center and their misdemeanor charges are dismissed; and\n      Whereas, Once in a facility, the individual can remain there up to 90 days, with an evaluation taking place within 72 hours of admission; and\n      Whereas, However, these facilities have faced criticism regarding issues like \n\novercrowding, inadequate care, and potential for abuse, leading to calls for reform; and \n      \n      Whereas, Without proper procedures, patients are often discharged into communities without the beneficial connections to mental health or housing services, and according to a study from the Journal of Correctional Health Care, recidivism is high for individuals with severe mental illness; and\n      Whereas, A.2440, introduced by Assembly Member Tony Simone and pending in the New York State Assembly, and companion bill S.1744, introduced by Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal and pending in the New York State Senate, seek to amend the criminal procedure law, in relation to cases terminated due to mental disease or defect; and\n      Whereas, A.2440/S.1744 mandate that upon the court's issuance of an FO/OBS for non-felony defendants, the court must order the appropriate institution housing a defendant to assign a critical time intervention (CTI) care management team to the defendant; and\n      Whereas, This transitional service helps individuals with severe mental illness connect to long-term service providers, facilitates community integration, and helps foster independence; and\n      Whereas, A.2440/S.1744 also stipulates that prior to discharge, a defendant's assigned institution must make a single point of access (SPOA) referral to an SPOA agency near the defendant's last known county of residence; and\n      Whereas, Single point of access programs also seek to connect individuals with severe mental illness to services and treatment options that can support them and help their clients find benefits; and\n      Whereas, This legislation would ensure that justice involved individuals with severe mental illnesses are connected to adequate services that ultimately benefit themselves, their families, and their communities; and\n      Whereas, Investing in post-dismissal care for those with severe mental illness ensures that they receive critical resources after being discharged and prevents them from slipping through the cracks; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, A.2440/S.1744, also known as the SUPPORT Act, which imposes certain requirements on institutions housing a defendant due to mental disease or defect prior to the discharge of such defendant.\n\n\nLS #18177, 19327\n04/01/2025\nRLB",
