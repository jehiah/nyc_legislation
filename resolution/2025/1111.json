If the noncompliance specified in such notice is not cured within the time period specified therein, the Exemption shall prospectively terminate. \n\nb. The Exemption shall apply to all land in the Exemption Area but shall only apply to the buildings on the Exemption Area that exist on the Effective Date.\n\nc. Nothing herein shall entitle the Company, the Owner or any other person or entity to a refund of any real property taxes which accrued and were paid with respect to the Exemption Area prior to the Effective Date.\n\nd.
