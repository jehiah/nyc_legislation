  "Text": "Whereas, Over many years, multiple studies have indicated a considerable hospital-based racial and ethnic segregation of Medicaid patients, both nationally and within New York City (NYC), according to BMC Health Services Research; and\n      Whereas, This segregation is attributed to several factors, including proximity and location of hospitals, patient preference, insurance coverage, and patient steering through medical referrals; and\n      Whereas, Patient steering is a practice where healthcare providers direct or influence patients to seek care from specific providers or facilities based on the patient's insurance coverage or ability to pay, which contributes to disparities in healthcare outcomes and limits patients' ability to make informed choices about their healthcare providers; and\n      Whereas, In 2008, on behalf of Bronx Health REACH, New York Lawyers for the Public Interest (NYLIP) filed a complaint with the New York State Office of the Attorney General to address patient steering by 3 prestigious NYC private hospitals, New York-Presbyterian, Mount Sinai, and Montefiore; and\n      Whereas, In their complaint, NYLIP accused these hospitals of referring Medicaid patients to residents and fellow clinics staffed by trainees while patients with private insurance were referred to experienced, board-certified, attending physicians; and\n      Whereas, According to The American Medical Association (AMA) Journal of Ethics, patient steering is common among many academic health centers nationally and in NYC; and\n      Whereas, A series of articles published in the New York Times in 2022 exposed NYU Langone's practice of prioritizing affluent V.I.P. patients over other emergency room patients, revealing potential discrimination against vulnerable patients who are uninsured or on Medicaid; and\n      Whereas, Reportedly, NYU Langone would often perform cursory check-ups and send their poor and homeless patients to the neighboring safety net hospital, Bellevue; and  \n      Whereas, The AMA Journal of Ethics asserts that segregation based on insurance is often a \"de facto proxy for segregation by race,\" as the majority of Medicaid recipients tend to be from Black and Brown communities who are systematically disadvantaged; and \n      Whereas, In New York State, about 80% of the 4 million nonelderly Medicaid recipients identify as Black, Hispanic, Asian American, or another non-white race or ethnicity; and  \n      Whereas, In NYC alone, about 4,437,456 New Yorkers are enrolled in Medicaid, the majority of whom are people of color; and  \n      Whereas, The majority of NYC Medicaid recipients receive care at already over-burdened and under-resourced, non-affiliated Community Hospitals, which often results in lower quality of care and health outcomes; and \n      Whereas, A 2023 study examining hospitals' patient distribution based on race and ethnicity in the NYC Metropolitan area found that hospitals with larger non-white patient populations tended to be safety net hospitals with higher proportions of Medicaid recipients while neighboring private hospitals with similar bed sizes and services tended to have mainly white patients with private insurance; and  \n      Whereas, For example, NYU Langone Medical Center and Bellevue Hospital have similar bed size, number of inpatient and outpatients visits, and are a few blocks apart, yet they saw vastly different levels of Black patients in 2016-Bellevue (26%) and NYU Langone (9%)-according to the New School, Center for NYC Affairs; and \n      Whereas, Similar trends suggesting patient steering are associated with Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK), NYC's premier cancer hospital, where the number of Black patients with Medicaid was 2%, as well as the Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS), as only 49 or 0.3% of the HHS's 14,000 patients were Black with Medicaid, per a 2020 report by New School, Center for NYC Affairs; and \n      Whereas, Many studies have pointed to Medicare recipients experiencing greater barriers to scheduling appointments as compared to privately insured individuals, since public medical centers are usually over capacity while private medical centers hesitate to receive Medicaid recipients due to its lower reimbursement rates; and \n      Whereas, This obstructs vulnerable New Yorkers access to timely outpatient care and increases the risk of poor health outcomes, exacerbating inequalities in our healthcare system; and \n      Whereas, Integration of outpatient care involves the coordination and collaboration of healthcare providers across different settings, ensuring seamless transitions and continuity of care for patients; and\n      Whereas, To improve healthcare outcomes and ensure equitable health access for minority and indigent populations, it is crucial to address patient steering and promote the integration of outpatient care in both public and private hospitals; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the New York State legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, legislation prohibiting patient steering and mandating outpatient care integration in New York State.\n\n\nLS #12803\n8/18/23\nM.B",
