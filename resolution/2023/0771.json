Hyndman have introduced S1890/A2661, known as the Sickle Cell Treatment Act, and S1839A/A2609; and \n      Whereas, S1839A/A2609 aims to establish a sickle cell disease detection and education program within the NYS Department of Health to provide information and resources to individuals with SCD, their families, health care providers, and the general public; and\n      Whereas, The Sickle Cell Treatment Act, if passed, would establish 5 sickle cells centers of excellence and 10 outpatient treatment centers, staffed by specialists dedicated to serving SCD patients; and\n      Whereas, Together, these two bills would help increase awareness, knowledge, and understanding of SCD and its complications while improving access to quality prevention, care, and treatment, thereby reducing health disparities, complications, and mortality associated with SCD; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S1839A/A2609 and S1890/A2661, the Sickle Cell Treatment Act.\n\n\nLS # 14158 & 3455\n09/08/2023\nMB",
