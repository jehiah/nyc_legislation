Ruppersberger, seeks to amend the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 by providing for the reissuance of stolen benefits and would help states track SNAP skimming data to determine the spread of the crime and develop mechanisms to enhance security technology; and\n      Whereas, Victims of skimming need to have their stolen benefits restored so they and their families will not go hungry or suffer from food insecurity; now, therefore, be it \n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the United States Congress to pass and the President to sign, H.R.9319, known as the SNAP Theft Protection Act of 2022.\n\n\nCMB\nLSR#11840\n12/22/22",
