  "Text": "By Council Members Hanif, Cab�n, Richardson Jordan, Oss�, Restler, Avil�s, Won, Schulman, Louis, Guti�rrez, Bottcher and Riley\n\n      Whereas, In August 2022, Pakistan declared a national emergency after experiencing floods that caused death and destruction and cataclysmic damage affecting the residents, buildings, and critical infrastructure of Pakistan; and\n      Whereas, Reports indicate some areas of Pakistan had 450 percent more rain than a normal monsoon season and over one third of the country was submerged in water; and\n      Whereas, Over 33 million people have been affected by the flooding and 1,739 were killed; and\n      Whereas, Over 8 thousand miles of roads were destroyed; and\n      Whereas, Flood basins and drain systems were overwhelmed and areas were inundated with stagnant and contaminated flood water; and\n      Whereas, Villages, farms, and settlements were destroyed, and over one million livestock were killed; and\n      Whereas, Contaminated water and the destruction of crops and livestock threatens resident's health and food security, and Pakistan is trying to prevent a full scale hunger crisis; and\n      Whereas, Requests for financial aid remain seriously underfunded, hampering humanitarian support for residents and regions affected by the flooding; and\n      Whereas, According to data from The Center for Migration Studies, Pakistan is one of the top countries of origin for undocumented residents in the State of New York, largely in the City of New York; and\n      Whereas, Reports indicate more than 8,000 Pakistani students are studying in the United States, with a significant number of them in the City and State of New York; and\n      Whereas, Regulatory requirements from the Department of Homeland Security limit opportunities for international students to work, forcing them to rely on financial support from their home countries; and\n      Whereas, The devastation in Pakistan has made it unsuitable for Pakistanis to return, and Pakistani students and residents need stability in the United States to support themselves, their families, and recovery efforts in Pakistan; and\n      Whereas, Granting TPS and SSR would provide desperately needed protections and stability for Pakistanis in the United States; and\n      Whereas, The Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security is empowered to designate that a country qualifies for TPS and SSR when nationals who are already in the United States cannot return safely to their home countries due to extraordinary conditions, such as environmental disasters; and\n      Whereas, Advocates, like Desis Rising Up & Moving, engaged with Pakistani communities and students support TPS and SSR designation in response to the flood damage; and\n      Whereas, Designations of TPS and SSR for Pakistan would allow access to work permits, access to healthcare, lowered tuition fees, protection from deportation, the ability to request permission to travel back home, and many other local and state benefits; and\n      Whereas, The people of the City of New York possess a tremendous humanitarian spirit and have always expressed their solidarity with individuals from other nations who undergo suffering; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the President of the United States and the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to grant Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Special Student Relief (SSR) to those impacted by catastrophic flooding in Pakistan who are now living in the United States.\n\n\nLS #12368\n4/25/2023\nRLB",
