  "Text": "Whereas, An emergency alert system is essential for conducting speedy and complete investigations into missing victims of domestic violence and sexual assault; and\n      Whereas, The New York State Missing Persons Clearinghouse within the New York State Division of Criminal Justice administers three alert programs; and \n      Whereas, Alerts are issued at the request of law enforcement when certain criteria are met; and\n      Whereas, Alerts are designed to ensure the most rapid and widespread dissemination of information about missing children under the age of 21, missing college students of any age, and missing vulnerable adults who are cognitively impaired; and\n      Whereas, Within minutes of an alert activation, information about the person is distributed to police agencies, the media, New York State Thruway Authority signs and plazas, New York State Department of Transportation highway signs, airports, bus terminals, train stations, hospitals, social media, and other locations; and \n      Whereas, Details are displayed on highway signs for up to eight hours and alerts can remain active for up to 72 hours; and\n      Whereas, New York State's AMBER Alert system, which distributes pertinent information to locate missing children, has proven extraordinarily effective in reuniting children with their families; and\n      Whereas, According to New York States' AMBER Alert statistics, in nearly 7 of every 10 AMBER Alert cases, children are successfully reunited with their parents and in just over 17 percent of cases, the recovery is a direct result of the AMBER Alert; and \n      Whereas, The development of a statewide Purple Alert system, for those who have elected to participate, to disseminate much needed emergency notifications, about missing victims of domestic violence and coordinate the efforts of law enforcement, would support the safe rescue and return of victims in life threatening situations; and \n      Whereas, In most missing persons cases, the first 48 hours are the most critical to successfully reunite victims with their loved ones; and\n      Whereas, A Purple Alert system would galvanize communities to assist in the search and safe recovery of vulnerable victims of domestic violence; and \n      Whereas, The \"Purple Alert\" bill, A8492/S7562 of the 2021-2022 legislative session, sponsored Assemblymember Khaleel Anderson and Senator Julia Salazar, would establish a \"Purple Alert\" to notify the public of missing victims of domestic violence by unifying the resources of the Division of Criminal Services, Department of Transportation, and appropriate state agencies to inform the public along with private or governmental entities who participate in the dissemination of urgent public information; and\n      Whereas, Open lines of communication between law enforcement, victims and their families, and the public are necessary during ongoing investigations into cases of missing persons; and\n      Whereas, The legislation mandates the use of interagency collaboration and the urgent dissemination of information to investigate and provide for the safe rescue of vulnerable victims of domestic violence; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the New York state legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, legislation, to create a \"purple alert system\" for missing victims of domestic violence.\n\n\nEA\nLS 10855, LS 12162, LS 12163\n1/11/2023",
