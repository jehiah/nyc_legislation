Alumnae Chapter to host Deltas and policymakers in forums, briefings, and advocacy skills workshops focused on local and national issues important to Black women and Black communities; and \n      Whereas, Delta Sigma Theta was recognized by the United Nations as a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) and, as a result, is able to offer expert analysis on issues relevant to the status of women and children worldwide ; and \n      Whereas, Since 1995, U.S. presidents have annually proclaimed March as Women's History Month to celebrate the achievements of women in the U.S. in many fields, including social activism; and \n      Whereas, U.S. President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. issued a proclamation on February 28, 2022, for Women's History Month, which included his statement that \"Black women fought to end slavery, advocate for civil rights, and pass the Voting Rights Act\" and that \"[s]uffragists helped pass the 19the Amendment to the Constitution so that no American could be denied a vote on the basis of sex\"; and \n      Whereas, President Biden continued that \"despite the progress being made, women and girls-especially women and girls of color-still face systemic barriers to full participation and wider gaps in opportunity and equality\"; and \n      Whereas, The designation of a day is fitting to commemorate the early days of Delta Sigma Theta advocacy and the continued impact that Delta advocacy can have on NYC communities, especially Black communities; now, therefore, be it\n\tResolved, That the Council of the City of New York recognizes the contributions of Delta Sigma Theta to public service by designating March 3 annually as Delta Day in the City of New York.\n\n\nLS #11730 and #12127\n1/24/23\nRHP\n2",
