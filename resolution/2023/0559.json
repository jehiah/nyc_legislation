  "Text": "By Council Members Menin, Sanchez, Powers, Abreu, Marte, Far�as, Restler, Hanif and Ung (at the request of the Manhattan Borough President)\n\n\n      Whereas, The Department of Buildings (DOB) requires that a property owner install a sidewalk shed when constructing a building taller than 40 feet tall, when demolishing a building taller than 25 feet, and whenever a building fa�ade threatens the safety of pedestrians; and\n      Whereas, As of March, 2023, there were more than 9,000 sidewalk sheds in the city of New York, which collectively cover more than two million linear feet, and more than 230 of these sheds had been installed for over five years; and\n      Whereas, Sidewalk sheds should be installed for no longer than the period of time required to repair an unsafe building fa�ade, as sidewalk sheds may accumulate garbage, congest sidewalks, become an eyesore, and threaten public safety if not adequately maintained; and\n      Whereas, Local Law 10 of 1980 and Local Law 11 of 1997, which established the Fa�ade Inspection and Safety Program, require that a qualified professional inspect the fa�ade of a building with more than six stories and file a technical fa�ade report to the DOB at least once every five years; and\n      Whereas, If the building's fa�ade is found to be unsafe, then the building owner must install a sidewalk shed and either repair the building fa�ade within a specified period of time or apply for an extension of time from the DOB; and\n      Whereas, Property owners who do not repair an unsafe building fa�ade condition in the allotted amount of time may receive a civil fine of $1,000 per month, plus an additional fine per linear foot of sidewalk shed that increases in amount with each year that the sidewalk shed remains installed, as specified in the Rules of the City of New York Section 103-04(d)(3); and\n      Whereas, In practice, sidewalk sheds often remain installed past the time allotted by the DOB when, for example, the cost to repair the fa�ade exceeds the cost of the penalty, the property owner cannot afford to repair the fa�ade, or the property owner cannot repair the building fa�ade without entry to an adjoining property whose owner who refuses to grant such entry; and\n      Whereas, When a property owner cannot make necessary repairs, such as repairs to a building fa�ade, without entry to an adjoining property, and the adjoining owner refuses to grant such entry, then the property owner may petition a court to obtain a license to enter the adjoining property, as specified in New York State Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law (RPAPL) Section 881; and\n      Whereas, The legal proceedings necessary to obtain a license to enter an adjoining property may take months or longer, depending on a court's schedule, which may extend the duration of time for which a building fa�ade remains in an unsafe condition and requires the continuance of a sidewalk shed; and\n      Whereas, S.1305, introduced by State Senator Leroy Comrie, and companion bill A.1321, introduced by Assembly Member Jenifer Rajkumar, would amend RPAPL �881 to require that the property owner both compensate the adjoining owner for the use of the adjoining property and include the adjoining property on any relevant insurance policy, and additionally, would amend RPAPL �881 to specify that a court shall grant a license to enter an adjoining property for the purposes of building fa�ade repair; and\n      Whereas, These amendments would create a predictable framework that may shorten the duration of legal proceedings over access to adjoining properties while protecting the rights of adjoining owners, which would decrease the amount of time for which pedestrians must be protected from unsafe building fa�ade conditions with a sidewalk shed; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved that the Council of the city of New York calls on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.1305/A.1321, which establishes a legal framework that may facilitate the timely removal of sidewalk sheds.\n\n\nAGB\nLS #12612\n4/5/2023",
