Magnarelli and pending in the New York State Assembly, and companion bill S.3380 introduced by Senator Timothy M. Kennedy and pending in the New York State Senate, seeks to amend the Tax Law, in relation to providing credits against the tax imposed upon employers providing certain day care services to the children of its employees; and\n      Whereas, A.200/S.3380 would provide employers with a tax credit in an amount not to exceed 20% of expenses incurred in providing day care services to the children and wards of its employees and in training persons employed by the taxpayer or third party provider rendering such services; and\n      Whereas, A.200/S.3380 stipulates that to receive the tax credit, programs or facilities providing day care services must be licensed accordingly; and\n      Whereas, A.200/S.3380 incentivizes New York employers to provide child care options for their employees; and\n      Whereas, Investing in child care means investing in working families and the economy; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, A.200/S.3380 to provide a business tax credit for employer provided day care.\n\n\nLS #12227\n03/28/2023\nRLB",
