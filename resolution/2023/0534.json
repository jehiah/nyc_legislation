  "Text": "Whereas, The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), largely in collaboration with\nthe New York City Department of Education (DOE), distributes student MetroCards to eligible students at the beginning of each semester, and as needed during the school year; and\n      Whereas, Student MetroCards provide three free rides via MTA subways and/or buses each school day, between 5:30 a.m. and 8:30 p.m., and include a free transfer between buses, or between the subway and local, limited or Select bus service; and\n      Whereas, A student MetroCard is only to be used by the student to whom it was assigned, is only permitted to be used during the specified times, and even then is only permitted to be used when the student's school is open for classes; and \n      Whereas, Students that are eligible for student MetroCards include those that are in grades K through 12, who live more than .5 miles from their school, and who do not have yellow school bus service available; and \n      Whereas, In addition, some students at private and parochial schools have access to student MetroCards; and \n      Whereas, About one million students of New York City's public, private and parochial schools utilize student MetroCards; and \n      Whereas, Student MetroCards provide an important service to New York City students, allowing them to move from home to school, and then to school-related activities, for free; and \n      Whereas, Although helpful, students and families have expressed concerns that the student MetroCard program does not currently serve them in the most effective way possible, expressing that the current time restraints placed on student MetroCards limits opportunities for students to engage in afterschool activities; and \n      Whereas, According to a May 2020 \"Student MetroCard Policy Report\" by Assemblymember Harvey Epstein's 74th District Youth Council and in partnership with the Coalition for Student Transit Justice, in a survey of 881 New York City students, 73.2% of those surveyed responded that they take part in afterschool activities that require public transit after 8:30 p.m., the current cut-off time after which a student MetroCard cannot be utilized; and\n      Whereas, In addition, students who utilize their student MetroCard on a day when school is not in session may be fined $100, have their MetroCard revoked, or face additional penalties under current New York City Transit Authority rules and regulations; and \n      Whereas, A.3723, introduced by New York State Assemblymember Harvey Epstein, and S.759, introduced by New York State Senator John C. Liu, would establish a student fare program that would provide three free fares each weekday between 5:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m., effectively expanding the time window during which students would be allowed to utilize their student MetroCard; and \n      Whereas, A.816, introduced by New York State Assemblymember Epstein, and S.879, introduced by New York State Senator Liu, would prohibit the MTA from promulgating any rules or regulations that penalize a student for using their student MetroCard on a non-school day; and \n      Whereas, As New York City students deserve to be able to have cost-free transportation to and from home, school and school-related activities at times that they truly need it, while also not being penalized harshly by utilizing their student MetroCard during times when they still need to get to and from home and school activities despite school otherwise being closed for the day, A.3723/S.759 and A.816/S.879 should be adopted; now, therefore, be it \n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the New York State Legislature to pass, and the New York State Governor to sign, A.3723/S.759 and A.816/S.879, which would extend the hours of use for student MetroCards in New York City and would prohibit the Metropolitan Transportation Authority from promulgating rules or regulations that penalize a student for using a student MetroCard when school is not in session.\n      \n\nKK\nLS 10520\n3/16/23",
