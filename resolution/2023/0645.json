Biden, Jr., issued a statement marking the observation of Father's Day on June 19, 2022, saying that his own father had taught him \"to treat all people with dignity, and that there is no higher calling than to be a good parent\"; and \n      Whereas, It is fitting that NYC recognize the indispensable role that fathers play in neighborhoods of all demographics in shaping the lives of NYC's children and nurturing the next generation of NYC's leaders, especially in underserved neighborhoods where fathers are critical to the social, emotional, educational, and future career success of their children; now, therefore, be it\n\tResolved, That the Council of the City of New York designate June as Fatherhood Recognition Month annually in the City of New York to honor and support the contributions of fathers to family and community life.\n\n\nLS #12766\n6/15/2023\nRHP\n3",
