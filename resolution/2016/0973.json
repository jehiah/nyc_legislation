  "Text": "By Council Members Cabrera and Rodriguez\n\n\tWhereas, In April 2011, the New York City Administration of Children's Services (\"ACS\") began a pilot program called Positive Alternative Towards Home (\"PATH\"); and \n\tWhereas, The PATH program involves using electronic monitoring so that youth who would normally be in secure detention as alleged Juvenile Offenders (\"JO's\") can return to the community as they await adjudication; and\n\tWhereas, Many young offenders can be effectively rehabilitated through community-based supervision and intervention; and\n\tWhereas, The PATH program includes support and supervision from community-based organizations; and\n\tWhereas, Residential care is costly and community based alternative programs that\ndivert juvenile offenders from residential care are cost effective and improve outcomes for children; and\n\tWhereas, The goal of PATH is to keep youth in the community pending adjudication while minimizing risk to the community; and\n\tWhereas, PATH is a performance-based program where youth can significantly influence their outcome based on their behavior; and\n\tWhereas, An electronic monitoring device is used to measure the youth's compliance with curfew and other court-ordered conditions and restrictions, as well as to monitor school and program attendance; and\n\tWhereas, The PATH program was piloted by Judge Eduardo Padro in the Manhattan Supreme Court in 2011 and has since been applied to about 35 young people with an approximate 50% success rate; and\n\tWhereas, According to testimony by ACS representatives at a hearing of the Council's Juvenile Justice Committee on September 25, 2015, any Supreme Court Judge can use this program but Judge Padro is the only Supreme Court Judge in New York City who uses the program today; and\n\tWhereas, There is concern that the PATH program will end when Judge Padro retires this year; and\n\tWhereas, The PATH program is in line with ACS' efforts to step down youth from secure detention to non-secure detention as well as from detention to community-based alternatives; and\n\tWhereas, It must be a priority for New York City to maintain public safety while providing effective alternatives to incarceration that allow court involved youth to remain safely with their families in their communities; now, therefore, be it\n\tResolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the New York City Administration for Children's Services to fund and Criminal Court Judges to use the PPositive Alternative Towards Home program.\n\n_____\nBG\nLS 6351\n12/10/15",
