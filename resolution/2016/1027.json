  "Text": "By Council Members Cabrera, Cohen and Crowley \n\n      Whereas, Dyslexia is a language-based learning disability that is neurological in origin and which results in difficulties with reading and other language skills such as spelling, writing, and pronouncing words; and\n      Whereas, Dyslexia is the most prevalent and well-recognized of the subtypes of specific learning disabilities, according to the National Center for Learning Disabilities; and\n      Whereas, The International Dyslexia Association estimates that perhaps as many as 15-20% of the population as a whole have some of the symptoms of dyslexia; and \n      Whereas, However, according to the National Center for Learning Disabilities, only about one quarter of our nation's school-age population with learning disabilities have been formally identified, while the vast majority struggle due to unidentified and unaddressed learning and attention issues; and\n      Whereas, Research shows that if students are not reading on grade level by third grade, they are unlikely to catch up to their peers; and\n      Whereas, A study at Hunter College of the City University of New York found that students who can't read on grade level by 3rd grade are four times less likely to graduate by age 19 than those who do read proficiently by that time; and\n      Whereas, Failure to adequately address the needs of students with dyslexia and related language-based learning disorders can lead not only to school failure, but also to social and emotional problems and other negative life consequences; and\n      Whereas, For instance, some researchers have found a high incidence of dyslexia in prison populations, such as 48% of inmates in one Texas prison; and\n      Whereas, Key to overcoming dyslexia and related language-based learning disorders is early identification of and intervention for dyslexic students; and\n      Whereas, A.1480, sponsored by Assemblymember Jo Anne Simon, and its companion bill S.2534, sponsored by Senator Martin Golden, would require school districts to diagnose students as having dyslexia, to acknowledge the diagnosis on their Individual Education Plans (IEP), and to provide dyslexic students with teachers trained to instruct such students; and  \n      Whereas, More specifically, A.1480 and S.2534 would authorize the commissioner of education to certify or require training of teachers and school administrators in the area of dyslexia and related disorders; and  \n      Whereas, In addition, A.1480 and S.2534 would provide that, following the review of pertinent data and information, if a committee or subcommittee of special education believes that a student may have dyslexia, the student must be sent to an evaluation for dyslexia or related learning disorder; and  \n      Whereas, Further, the legislation would provide that if a student is determined to have dyslexia, the recommendations on programs or placement for the student must be made by a team that is knowledgeable in instructing children with dyslexia; and  \n      Whereas, Finally, A.1480 and S.2534 would require a school district to provide a teacher trained in dyslexia to any student who has been determined to have dyslexia or related learning disorder; and  \n      Whereas, Children need the basic ability to read and write to become successful and the consequences of an inadequate education have a huge impact on our society; and  \n      Whereas, This legislation will improve school conditions so that children with dyslexia and related learning disabilities can have an equal opportunity to learn and become college and career ready; and  \n      Whereas, In the long run, it will help save money for both the State and City and improve the lives of the students affected with these learning disabilities; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the New York State Legislature to pass and the Governor to sign A.1480/S.2534, legislation regarding the certification or training of teachers, administrators and instructors in the area of dyslexia and related disorders.\n\n\nLS# 7806\nJA\n3/27/17",
