Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary:\n(a) The Exemption shall terminate if HPD determines at any time that (i) the Exemption Area is not being operated in accordance with the requirements of Article XI of the Private Housing Finance Law, (ii) the Exemption Area is not being operated in accordance with the requirements of the HPD Regulatory Agreement, (iii) the Exemption Area is not being operated in accordance with the requirements of any other agreement with, or for the benefit of, the City of New York, (iv) the Exemption Area is conveyed to a new owner without the prior written approval of HPD, or (v) the construction or demolition of any private or multiple dwelling on the Exemption Area has commenced without the prior written consent of HPD.

If the noncompliance specified in such notice is not cured within the time period specified therein, the Exemption shall prospectively terminate.\n(b) The Exemption shall apply to all land in the Exemption Area, but shall only apply to buildings on the Exemption Area that exist on the Effective Date. \n(c) Nothing herein shall entitle the HDFC to a refund of any real property taxes which accrued and were paid with respect to the Exemption Area prior to the Effective Date.\n5. In consideration of the Exemption, the owner of the Exemption Area, for so long as the Exemption shall remain in effect, shall waive the benefits, if any, of any additional or concurrent exemption from or abatement of real property taxation which may be authorized under any existing or future local, state or federal law, rule, or regulation.\n\n\nOffice of the City Clerk,     }\t\t\t\nThe City of New York        } ss.:\n\n\nI hereby certify that the foregoing is a true copy of a Resolution passed by The Council of the City of New York on February 24, 2016, on file in this office.\n\n\n                                          _______________________\n                                          City Clerk, Clerk of Council",
