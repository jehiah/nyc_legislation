  "Text": "By Council Member Ferreras-Copeland\n\n      WHEREAS, the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development (\"HPD\") submitted to the Council its request dated February 29, 2016 that the Council take the following action regarding a housing project located (Block 12457, Lot 2; Block 12458, Lots 5 and 421) Queens, (\"Exemption Area\"): \n      \nApprove an exemption of the Project from real property taxes pursuant to Section 577 of the Private Housing Finance Law (the \"Tax Exemption\");\n\n      WHEREAS, the project description that HPD provided to the Council states that the purchaser of the Project (the \"Sponsor\") is a duly organized housing development fund company under Article XI of the Private Housing Finance Law;\n\n      WHEREAS, the Council has considered the financial implications relating to the Tax Exemption;\n\n      RESOLVED: \nThe Council hereby grants an exemption from real property taxes provided: \n\n1. For the purposes hereof, the following terms shall have the following meanings:\n\na. \"Company\" shall mean Montauk Housing LLC.\n\nb. \"Effective Date\" shall mean the later of (i) the date of conveyance of the Exemption Area to the HDFC, or (ii) the date that HPD and the Owner enter into the Regulatory Agreement.\n\nc. \"Exemption\" shall mean the exemption from real property taxation provided hereunder with respect to the Exemption Area. \n\nd. \"Exemption Area\" shall mean the real property located in the Borough of Queens, City and State of New York, identified as Block 12457, Lot 2 and Block 12458, Lots 5 and 421 on the Tax Map of the City of New York.\n\ne. \"Expiration Date\" shall mean the earlier to occur of (i) a date which is forty (40) years from the Effective Date, (ii) the date of the expiration or termination of the Regulatory Agreement, or (iii) the date upon which the Exemption Area ceases to be owned by either a housing development fund company or an entity wholly controlled by a housing development fund company.\n\nf. \"HDFC\" shall mean HP Montauk Apartments Housing Development Fund Company, Inc.\n\ng. \"HPD\" shall mean the Department of Housing Preservation and Development of the City of New York.\n\nh. \"Owner\" shall mean the HDFC and the Company.\n\ni. \"Regulatory Agreement\" shall mean a regulatory agreement between HPD and the Owner establishing certain controls upon the operation of the Exemption Area during the term of the Exemption.\n\nj. \"Shelter Rent\" shall mean the total rents received from the commercial  and residential occupants of the Exemption Area, including any federal subsidy (including, but not limited to, Section 8, rent supplements, and rental assistance), less the cost of providing to such occupants electricity, gas, heat, and other utilities.\n\nk. \"Shelter Rent Tax\" shall mean an amount equal to twelve percent (12%) of Shelter Rent.\n\n2.\tAll of the value of the property in the Exemption Area, including both the land and any improvements (excluding those portions, if any, devoted to business or commercial use), shall be exempt from real property taxation, other than assessments for local improvements, for a period commencing upon the Effective Date and terminating upon the Expiration Date.\n\n3.\tCommencing upon the Effective Date, and during each year thereafter until the Expiration Date, the Owner shall make real property tax payments in the sum of the Shelter Rent Tax. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the total annual real property tax payment by the Owner shall not at any time exceed the amount of real property taxes that would otherwise be due in the absence of any form of exemption from or abatement of real property taxation provided by an existing or future local, state, or federal law, rule or regulation.\n\n4.\tNotwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary:\n\na. The Exemption shall terminate if HPD determines at any time that (i) the Exemption Area is not being operated in accordance with the requirements of Article XI of the Private Housing Finance Law, (ii) the Exemption Area is not being operated in accordance with the requirements of the Regulatory Agreement, (iii) the Exemption Area is not being operated in accordance with the requirements of any other agreement with, or for the benefit of, the City of New York, (iv)  the Exemption Area is conveyed to a new owner without the prior written approval of HPD, or (v) the construction or demolition of any private or multiple dwelling on the Exemption Area has commenced without the prior written consent of HPD.  HPD shall deliver written notice of any such determination to the Owner and all mortgagees of record, which notice shall provide for an opportunity to cure of not less than sixty (60) days.  If the noncompliance specified in such notice is not cured within the time period specified therein, the Exemption shall prospectively terminate.\n\nb. The Exemption shall apply to all land in the Exemption Area, but shall only apply to buildings in the Exemption Area that exists on the Effective Date.\n\nc. Nothing herein shall entitle the HDFC to a refund of any real property taxes which accrued and were paid with respect to the Exemption Area prior to the Effective Date.\n\nd. All previous resolutions, if any, providing an exemption from or abatement of real property taxation with respect to the Exemption Area are hereby revoked.\n\n5. In consideration of the Exemption, the owner of the Exemption Area, for so long as the Exemption shall remain in effect, shall  waive the benefits of any additional or concurrent exemption from or abatement of real property taxation which may be authorized under any existing or future local, state or federal law, rule or regulation.\n\n\nOffice of the City Clerk,     }\t\t\t\nThe City of New York        } ss.:\n\nI hereby certify that the foregoing is a true copy of a Resolution passed by The Council of the City of New York on June 21, 2016, on file in this office.\n\n                                          \n                                          _______________________\n                                          City Clerk, Clerk of Council",
