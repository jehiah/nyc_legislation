Roosevelt called it \"a date which will live in infamy,\" and the War in the Pacific did not conclude until September of 1945; and \n\tWhereas, According to the National World War II Museum, the United States ultimately lost more than 400,000 soldiers during WWII; and\n\tWhereas, Statistics from the Department of the Army show that the United States lost more than 100,000 soldiers in the Pacific Theater of World War II; and \n\tWhereas, The National World War II Museum has also found that just 620,000 of the 16 million Americans who served in World War II were still alive in 2016; and  \n\tWhereas, The magnitude of the sacrifices of the Greatest Generation, as well as the fact that their numbers are dwindling with the passage of time means that recognition of their heroism remains as pertinent as ever; and\n\t Whereas, Moreover, formal recognition of those who served our country with such distinction would reaffirm New York's commitment to its 210,000 veterans; now, therefore, be it \n\tResolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the City to recognize both the 75th anniversary of Pearl Harbor and the sacrifices of our military members during World War II on December 7th \n\nLS#9291 \n11/7/16\nMK",
