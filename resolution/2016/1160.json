  "Text": "By Council Member Cabrera\n      Whereas, Eating disorders are sometimes fatal mental illnesses that affect a person's typical eating behavior and involve extreme emotional attitudes and behaviors surrounding food; and\n      Whereas, Eating disorders include anorexia, bulimia, binge eating disorder and are sometimes associated with depression and anxiety; and\n      Whereas, According to the National Eating Disorder Association, in the United States, 20 million women and 10 million men suffer from an eating disorder at some point in their lives; and \n      Whereas, According to a 2011 report by the American Dietetic Association, eating disorders become increasingly severe the longer they go untreated, leading to severe health problems which are especially detrimental the earlier they develop, and can impede a child's ability to physically develop at a normal rate; and \n      Whereas, Eating disorders are the third most common chronic illness among adolescents and have the highest mortality rate of any mental illness; and \n      Whereas, According to the National Eating Disorder Association, nearly one-half of teenage girls and one-third of teenage boys use unhealthy weight control behaviors that include skipping meals, fasting, smoking cigarettes, vomiting and taking laxatives; and \n      Whereas, According to the National Institutes of Health, despite the prevalence of eating disorders, there is inadequate funding for research and the average research dollar spent in the United States per person is about $0.93; and \n      Whereas, In December 2015, Congresswoman Renee Ellmers introduced H.R. 4153, also known as Educating to Prevent Eating Disorders Act of 2015, which would create a three-year pilot program for schools with children in grades 6 through 8, that are selected, and would provide the necessary grant money to screen these children for eating disorders; and \n      Whereas,When eating disorders are treated at a young age, with the support of family and therapy, they are less likely to become as severe as they would be if left untreated; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the 114th Congress to pass and the President to sign, H.R. 4153, which would amend the Public Health Service Act to establish a pilot program to test the impact of early intervention on the prevention, management, and course of eating disorders.\nER\n6/13/16\nLS 8048",
