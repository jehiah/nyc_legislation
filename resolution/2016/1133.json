For the purposes hereof, the following terms shall have the following meanings:\na. \"Effective Date\" shall mean the later of (i) the date of conveyance of the Exemption Area to the HDFC, or (ii) the date that HPD and the Owner enter into the HPD Regulatory Agreement.\n\nb. \"Exemption\" shall mean the exemption from real property taxation provided hereunder.\n\nc. \"Exemption Area\" shall mean the real property located in the Borough of Manhattan, City and State of New York, identified as Block 277, Lot 4 on the Tax Map of the City of New York.\n\nd. \"Expiration Date\" shall mean the earlier to occur of (i) a date which is forty (40) years from the Effective Date, (ii) the date of the expiration or termination of the HPD Regulatory Agreement, or (iii) the date upon which the Exemption Area ceases to be owned by either a housing development fund company or an entity wholly controlled by a housing development fund company.\n\ne. \"HDFC\" shall mean Madison Street Housing Development Fund Corporation, Inc. \n\nf. \"HPD\" shall mean the Department of Housing Preservation and Development of the City of New York.\n\ng. \"HPD Regulatory Agreement\" shall mean the regulatory agreement between HPD and the Owner establishing certain controls upon the operation of the Exemption Area during the term of the Exemption.\n\nh. \"Owner\" shall mean the HDFC or any future owner of the Exemption Area.\n\n\n2. All of the value of the property in the Exemption Area, including both the land and any improvements (excluding those portions, if any, devoted to the business or commercial use), shall be exempt from real property taxation, other than assessments for local improvements, for a period commencing upon the Effective Date and terminating upon the Expiration Date.\n\n3. Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary:\n\na. The Exemption shall terminate if HPD determines at any time that (i) the Exemption Area is not being operated in accordance with the requirements of Article XI of the Private Housing Finance law, (ii) the Exemption Area is not being operated in accordance with the requirements of the HPD Regulatory Agreement, (iii) the Exemption Area is not being operated in accordance with the requirements of any other agreement with, or for the benefit of, the City of New York, (iv) the Exemption Area is conveyed to a new owner without the prior written approval of HPD, or (v) the demolition of any private or multiple dwelling on the Exemption Area has commenced without the prior written consent of HPD. HPD shall deliver written notice of any such determination to the Owner and all mortgagees of record, which notice shall provide for an opportunity to cure of not less than sixty (60) days.
