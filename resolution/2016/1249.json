  "Text": "By Council Member Wills\n\n      Whereas, Currently, New York State does not have an established baseline standard for drug testing individuals who are on probation or parole; and\n      Whereas, While State correctional institutions test probationers and parolees for illegal substance use, such as marijuana and cocaine, these institution do not test for synthetic cannabinoids; and\n      Whereas, Synthetic cannabinoids are generally marketed as legal and typically consist of plant material coated by chemicals, which are supposed to mimic THC, the active chemical compound in marijuana; and\n      Whereas, According to the New York State Department of Health, hospitals located in the State have recently experienced a dramatic increase in emergency department visits for adverse health effects due to synthetic cannabinoids; and\n      Whereas, In response to this alarming public health risk, New York City enacted local laws criminalizing the sale and production of synthetic cannabinoids; and\n      Whereas, A.8575, introduced by New York State Assembly Member Edward P. Ra and pending in the Assembly, seeks to create a set of uniform minimum standards for drug testing parolees and probationers, which would include synthetic cannabinoids; and\n      Whereas, A.8575 would permit local probation departments, municipalities, and regional departments of parole, to employ stricter drug testing policies; and\n      Whereas, A.8575 would identify individuals on probation and parole who see synthetic cannabinoids as a way to cheat current drug tests; and\n      Whereas, Many of these probationers and parolees subsequently become one of the many victims of synthetic cannabinoids that result in drug-related hospital admissions; and\n      Whereas, Identifying these individuals would help lower the number of people going to New York State hospital emergency rooms due to the use of  synthetic drugs; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the New York State Legislature to pass and the Governor to sign A.8575, which seeks to create a uniform baseline standards for drug testing, including synthetic cannabinoids, for individuals who are on probation or parole.\n\nWJH\nLS 6114\n4/4/2016",
