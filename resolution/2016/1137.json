  "Text": "By Council Members Rosenthal and Chin\n\n\n      Whereas, Pursuant to Section 314 of the New York City Charter, concurrent action by the Council of the City of New York and the Procurement Policy Board is necessary to establish dollar limits for the procurement of goods, services, construction or construction-related materials that may be made without competition or public advertisement-better known as the small purchase limits; and\n      Whereas, In June 2002, the Council adopted the rule amendments of the Procurement Policy Board raising the small purchase limits for construction and construction-related services from fifty thousand dollars to one hundred thousand dollars, and in May 2004, the Council adopted the rule amendments of the Procurement Policy Board raising the small purchase limits for goods and services to one hundred thousand dollars; and\n      Whereas, The small purchase limit has remained at one hundred thousand dollars for all procurement categories since 2004; and\n      Whereas, The Council finds it necessary and desirable to streamline the procurement process and reduce the processing time for all procurements while maintaining the integrity of the procurement system, and raising the small purchase limit to two hundred thousand dollars for all categories will allow agencies to process a greater number of procurements in a more efficient and cost-effective manner; and\n      Whereas, Recognizing that such efficiencies must not compromise the integrity of the procurement system, the Council of the City of New York calls upon the Mayor and Comptroller to vigilantly monitor agency small purchases under the new limits to ensure that they comply with citywide rules; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York establishes that the small purchase limit for goods, services, construction and construction-related services shall be two hundred thousand dollars upon adoption of a concurrent rule amendment by the Procurement Policy Board.    \n\n\n\nENB\nLS #5400\n6/16/2016 \n      2\n      \n      \n      1",
