Stutzman and Senator John Cornyn introduced H.R.923/S.498, known as the \"Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2015,\" and Representative Richard Nugent introduced H.R. 402,  known as the \"National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act of 2015\"; and  \n      Whereas, H.R.923/S.498 and H.R.402 would amend the United States Code to authorize an individual who is not prohibited from possessing, transporting, shipping, or receiving a firearm under federal law, who is entitled and not prohibited from carrying a concealed firearm in his or her state of residence or who is carrying a valid state license or permit to carry a concealed weapon, and who is carrying a government-issued photographic identification document, to carry a concealed handgun in any state in accordance with the restrictions of that state; and\n      \tWhereas, H.R.923/S.498 and H.R.402 would permit an individual to carry and conceal a handgun in New York State even if the license he or she holds is from another state with less stringent licensing standards; and\n      \tWhereas, H.R.923/S.498 and H.R.402 would therefore undermine the strict New York State and City licensing standards and create a loophole for those seeking to carry and conceal handguns; and           \n\tWhereas, H.R.923/S.498 and H.R.402 would allow concealed carry permit holders from outside New York State and City to freely carry their loaded handguns in crowded tourist destinations and bustling business areas; and\n\tWhereas, H.R.923/S.498 and H.R.402 would allow states with the weakest gun laws to dictate who may carry a handgun in New York State and City; and \n      \tWhereas, If H.R.923/S.498 and H.R.402 were enacted, the law would create serious and potentially life-threatening situations for law enforcement officers and make it difficult for an officer to verify the validity of such permits and distinguish legal from illegal handgun possession; and\n      Whereas, Each state and local municipality should be able to determine for itself who may carry a concealed handgun within its borders; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on Congress and the President to oppose H.R.923/S.498, known as the \"Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2015,\" and related bill H.R.402, known as the \"National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act of 2015,\" which would allow a resident from one state who has a license to carry a concealed handgun to lawfully carry his or her handgun in a different state, regardless of the licensing eligibility standards in the other state.\nLS# 7343\n3/16/2016\nDA",
