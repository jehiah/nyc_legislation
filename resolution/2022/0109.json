The study identified three potential alternative transit methods for the IBX: Conventional Rail; Light Rail Transit; or Bus Rapid Transit; and \n      Whereas, Each alternative would follow the 14-mile corridor with the Conventional Rail and Light Rail Transit trains running every five minutes during peak frequency while the Bus Rapid Transit would run every 2.5 minutes; and\n\tWhereas, With the Feasibility Study and Alternatives Analysis complete, the next step for the project would be for the MTA to conduct the environmental review process to evaluate the feasibility of the three potential alternatives for the IBX and to seek input from community members, elected officials and other stakeholders; and \n\t  Whereas, During her 2022 State of the State address, Governor Kathy Hochul indicated her intention to move forward with the expansion of the IBX and directed the MTA to begin its environmental review process; now, therefore, be it \n\tResolved, That the Council of the City of New York, supports the continued exploration and feasibility evaluation of the proposed Interborough Express.  \n\nRA\nLS #7378\n4/4/2022",
