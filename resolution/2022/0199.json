Bush on June 5, 2006; and\n      Whereas, According to Congresswoman Barbara Lee, Caribbean Heritage Month is crucial because Caribbean Americans bring tremendous pride, love, and dedication to this nation, and their hard work uplifts our nation and brings communities together; and\n      Whereas, New York City, which is home to numerous Caribbean American communities, should follow the federal government's example and officially recognize June as Caribbean Heritage Month; and\n      Whereas, As reported by AM New York, the multiplicity of the Caribbean community, comprised of nearly 30 countries and with half a dozen commonly spoken languages, is a vibrant example of what makes New York City distinct; and\n      Whereas, According to Shelley Worrell, founder of Caribbeing, an organization that highlights and celebrates Caribbean culture in the city, \"New York is the Caribbean capital of the world[, and it's] the largest and most diverse Caribbean community outside of the Caribbean itself\"; and  \n      Whereas, While Caribbean Heritage month would serve as a time to celebrate Caribbean communities, it could also be an opportunity for individuals to engage in educational activities to better understand and to reflect on the importance of Caribbean culture, individuals, and institutions; and\n      Whereas, Caribbean New Yorkers must be recognized for their impact on the City, including their work during the COVID-19 pandemic, which disproportionately impacted immigrant, Black, and Latino/x communities, including Caribbean communities; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York declares June Caribbean Heritage Month. \n\nEB \nLS 8977 & 6031\n05.10.2022",
