No. 67), a zoning map amendment to eliminate C1-2 and C2-2 districts, change R4, R4-1, R5, C3 and C8-1 Districts to R3A, R4-1, R6A, and C3A Districts and establish C2-4 Districts and a Special Coastal Risk District (CR); N 220233 ZRQ (L.U. No. 68), a zoning text amendment to establish an MIH Area and Special Coastal Risk District (CR-5); C 220235 PPQ (L.U. No. 69), a disposition of city-owned property; and C 220237 HUQ (L.U. No. 71), an amendment to the Edgemere Urban Renewal Plan (URP);\n\n      WHEREAS, the City Planning Commission has certified its unqualified approval of UDAAP pursuant to Article 16 of the General Municipal Law;\n\n      WHEREAS, the Decision is subject to review and action by the Council pursuant to Section 197-d of the City Charter;\n      \n      WHEREAS, by letter dated May 24, 2022 and submitted to the Council on May 24, 2022, HPD submitted its requests (the \"HPD Requests\") respecting the Application including the submission of the project summary for the Project (the \"Project Summary\");\n\n      WHEREAS, upon due notice, the Council held a public hearing on the Application and Decision and the HPD Requests on June 7, 2022;\n\n      WHEREAS, the Council has considered the land use and financial implications and other policy issues relating to the Application; and\n\n\tWHEREAS, the Council has considered the relevant environmental issues, including the Positive Declaration issued December 18th, 2020 (CEQR No. 21HPD009Q) and a Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for which a Notice of Completion was issued on April 29, 2022, in which potential significant adverse impacts related to hazardous materials, air quality, and noise would be avoided through the placement of (E) designations (E-655) on the project site.  The original application as analyzed in the FEIS identified significant adverse impacts related to community facilities (early childhood programs), open space (active recreation), transportation (traffic, transit, and safety), air quality (mobile sources), and construction (noise) at certain locations, and the identified significant adverse impacts and proposed mitigation measures are summarized in Chapter 19, \"Mitigation\" and Chapter 20, \"Alternatives\" of the FEIS.\n       \nRESOLVED:\n\n\tHaving considered the FEIS with respect to the Decision and Application, the Council finds that:\n \t\n1. The FEIS meets the requirements of 6 N.Y.C.R.R. Part 617; \n\n2. Consistent with social, economic and other essential considerations, from among the reasonable alternatives thereto, the action is one which minimizes or avoids adverse environmental impacts to the maximum extent practicable; and \n\n3. The adverse environmental impacts disclosed in the FEIS will be minimized or avoided to the maximum extent practicable by incorporating, as conditions to the approval, those mitigation measures that were identified as practicable.\n\n      The Decision, together with the FEIS constitute the written statement of facts, and of social, economic and other factors and standards that form the basis of this determination, pursuant to 6 N.Y.C.R.R. �617.11(d).\n\n      Pursuant to Section 197-d of the New York City Charter, based on the environmental determination and the consideration described in the report C 220236 HAQ and incorporated by reference herein, and the record before the Council, the Council approves the Decision of the City Planning Commission and the HPD Requests.\n\n      Pursuant to Article 16 of the General Municipal Law of the New York State, based on the environmental determination and the consideration described in the report C 220236 HAQ and incorporated by reference herein, the Council approves the Decision of the City Planning Commission and the HPD Requests.\n\n      The Council finds that the present status of the Area tends to impair or arrest the sound growth and development of the City of New York and that a designation of the Project as an urban development action area project is consistent with the policy and purposes stated in Section 691 of the General Municipal Law.\n\n      The Council approves the designation of the Area as an urban development action area pursuant to Section 693 of the General Municipal Law.\n\n      The Council approves the Project as an urban development action area project pursuant to Section 694 of the General Municipal Law and subject to the terms and conditions of the Project Summary.\n\n      The Council approves the disposition of the Disposition Area under Section 197-d of the New York City Charter, to a developer to be selected by the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development for the development of the Project consistent with the Project Summary.\n\n\nPROJECT SUMMARY\n\n\n1.\tPROGRAM:\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNew Construction Finance Programs \n\n2.\tPROJECT:\t\t\t\t\t\t\tResilient Edgemere\n\n3.\tLOCATION:\n\n\ta.\tBOROUGH:\t\t\t\t\t\tQueens\n\n\tb.\tCOMMUNITY DISTRICT:\t\t\t\t14\n\t\n\tc.\tCOUNCIL DISTRICT:\t\t\t\t31\n\n\td.\tDISPOSITION AREA:\t\t\t\tBLOCK\t\t\t\tLOT\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n15852 \t\t\t\t64\n15852 \t\t\t\t68\n15851 \t\t\t\t33\n15851 \t\t\t\t35\n15851 \t\t\t\t40\n15851 \t\t\t\t42\n15851 \t\t\t\t44\n15851 \t\t\t\t58\n15851 \t\t\t\t59\n15850 \t\t\t\t6\n15849 \t\t\t\t6\n15849 \t\t\t\t8\n15849 \t\t\t\t9\n15849 \t\t\t\t10\n15849 \t\t\t\t17\n15849 \t\t\t\t18\n15849 \t\t\t\t19\n15849 \t\t\t\t20\n15849 \t\t\t\t27\n15849 \t\t\t\t28\n15849 \t\t\t\t29\n15848 \t\t\t\t52\n15848 \t\t\t\t54\n15848 \t\t\t\t55\n15848 \t\t\t\t57\n15848 \t\t\t\t58\n15848 \t\t\t\t60\n15848 \t\t\t\t62\n15848 \t\t\t\t63\n15848 \t\t\t\t65\n15848 \t\t\t\t67\n15847 \t\t\t\t79\n15847 \t\t\t\t80\n15847 \t\t\t\t81\n15847 \t\t\t\t82\n15847 \t\t\t\t83\n15847 \t\t\t\t84\n15847 \t\t\t\t85\n15847 \t\t\t\t86\n15847 \t\t\t\t87\n15847 \t\t\t\t88\n15847 \t\t\t\t89\ndemapped roadbed of Beach 39th Street between Blocks 15848 and 15847\ndemapped roadbed of Beach 43rd Street between Blocks 15852 and 15851\n\t\n\n4.\tBASIS OF DISPOSITION PRICE:\t\t\tNominal. Sponsor will pay one dollar per lot and deliver an enforcement note and mortgage for the remainder of the appraised value (\"Land Debt\").  For a period of at least thirty (30) years following completion of construction, the Land Debt or the City's capital subsidy may be repayable out of resale or refinancing profits.  The remaining balance, if any, may be forgiven at the end of the term. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n5.\tTYPE OF PROJECT:\t\t\t\t\tNew Construction\n\n6.\tAPPROXIMATE NUMBER OF BUILDINGS:\t5 multifamily residential and/or mixed-use buildings\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n7.\tAPPROXIMATE NUMBER OF UNITS:\t\t530 \n\n8.\tHOUSING TYPE:\t\t\t\t\t\tRental and/or Cooperative Units. \nFor cooperative units, if any affordable homeownership unit remains unsold at the end of the marketing period and HPD determines in writing that (i) a sale is not feasible within a reasonable time, and (ii) a rental fallback is the best available alternative, then Sponsor may operate units as rental housing in accordance with the written instructions of HPD.\n\n9.\tESTIMATE OF INITIAL RENTS/PRICES:\t\tRents will be affordable to households with annual household incomes between 30% and 120% of the area median income (AMI). All affordable rental units will be subject to rent stabilization. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSales prices for any cooperative units will be affordable to families with annual household incomes between 80% and 130% of AMI.\n\n10.\tINCOME TARGETS:\t\t\t\t\t\tFor rental units, 30% to 130% of AMI\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFor cooperative units, 80% to 130% of AMI\n\n11. \tLIENS FOR LAND DEBT/CITY SUBSIDY:\t\tFor any cooperative units, each of the Land Debt and the amount of any construction financing provided through loans from the City (\"City Subsidy\") will be secured by a mortgage on the Disposition Area. Upon conversion to a cooperative, the HDFC cooperative will repay the Land Debt and City Subsidy, if any, attributable to the property by delivering a note and mortgage and/or conditional grant agreement to the City. At such time, HPD may unsecure or forgive all or a portion of the Land Debt, and unsecure, but not forgive, all or a portion of the City Subsidy, based on the appraised value of a homeownership unit and/or, in the case of forgiveness of Land Debt, if HPD determines that the forgiveness is necessary to reduce the taxable consideration for a unit. The sum evidenced by the note and secured by the mortgage will be reduced to zero upon maturity of the Land Debt and City Subsidy, respectively, if the owner has complied with the program's restrictions.\n\n12.\tPROPOSED FACILITIES:\t\t\t\t\tUp to approximately 54,665 square feet of commercial and/or community facility space\n\n13.\tPROPOSED CODES/ORDINANCES:\t\tNone\n\n14.\tENVIRONMENTAL STATUS:\t\t\t\tEnvironmental Impact Statement\n\n15.\tPROPOSED TIME SCHEDULE:\t\t\tTo be developed in phases.
