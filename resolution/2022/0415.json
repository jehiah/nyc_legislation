  "Text": "Whereas, Although the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 on the World Trade Center in New York City (NYC), at the Pentagon in our nation's capital, and in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, were the deadliest terror attacks ever launched against our nation, the people of the United States (US) stood united against the terrorists and in support of the attacks' immediate and long-term victims, including by joining the US military to remind the world of our strength of character; and \n      Whereas, The September 11 Day of Remembrance Act (S.1472/H.R.2382), sponsored by US Senator Marsha Blackburn and US Representative Michael Lawler, calls for September 11 to be designated as a legal public holiday; and\n      Whereas, NYC residents have a lasting special connection to that never-to-be-forgotten day, whether as private citizens who observed the collapse of the Twin Towers, or as heroic first responders who rushed to the site without regard for their own safety, or as family members and friends of those who perished at that site; and\n      Whereas, A generation of Americans is now too young to remember the events of September 11 firsthand, though it continues to shape their lives in so many ways; and\n      Whereas, Thousands of NYC children and youth are part of the generation that were born into families of September 11 victims, but never knew their family members taken so senselessly; and \n      Whereas, Establishing September 11 as a federal holiday allows Americans to set aside school and work for one day in order to give younger and older Americans-as well as future generations-time to reflect on the meaning and lasting effects of the terrorist attacks of September 11; and \n      Whereas, Establishing September 11 as an official Day of Remembrance would go beyond establishing it as Patriot Day, as designated in the joint resolution of the US Congress (H.J. Res. 71) on December 18, 2001, which calls on the President to issue a yearly proclamation, including the observance of a moment of silence and the flying of flags at half-staff; and \n      Whereas, An official Day of Remembrance would go beyond Public Law No. 111-13 (April 21, 2019), in which the US Congress requested that September 11 be recognized each year as a National Day of Service and Remembrance to demonstrate the compassion and selflessness of the American people as they serve others in need; and \n      Whereas, An official Day of Remembrance would go beyond New York State's current legislation (S.4166A/A.1801B), signed by Governor Andrew Cuomo in 2019, which allows for a moment of silence in schools to commemorate the terrorist attacks and encourage classroom discussion; and \n      Whereas, An official Day of Remembrance gives all New Yorkers time to honor the almost 3,000 innocent victims, including hundreds of first responders, who died on September 11 and allows family members, in particular, quiet time to grieve the continued loss of loved ones; now, therefore, be it\n\tResolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the United States Congress to pass, and the President to sign, the September 11 Day of Remembrance Act.\n\n\nLS #10781\n8/29/23\nRHP\n\n\n\n\n\n2",
