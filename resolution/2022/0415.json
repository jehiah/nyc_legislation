Res. 71) on December 18, 2001, which calls on the President to issue a yearly proclamation, including the observance of a moment of silence and the flying of flags at half-staff; and \n      Whereas, An official Day of Remembrance would go beyond Public Law No. 111-13 (April 21, 2019), in which the US Congress requested that September 11 be recognized each year as a National Day of Service and Remembrance to demonstrate the compassion and selflessness of the American people as they serve others in need; and \n      Whereas, An official Day of Remembrance would go beyond New York State's current legislation (S.4166A/A.1801B), signed by Governor Andrew Cuomo in 2019, which allows for a moment of silence in schools to commemorate the terrorist attacks and encourage classroom discussion; and \n      Whereas, An official Day of Remembrance gives all New Yorkers time to honor the almost 3,000 innocent victims, including hundreds of first responders, who died on September 11 and allows family members, in particular, quiet time to grieve the continued loss of loved ones; now, therefore, be it\n\tResolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the United States Congress to pass, and the President to sign, the September 11 Day of Remembrance Act.\n\n\nLS #10781\n8/29/23\nRHP\n\n\n\n\n\n2",
