Parker, and A.9731, introduced by NYS Assembly Member Khaleel M. Anderson, would allow commuter vans to accept hails from prospective passengers in the streets and would repeal certain provisions in New York City law, ultimately, resulting in increased access to affordable and effective transportation options for New York City residents, particularly those from areas underserved by current public transit..Title; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the New York State Legislature to pass, and the New York State Governor to sign, S.5320/A.9731, which would amend the administrative code of the city of New York to allow commuter vans to accept hails from prospective passengers in the street, and would repeal certain provisions of law relating thereto. \n \n\n\n\n\n\nKK\nLS 6933\n12/6/22\n\n1",
