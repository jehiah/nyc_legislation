  "Text": "Whereas, Commuter vans in New York City are motor vehicles with seating capacities of nine to 20 passengers that provide transportation on a prearranged regular daily basis, over non-specified or irregular routes between a residential zone and a work related central location, a mass transit facility, a shopping center or recreational facilities within New York City; and \n\tWhereas, The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) regulates and licenses commuter vans, van bases and van drivers in the City; and \n\tWhereas, As of May 16, 2022, according to the TLC, there were 18 authorized TLC-licensed bases for commuter vans, 123 TLC-licensed commuter van drivers, and 32 TLC-licensed commuter vans; and \n\tWhereas, Under current law, TLC-licensed commuter vans are not permitted to accept hails from prospective passengers in the street and consumers can only make use of the service if they have made arrangements for the service before-hand; and \n\tWhereas, Although commuter vans provide an important service in supplementing New York City's public transit system, particularly for those that live in transit deserts and areas that lack close, effective and affordable transit options, the current law that requires pre-arrangement of services limits the impact that commuter vans can have on the City; and \n\tWhereas, In addition, as the number of commuter vans, bases and drivers licensed by the TLC has decreased in recent years, allowing TLC-licensed commuter vans to accept hails from prospective passengers in the street would greatly help the industry; and \n\tWhereas, S.5320, introduced by New York State (NYS) Senator Kevin S. Parker, and A.9731, introduced by NYS Assembly Member Khaleel M. Anderson, would allow commuter vans to accept hails from prospective passengers in the streets and would repeal certain provisions in New York City law, ultimately, resulting in increased access to affordable and effective transportation options for New York City residents, particularly those from areas underserved by current public transit..Title; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the New York State Legislature to pass, and the New York State Governor to sign, S.5320/A.9731, which would amend the administrative code of the city of New York to allow commuter vans to accept hails from prospective passengers in the street, and would repeal certain provisions of law relating thereto. \n \n\n\n\n\n\nKK\nLS 6933\n12/6/22\n\n1",
