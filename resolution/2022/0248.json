Commencing upon the Effective Date, and during each year thereafter until December 31, 2033, the New Owner shall make real property tax payments in the sum of the Gross Rent Tax. Commencing on the Contract Rent Differential Commencement Date, and during each year thereafter until the Expiration Date, the New Owner shall make real property tax payments in the sum of the Contract Rent Differential Tax. \n\n4. Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary:\n\na. The New Exemption shall terminate if HPD determines at any time that (i) the Exemption Area is not being operated in accordance with the requirements of Article XI of the Private Housing Finance Law, (ii) the Exemption Area is not being operated in accordance with the requirements of the Regulatory Agreement, (iii) the Exemption Area is not being operated in accordance with the requirements of any other agreement with, or for the benefit of, the City of New York, (iv) any interest in the Exemption Area is conveyed or transferred to a new owner without the prior written approval of HPD, or (v) the construction or demolition of any private or multiple dwelling on the Exemption Area has commenced without the prior written consent of HPD.

Approve, pursuant to Section 125 of the PHFL, the termination of the Prior Exemption, which termination shall become effective one day preceding the conveyance of the Exemption Area from the Current Owner to the New Owner.\n\n7. Consent, pursuant to Section 123(4) of the PHFL, to the voluntary dissolution of the Current Owner.\n\n8. If the conveyance of the Exemption Area from the Current Owner to the New Owner does not occur either (i) within one day following the termination of the Prior Exemption, or (ii) on the same day as the voluntary dissolution of the Current Owner, then all of the approvals and consents set forth above shall be null and void, the dissolution of the Current Owner shall be rescinded, and both the obligations of the Current Owner to remain an Article V redevelopment company and the Prior Exemption shall be reinstated as though they had never been terminated or interrupted.\n\nOffice of the City Clerk,     }\nThe City of New York        } ss.:\n\nI hereby certify that the foregoing is a true copy of a Resolution passed by The Council of the City of New York on June 16, 2022 on file in this office.\n\n_______________________\nCity Clerk, Clerk of Council",
