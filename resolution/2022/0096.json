  "Text": "Whereas, According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a pregnancy-related death is defined as the death of a person while pregnant or within one year of the end of a pregnancy (regardless of the outcome or duration of the pregnancy) from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or incidental causes; and\n      Whereas, Data from the CDC find that about one-third of all pregnancy-related deaths occur one week to one year after a pregnancy ends; and\n      Whereas, In a report released in 2019, New York State was ranked 30th in the nation for its maternal mortality rate; and\n      Whereas, New York State had a maternal mortality rate for Black women of 52 deaths per 100,000 live births, compared to 16 deaths per 100,000 live births for white women during 2014-2016; and\n      Whereas, According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the postpartum period represents a time of increased vulnerabilities; and\n      Whereas, In addition to monitoring a person's physical wellbeing postpartum, it is important to maintain access to mental health and substance use disorder treatment services during this time; and \n      Whereas, Those with opioid use disorder relapse far more often in the postpartum period compared with during pregnancy and should have access to and continued use of treatment services; and\n      Whereas, New York State offers Medicaid to pregnant New York residents who meet income requirements, regardless of immigration status; and\n      Whereas, In the Medicaid for pregnancy program, babies receive health care services for at least one year after birth, but the pregnant individual only receives care for 60 days after the end of pregnancy; and\n      Whereas, S.1411B/A.307B, sponsored by Senator Gustavo Rivera and Assembly Member Richard Gottfried, would extend the coverage period for medical assistance to a period of one year beginning on the last day of pregnancy; and\n      Whereas, In New York State, over 50 percent of births were covered by Medicaid in 2018; and\n      Whereas, In 2019, about 56 percent of births in New York City were covered by Medicaid; and\n      Whereas, That year, approximately 77 percent of Hispanic (not of Puerto Rican ancestry), 67.5 percent of Puerto Rican, 66 of Black, and 55 percent Asian/Pacific Islander live births were covered by Medicaid, compared to 37 percent white live births; and\n      Whereas, According to a 2020 study comparing states that have expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act to nonexpansion states, Medicaid expansion was significantly associated with lower maternal mortality by 7.01 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births relative to nonexpansion states; and\n       Whereas, Medicaid expansion effects were concentrated among non-Hispanic Black mothers, suggesting that expansion could be contributing to decreasing racial disparities in maternal mortality; and\n      Whereas, In New York City, Black pregnant people are 8 to 12 times more likely to die due to pregnancy compared to their white counterparts; and\n      Whereas, According to the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), Black non-Latina women had the highest severe maternal morbidity rate (three times that of White non-Latina women), with rates also high among Puerto Rican and other Latina women compared to White non-Latina women; and\n      Whereas, The CDC has found that almost two-thirds of pregnancy-related deaths are preventable; and\n      Whereas, Extending Medicaid coverage past 60 days postpartum is a commonsense way to save lives and improve parent and child health outcomes and could help reduce stark racial disparities in maternal mortality; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the State Legislature to pass and the Governor to sign S.1411B/A.307B, which would expand Medicaid benefits to one year postpartum.\n      \nSession 12\nEB\nLS 5096\n03.04.2022\n\nSession 11\nCP\nLS #15870\nRes. 1500-2020",
