  "Text": "By Council Members Rivera, Louis, Hudson, Hanif, Brooks-Powers, Joseph, Nurse, The Speaker (Council Member Adams), Restler, Won, Narcisse, Avil�s, Ayala, Marte, Dinowitz, De La Rosa, Cab�n and Riley (in conjunction with the Brooklyn Borough President)\n\n\tWhereas, According to DONA International, a doula is a trained professional who provides continuous physical, emotional, and informational support to a pregnant person and the family before, during, and shortly after childbirth; and\n\tWhereas, Doulas have proven to be beneficial to pregnant people and their health; and \n      Whereas, Doulas act as important advocates, facilitating communication between providers and patients, providing culturally-competent and language-appropriate care to immigrant communities and communities of color they serve; and\n\tWhereas, According to the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's (DOHMH's) report The State of Doula Care in NYC 2019 (\"doula report\"), doula care has been associated with lower rates of Cesarean birth, preterm birth, low birthweight, and postpartum depression, as well as with increased rates of breastfeeding, and greater patient satisfaction with maternity care; and\n      Whereas, A 2017 report published by Cochrane reveals that people who had doula support were 39 percent less likely to have a caesarean section and 15 percent more likely to give birth without needing drugs or labor-inducing techniques; and\n      Whereas, According to Choices in Childbirth, a survey regarding doula care in New York City reveals that 72 percent of people reported that their doula helped them communicate their preferences and needs, while 80 percent of those surveyed reported that their doula helped them feel more empowered; and\n      Whereas, 83 percent of survey respondents reported having a doula made their labor and birth experience \"much better\" than if they had not used a doula, and it made them more relaxed before, during, and after birth; and\n      Whereas, 88 percent of this cohort reported that cost was an issue when opting to work with a doula; and\n      Whereas, According to DOHMH's doula report, the average cost of birth-doula services was $1,550 per client among doulas surveyed for the report, with a range of $225 to $5,000; and\n      Whereas, Doula services are generally not covered by Medicaid or private insurance; and\n      Whereas, Doula care should be more accessible, especially given the maternal mortality and morbidity rates in New York City as well as the inequitable health outcomes for people of color and infants of color, specifically those who are Black; and\n      Whereas, Of the 21 pregnancy-related deaths in New York City in 2017, 11 were of people who were Black and six were of people who were Latina, accounting for nearly every pregnancy-related death; and\n        Whereas, In New York City in 2017, the rate of severe maternal morbidity was highest among Black people (457.2 per 10,000 births), followed by people of other or multiple race(s) (399.6), people who are Latina (313.7), Asian/Pacific Islander (225.4), and, last, people who are white (187.9);
