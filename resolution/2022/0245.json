Wade was a landmark decision in which the Court ruled that a person may choose to have an abortion until a fetus becomes viable (usually between 24 and 28 weeks after conception), based on the right to privacy contained in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; and\n      Whereas, Nonetheless, access to abortion services has been obstructed across the United States in various ways, including blockades of health care facilities, restrictions on insurance coverage, medically unnecessary regulations and many more that neither confer any health benefit nor further the safety of abortion services; and \n      Whereas, According to the Center for Reproductive Rights, nearly 500 state laws restricting abortion have been enacted since 2011, nearly 90 percent of American counties are without a single abortion provider and five states are down to their last abortion clinic; and\n      Whereas, The harms of abortion restrictions fall especially heavily on people with low-income, immigrants, women of color, those in the LGBTQ+ community, people with disabilities, and other marginalized or multi-marginalized groups; and\n      Whereas, According to a study by Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health (ANSIRH), individuals who are forced to carry an unwanted pregnancy are more likely to experience intimate partner violence, health problems, poverty, and ongoing financial distress and eviction than those who are able to access wanted abortion care; and\n      Whereas, With a leaked draft opinion from the Supreme Court suggesting that Roe v. Wade is on the brink of being overturned in the highest court in the land, it is essential to enshrine the right to abortion access into federal law; and\n      Whereas, S.1975, sponsored by U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal, and H.R. 3755, sponsored by Representative Judy Chu, also known as the Women Health Protection Act (WHPA), would protect the federal right to abortion and would block the barrage of state bans and restrictions on abortion intended to impede or outright deny access; and\n      Whereas, The House of Representatives passed WHPA on September 24, 2021, yet the Senate has failed to move forward with the bill; and\n       Whereas, WHPA would protect a person's freedom to make decisions about their own reproductive health care and a health care provider's ability to provide the full range of reproductive health services, including abortion; and\n      Whereas, Reproductive justice is a human right that can and will be achieved when all people regardless of race, color, national origin, immigration status, sexual orientation, age, or disability status, have the economic, social, and political power and resources to define and make decisions about their bodies, health, sexuality, families, and communities; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the United States Senate to pass and the President to sign the Women's Health Protection Act.\n    \nVM\n5/23/2022\nLS#6203",
