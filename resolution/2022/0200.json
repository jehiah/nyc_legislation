  "Text": "Whereas,  In 1970, Jane Roe filed a lawsuit on behalf of herself and others against Dallas County Texas District Attorney Henry Wade, challenging a Texas law making abortion illegal except by a doctor's orders to save a woman's life; and \n      Whereas,  In the lawsuit, Roe argued that Texas's abortion laws were unconstitutionally vague and abridged her right of personal privacy as protected by the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments; and\n      Whereas,  On January 22, 1973, the United States (U.S) Supreme Court issued a 7-2 decision in favor of Jane Roe, ruling that women had a fundamental right to choose whether or not to have an abortion without excessive government restriction, thereby striking down Texas's abortion ban as unconstitutional; and\n      Whereas, Roe v. Wade held the U.S. Constitution provided a right to privacy protecting a person's right to choose, and also decided the right to abortion is not absolute and must be balanced against the government's interest in protecting health and prenatal life; and\n      Whereas, According to the World Health Organization (WHO), unsafe abortion is a leading but preventable cause of maternal deaths and morbidities around the world, and the proportion of unsafe abortions is significantly higher in countries with highly restrictive abortion laws than in countries with less restrictive laws; and  \n      Whereas,  According to the 2020 WHO list of essential health care services, comprehensive abortion care can be effectively managed by a wide range of health workers using medication or a surgical procedure and is deemed a safe health care intervention; and\n      Whereas, In 1970, New York State legalized abortion up to 24 weeks into a pregnancy, becoming the first state in the country to provide the freedom of choice for individuals to terminate their pregnancies regardless of residency; and \n      Whereas, On January 22, 2019, New York State enacted the Reproductive Health Act (RHA), removing abortion (as a homicide exception) from the State criminal code, codifying the rights to an abortion laid out in Roe v. Wade, and expanding the types of health care professionals permitted to practice abortion health services; and\n      Whereas, On June 24, 2022, in a 5-4 decision, the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, ending the landmark ruling that had established the constitutional right to abortion; and\n      Whereas, According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2019, 7,000 or nine percent of pregnancy termination procedures in New York State were for people from other states, and in preparation for the dismantling of Roe v.
