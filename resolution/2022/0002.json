  "Text": "Whereas, The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) \"On-Demand E-Hail Paratransit Pilot Program\" began in 2017 to serve New Yorkers with disabilities and seniors who use paratransit, by offering them the option to call a ride when and where they need it-\"on demand\"; and\n      Whereas, In 2019, the MTA expanded the pilot to double the number of participants, from 1,200 users to 2,400 users, by allowing NYC Transit's Access-a-Ride (AAR) program to provide more of its trips in taxis and for-hire vehicles (FHV), and extended the pilot through the end of the year; and\n      Whereas, While the MTA expanded the pilot, they also added severe restrictions, including the implementation of service caps of no more than 16 rides per month and capping the value per ride at $15 per trip, after which users would have to pay the remaining balance; and\n      Whereas, Such service caps place limits on the geographic mobility of users and imposes a greater financial burden; and\n      Whereas, No other MTA customer faces rationing of rides or limits on the distance they can travel, and it is inequitable and unjust for MTA to place these restrictions on paratransit users; and\n      Whereas, The current pilot is cost-effective and good for New York City's economy, as the average cost of an \"On-Demand\" paratransit ride is less than $41 and takes up only 1.7% of AAR's annual budget, while standard AAR rides cost more than $82; and\n      Whereas, Nearly 7 in 10 New Yorkers with a disability are unemployed, with poor transportation cited by community members as one of the primary reasons why they cannot secure employment, and reliable, \"On-Demand\" service significantly improves riders' access to jobs, education, and healthcare, and would help reverse this trend of unemployment; and\n      Whereas, The \"On-Demand\" pilot program has facilitated much-needed revenue for yellow and green taxicab drivers, many of whom face debt and unfair competition from ride-hailing services; and\n      Whereas, S.4037, sponsored by Senator Leroy Comrie, and A.5896, sponsored by Jeffrey Dinowitz, would reasonably and responsibly build upon the MTA On-Demand E-Hail Paratransit Pilot Program by continuing the program through March 31, 2023 with the following guidelines: (1) fares for services would be equal to the MTA base fare charge for subway and bus service; (2) the hours of services would be the same as other bus, subway, and paratransit services; and (3) the length and frequency of services would not be restricted; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls upon the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.4037/A.5896, legislation to extend and expand the scope of the MTA On-Demand E-Hail Paratransit Pilot Program.\n\n\nSession 12\nLS #3947\nNAB\n1/13/2022\n\n\nSession 11\nM.T.\nLS #13679/13680",
