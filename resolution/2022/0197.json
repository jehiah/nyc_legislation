Wade, which established a person's constitutional right to abortion; and \n      Whereas, Since the leak, advocates and policymakers have reignited their efforts to either protect or restrict abortion access; and \n      Whereas, According to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll released in 2020, a majority of the public do not want to see the Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade; and\n      Whereas, While most Republicans (57 percent) would like to see Roe overturned, larger majorities of Democrats (91 percent) and independents (70 percent) do not want it overturned; and\n      Whereas, Most people (67 percent) think state regulations on abortion providers or people seeking abortions are intended to make access to abortion more difficult as opposed \"to protecting the health and safety of women\" (32 percent); and \n      Whereas, According to a 2022 Pew Research Center survey, approximately six in 10 U.S. adults (61 percent) believe abortion should be legal in \"all or most cases\"; and \n      Whereas, The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), along with other medical organizations, opposes interference with the patient-clinician relationship and affirm the importance of this relationship in the provision of high-quality medical care; and\n      Whereas, ACOG affirms that individuals require access to safe, legal abortion, and that adolescents, people of color, those living in rural areas, those with low incomes, and incarcerated people can face disproportionate effects of restrictions on abortion access; and \n      Whereas, Despite public opinion and the growing need to increase access to high quality and equitable health care, including care to combat the maternal health crisis, many states and the Supreme Court have nonetheless indicated the threat of continued abortion restrictions; and \n      Whereas, One can look at Texas, where abortion is effectively outlawed by prohibiting abortion after six weeks, to see how restricted access to abortion can impact a person's care; and\n      Whereas, National Public Radio (NPR) reported that individuals seeking abortions in Texas have been put in potentially life-threatening situations and have needed to seek care outside of the state, which is unattainable for many individuals due to financial and logistical reasons; and \n      Whereas, In many states, abortion care is hard to access due to lack of health care infrastructure, education, and other factors; and \n      Whereas, As we continue to see the rights of women, girls, and people who can become pregnant restricted, New York City publicly declares that it is a safe haven for all those needing abortion-related care; and\n      Whereas, New York City and State are committed to providing care and support to those needing abortion-related care, and are acting swiftly to draft and pass abortion-related legislation furthering the protections of those seeking abortions both within the state and from other parts of the country; and \n      Whereas, Abortion is health care, and access to health care is a fundamental human right; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York declares New York City a safe city for all those in need of abortion-related care.\n\n\nEB/CP\nLS 9095/9101/9110\n05.27.2022",
