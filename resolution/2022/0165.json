  "Text": "Whereas, Domestic violence, sometimes known as intimate partner violence or relationship abuse, is usually defined as a pattern of abusive behavior in a relationship used by one partner to maintain or gain power and control over another partner; and\n      Whereas, Domestic violence is a leading cause of homelessness in New York City, in addition to evictions and overcrowding; and\n      Whereas, Domestic violence survivors often cannot stay with family members for fear of running into their abusers, and many lack the income to find permanent housing quickly; and\n      Whereas, The provision of safe emergency shelter is a primary tool for those fleeing domestic violence; and\n      Whereas, The domestic violence emergency shelter system was originally created to provide short-term respite for victims of domestic violence and their families who were fleeing imminent danger; and\n      Whereas, Within New York City, domestic violence shelters were created over several decades to house families rather than single adults; and\n      Whereas, New York City Human Resources Administration's domestic violence shelters served an average of 122 single adults per month in the first half of 2019; and\n      Whereas, Non-profit providers who operate these shelters are reimbursed by the New York State Office of Children and Family Services per person per night; and\n      Whereas, The reimbursement from the State is intended to cover the entire cost of operating domestic violence shelters, including rent, utilities, staffing, and services; and\n      Whereas, Any reduction in this reimbursement severely impacts the ability of the provider to cover the cost of operating the shelter; and\n      Whereas, The State reimbursement formula discourages domestic violence emergency shelter providers from placing a smaller family or single adult in a large apartment or room; and\n      Whereas, Single adult victims of domestic violence have a harder time accessing domestic violence shelters; and\n      Whereas, A.2583, sponsored by Assembly Member Andrew D. Hevesi, and S.15, sponsored by Senator Andrew Gounardes, would require the State to preserve the full reimbursement to providers who accommodate a single adult in a room configured for a family of two; and\n      Whereas, This legislation would help increase system-wide capacity for single adults who otherwise face serious obstacles to accessing the domestic violence shelter system; and\n      Whereas, If enacted, A.2583/S.15 would ensure that providers are not penalized for accommodating a single adult fleeing a dangerous situation; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, A.2583/S.15, authorizing certain shelters for victims of domestic violence to be reimbursed for any payment differential for housing a single individual in a room intended for double occupancy. \nSession 12\nJB/CD\nLS 2296\n11/21/23 \n\nSession 11\nCP\nLS #9996\nInt. #1061-2019",
