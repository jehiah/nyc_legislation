Hevesi, and S.15, sponsored by Senator Andrew Gounardes, would require the State to preserve the full reimbursement to providers who accommodate a single adult in a room configured for a family of two; and\n      Whereas, This legislation would help increase system-wide capacity for single adults who otherwise face serious obstacles to accessing the domestic violence shelter system; and\n      Whereas, If enacted, A.2583/S.15 would ensure that providers are not penalized for accommodating a single adult fleeing a dangerous situation; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, A.2583/S.15, authorizing certain shelters for victims of domestic violence to be reimbursed for any payment differential for housing a single individual in a room intended for double occupancy. \nSession 12\nJB/CD\nLS 2296\n11/21/23 \n\nSession 11\nCP\nLS #9996\nInt. #1061-2019",
