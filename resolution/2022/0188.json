  "Text": "Whereas, Hate crimes are a serious problem across the country in ; and \n\tWhereas, The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) recorded 7,314 hate crimes in the United States in 2019 compared to 5,479 in 2014; and  \n\tWhereas, The number of incidents may actually be much higher as many victims do not report to the authorities, and not all law enforcement departments report to the FBI; and \n\tWhereas, The number of hate crimes incidents in New York City dramatically increased from 256 in 2020 to 524 in 2021; and  \n\tWhereas, Anti-Semitism has been a particular motivator in many of the bias and hate crimes recorded in New York City and across the country; and  \n\tWhereas, In other big cities, like Los Angeles and Chicago, Jewish people were the most frequent targets of hate crimes in 2019 based on data from the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism (CSHE); and  \n\tWhereas, Hate crimes are often extremely violent; and \n      Whereas, For example, on December 28, 2019, the seventh night of Hanukkah, five people were stabbed by an intruder who broke into the home of a Hasidic rabbi in Monsey, New York,; and \n      Whereas, This act of terrorism came just weeks after four people were shot and killed by two attackers, fueled by anti-Semitism, who targeted a kosher supermarket in New Jersey; and  \n \tWhereas, New Yorkers and people across the country have the right to practice their religion without threat of violence or interference; and \n\tWhereas, With the increases in anti-Semitism and neo-Nazism, the right to free exercise of religion is under attack; and \n\tWhereas, Reports indicate white supremacist and neo-Nazi hate groups have targeted New York City for recruiting purposes, leaving pamphlets, posters, and hanging banners in various neighborhoods; and \n\tWhereas, This makes people feel threatened and unsafe in their communities; and  \n\tWhereas, In the past, when specific communities have been made the target of hate and violence, the federal government has convened task forces to investigate; and \n\tWhereas, For example, after numerous African-American churches were targeted in arson attacks between 1995 and 1996, then-President Bill Clinton established the National Church Arson Task Force; and  \n\tWhereas, This task force helped coordinate the local government and law enforcement responses to the arson attacks and prevention measures, which assisted communities rebuild their sense of safety; and \n\tWhereas, New York City has the largest population of Jewish people in the United States; and \n\tWhereas, New Yorkers and people throughout the United States have the right to feel safe while practicing their faith and going about their life; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the President to establish an anti-Semitism task force

problem across the country in ; and \\f1\\par\n\\tab\\f0 Whereas, The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) recorded 7,314 hate crimes in the United States in 2019 compared to 5,479 in 2014; and  \\f1\\par\n\\tab\\f0 Whereas, The number of incidents may actually be much higher as many victims do not report to the authorities, and not all law enforcement departments report to the FBI; and \\par\n\\f1\\tab\\f0 Whereas, The number of hate crimes incidents in New York City dramatically increased from 256 in 2020 to 524 in 2021; and  \\par\n\\f1\\tab\\f0 Whereas, Anti-Semitism has been a particular motivator in many of the bias and hate crimes recorded in New York City and across the country; and  \\par\n\\f1\\tab\\f0 Whereas, In other big cities, like Los Angeles and Chicago, Jewish people were the most frequent targets of hate crimes in 2019 based on data from the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism (CSHE); and  \\par\n\\f1\\tab\\f0 Whereas, Hate crimes are often extremely violent; and \\f1\\par\n\\pard\\ltrpar\\fi720\\sl480\\slmult1\\qj\\f0 Whereas, For example, on December 28, 2019, the seventh night of Hanukkah, five people were stabbed by an intruder who broke into the home of a Hasidic rabbi in Monsey, New York,; and \\par\nWhereas, This act of terrorism came just weeks after four people were shot and killed by two attackers, fueled by anti-Semitism, who targeted a kosher supermarket in New Jersey; and  \\par\n\\pard\\ltrpar\\sl480\\slmult1\\qj  \\tab Whereas, New Yorkers and people across the country have the right to practice their religion without threat of violence or interference; and \\par\n\\tab Whereas, With the increases in anti-Semitism and neo-Nazism, the right to free exercise of religion is under attack; and \\par\n\\f1\\tab\\f0 Whereas, Reports indicate white supremacist and neo-Nazi hate groups have targeted New York City for recruiting purposes, leaving pamphlets, posters, and hanging banners in various neighborhoods; and \\f1\\par\n\\tab\\f0 Whereas, This makes people feel threatened and unsafe in their communities; and  \\par\n\\f1\\tab\\f0 Whereas, In the past, when specific communities have been made the target of hate and violence, the federal government has convened task forces to investigate; and \\par\n\\tab Whereas, For example, after numerous African-American churches were targeted in arson attacks between 1995 and 1996, then-President Bill Clinton established the National Church Arson Task Force; and  \\f1\\par\n\\tab\\f0 Whereas, This task force helped coordinate the local government and law enforcement responses to the arson attacks and prevention measures\\f1 ,\\f0  which assisted communities rebuild their sense of safety; and \\par\n\\f1\\tab\\f0 Whereas, New York City has the largest population of Jewish people in the United States; and \\f1\\par\n\\tab\\f0 Whereas, New Yorkers and people throughout the United States have the right to feel safe while practicing their faith and going about their life; \\cf1 now, therefore, be it\\cf0\\f1\\par\n\\pard\\ltrpar\\fi720\\sl480\\slmult1\\qj\\f0 Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on the President to establish an anti-Semitism task force
