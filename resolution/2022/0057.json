  "Text": "Whereas, According to the United States (U.S.) Census Bureau's 2017 American Community Survey, nearly one million New York City (NYC) residents are of Puerto Rican descent; and\n      Whereas, Because Puerto Rico is an insular U.S. territory and not a state, Puerto Ricans lack the right to have voting representation in Congress and to participate fully in federal elections; and\n      Whereas, The United Nations has recognized Puerto Rico as a self-governing political entity under General Assembly Resolution 748; and\n      Whereas, According to the Council on Foreign Relations, \"Puerto Rico is a political paradox,\" facing a multi-layered economic and social crisis that is rooted in its long-standing status as a U.S. territory and has been compounded by government mismanagement over the years; and\n      Whereas, According to the Harvard Political Review, recent economic and social issues stemming from repeated natural disasters, mishandled federal assistance, and rising debt have underscored the urgency of re-evaluating Puerto Rico's status as a territory, prompting discussion of a democratic referendum on the issue; and\n      Whereas, Article 1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which the United States is a signatory and which it is required to recognize, establishes that all peoples have the right to self-determination and \"by virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development\"; and\n      Whereas, According to a press release by Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley on October 9, 2020, \"Puerto Rico's status as a U.S. territory has served as a roadblock to the Island's progress, inflicting over a century of hurt and harm on the Island's residents and depriving them of their fundamental right to determine their own future.\"; and\n      Whereas, Representative Nydia M. Vel�zquez of New York had introduced legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives on March 18, 2021, to recognize the right of the people of Puerto Rico to call a status convention through which they would exercise their right to self-determination; and\n      Whereas, In accordance with fundamental principles of human rights, Puerto Rico, rather than Congress, must determine its own future by having the authority to support its enfranchisement and democratic self-governance; now, therefore, be it\n      Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York calls on Congress to pass, and the President to sign, a bill in support of self-determination for Puerto Rico.\n\n\nSession 12\nRHP\nRes. 0057-2022\n1/6/23\n\nCD\nLS #5595\n3/3/22\n\nSession 11\nAH\nLS #16820\nReso.#1543-2021  \n\n\n\n\n2",
