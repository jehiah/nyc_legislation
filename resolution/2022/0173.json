  "Summary": "",
  "TextID": 72918,
  "Text": "Whereas, Consolidated Edison Company of New York (ConEd) supplies energy services to approximately 10 million people within New York City and Westchester County; and\n\tWhereas, In 2020, ConEd reported $10.647 billion in operating revenues, with total assets amounting to $50.967 billion; and\n\tWhereas, In January of 2022, City residents experienced dramatic and unexpected increases in their ConEd bills, caused by an increase in in the cost of energy; and\n\tWhereas, According to ConEd, the average energy price charged by power generators increased from $50 per megawatts per hour (MWh) in December 2022 to $140 per MWh in January of 2022; and\n      Whereas, This increase, coupled with the 10% increase in customer usage in January of 2022 due to cold weather, resulted in large monthly increases for some customers; and\n      Whereas, Many City residents are still dealing with the economic devastation caused by the pandemic; and\n      Whereas, As of February 2022, the City's unemployment rate was 7 percent, nearly twice the national rate, and the City had regained only 70 percent of its pandemic jobs deficit, in contrast to 91 percent nationally; and\n      Whereas, Accordingly, many City residents lack the financial resources to pay for such price increases; and\n      Whereas, Across NYS, almost 1.3 million residential gas and electric customers are 60 or more days behind on their bills, totaling over $1.7 billion; and \n      Whereas, The current outstanding debt owed to utilities is over double the debt owed before the pandemic; and\n      Whereas, Over 411,500 City and Westchester residents are 60 or more days behind on their ConEd bills, totaling over $819 million owed; and\n      Whereas, According to Richard Berkley, executive director of the Public Utility Project, the problem of unpaid utility debt has reached a new high, may result in multi-generational debt and is a \"massive crisis\"; and \n      Whereas, As the statewide moratorium on utility shut-offs for nonpayment expired on December 21, 2021, people behind on their utility bills have received termination notices; and\n      Whereas, According to David Springe, Executive Director of the National Association of State Utility Consumer Advocates, \"People end up unable to keep their home or apartment or dwelling because they lose electricity or they lose water, they end up homeless\"; and\n      Whereas, Numerous financial relief programs exist for City residents unable to pay their utility bills; and\n      Whereas, The Home Energy Assistance Program (HEAP) is a NYS administered relief program to help low-income residents pay the cost of heating their homes; and\n      Whereas, Qualifying applicants to HEAP can receive up to $751 in heating assistance, but eligible customers must be receiving SNAP, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or Supplementary Security Income;
