Bollinger, Board of Regents of the University of Michigan, et. al., (undergraduate lawsuit) and Grutter v. Bollinger, Board of Regents of the University of Michigan, et. al., (law school lawsuit), wherein the legal brief submitted by the Bush administration mischaracterizes the University of Michigan's admissions policy as a \"quota\" system, and demonstrates a profound insensitivity to civil rights.",
