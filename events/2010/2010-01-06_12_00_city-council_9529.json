Though not present on January 6, 2010, Council Member Seabrook was present at the Recessed Meeting held on January 21, 2010 and is, therefore, considered present for attendance and voting purposes for the Charter Meeting of January 6, 2010.  Council Member Seabrook chose to cast an affirmative vote on January 21, 2010 for the items presented for a vote at this Charter Meeting held on January 6, 2010 (for revised vote, please see the Charter Meeting votes printed in these Minutes of the Charter Meeting of January 6, 2010).",
